theyve
given

debate
going
character
actually
quite
frustrating
feel
like

jin
one
see
defending
non
including

benefit
defends
non
even
non
around
nullifying
make
look

non

catches
flack
nullifying
wants
look
good
friends
argument
perfect

hes
incredibly
flawed
character
acted
selfishly
made
mistakes
imo
hes
redeemable
even
non

whats
happened
hes
seen
friends
capable
drugging
someone
yes
lies

lots
people
theyre
scared
shitless
especially

leads
ongoing
debate
raging

whether

im
going
disappointed
turns
stock
cliche
