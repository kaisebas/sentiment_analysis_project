The GHOSTING is what has me livid. I get it. Money talks. They signed a deal with Viu to use our love of Bible to allow Viu to softly enter new markets without needing to invest, so in exchange Viu gave them probably more money than they would for a Viu Original. But then BOC SHOULD SAY SOMETHING OR REPLY to the HUNDREDS of messages, posts, asking for info on global streaming on their socials.

They just needed to put out one post explaining and saying sorry guys we love you but we needed to do this to be able to make 4 Minutes the way it deserved. I would have understood.

But putting out a WARNING to not watch on non-authorized channels when there are no authorized channels except for 8-9 countries is INSANE AND INSULTING while also providing instructions and time lines on how to make the series trend. They had time to create THREE instruction posts but could not do one addressing the lack of Global Platform?! Ugh.

Why do they keep doing this to Bible. Bible needs to find a new company ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Fuaiz is 18 years old, he is so young i didnt know that üò∂

That was insane, something that caught my attention is that one of the doctors is studying cardiac arrests and a woman gave the example that she could see 4 minutes in the future and here the same thing happens to Great, could be the dude at the beggining him??? Ans thats how he got this power

It's the most natural thing to do.. 'cause your body can't lie. It irks me in situations where couples who have been apart for a while or have made up after a big disagreement barely share a kiss or a proper hug to mark the occasion. what in the world is that about anyway?

Listen. I was so ready to throw my hard earned money at another streaming site just for this show. I really was. But then BoC pulled this crap and left me no choice. (I will definitely pay to rewatch the ‚Äòright‚Äô way if and when they announce a global streaming site. But in the meantime‚Ä¶üòÆ‚Äçüí®) I‚Äôve waited too long.

If BoC does nothing else right, they will give you a quality production. And I mean everything and everyone was so good. The pacing, the acting, the cinematography.

The NC scene was ü•µ but also kinda soft? Bas and Fuaiz were so sweet with each other.

Bas stood out so much to me. Glad he‚Äôs getting the chance to shine. And I love that Bible and Bas have a good sibling relationship. For a second there, I was convinced otherwise.

Yep, I knew I would not be disappointed. A really great start. Gagged and seated for the foreseeable future.

So after a whole bunch of monkeying around, I finally got a Hong Kong VPN & a Viu subscription, and it worked beautifully until (I kid you not) the start of the NC scene when it started to buffer. I had to turn the quality down to 240p, which is hardly worth paying for. :( At least now if I have to sail the high seas üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è, I won't feel guilty.

So far, totally worth the hassle. The usual high BoC production standards, and BIBLE, YES, BIBLE. IT'S BIBLE! And Bas. I'm impressed how he really does appear older than Bible here after looking so much younger than him in KP.

I've got no words for the NC scene, and honestly, who needs them. That was amazing, and not just from an explicitness standpoint, but by how well written and directed it was. The dialogue felt really real to me. (Anytime someone says how certain actors can't possibly kiss because they're so young, 18 yo Fuaiz can say "hold my beer and watch this!")

I'm looking forward to the plot development and can't wait to see how Bible & Jes work together.

BoC's Cinematography
Work was the slowest it's been in a hot minute and it made the time DRAG by. Jesus Christ. But I finally got to watch (after I had to restart my computer... nobody wanted me to watch this show).

Holy fuck this was spectacular. Because I was looking at this thread, I knew the sex scene was coming, but honstly I didn't even care. I was so engrossed in the story.

The music was incredible, and of course BoC can't be beat when it comes to cinematography and color grading. The shots in Tongkla's house were so pretty. I loved the lighting. I also loved the location of their underground gambling place. Such a cool abandoned neighborhood.

Speaking of that sex scene - okay BasFuiaz, go off. Not only was that sex scene hot, but it was *realistic*. The way they talked to each other during sex was so natural and real, and how they both didn't come at the same time. I felt like this was the most real sex scene that I've seen in a BL ever. (And thank you Fuiaz for almost showing us Bas's asshole. I was like "You know - you could spread those cheeks a little wider...")

I'm so fucking glad to see Bible acting again. He's so good. Never over the top (even when he was doing over the top stuff as Vegas - it was all in pocket and natural). I'd never seen Jes act before, but he was great too.

My fave of the episode though? Den. Job was SO CUTE. He didn't get much time to shine in KinnPorsche, but he was excellent here, and the glasses made him look super hot.

The woman who played Mandee was also really good. I felt her pain. And her son definitely isn't just some rando. Maybe her son is dead, and she's also travelled back, and can't handle it?

I have so many questions! I can't wait to start theorycrafting when we have our footing and really know more about what's happening. That was one of the best parts of DFF for me - figuring out what was going to happen. So, we heard a gunshot the first time that Great had an episode when he was in his apartment elevator and he clutched his abdomen right where Tyme was injured in the cold open. Are we in an alternate timeline? Did Great go back more than 4 minutes, since he can see him and Tyme in the future (past)?

 Hidden Agenda
It's just my opinion, but if the release is going to be so limited, and you are going to instruct international fans not to watch it or share clips, it's understandable. So don't promote so heavily it on a global platform like YouTube or IG. Just promote it well in your country, and let those fans enjoy it to the fullest, with our blessings and good wishes.

It seems counterintuitive to promote internationally and then act this way.

5 minutes in my watch and the question that 1st arrived in my head is, THIS IS CINEMATOGRAPHY !! Just...everything looks so so good !! I have a very particular sense of aesthetics (which is why I feel Japanese dramas and movies the most well shot) and 4 Minutes was hitting that HARD. I had to stop watching and simply admire the shots for a moment. Also, why is gmmtv not shooting more shows in wider shots? We all have wider screens in our tabs/laptops/mobiles these days, what's stopping them? Why's Trainee is the only one?

Great having a superpower of time traveling while having a heart attack is making me angtsy. Sir, don't go dying on ep 6 now.

Even though I caved in and got the Viu sub since its kinda cheap, I am very much distraught that there's like a hundred different platforms for BL. Couldn't BOC have given this to iQiyi, I thought they had a good thing going already ü§∑

I realized that they focused on Tonkla's expressions more than Korn's in this whole scene. No complaints cos I am thrilled. It made me feel things... but what could be the reason for this?

All this ep i was like. . Oh my gawd Bas..

Also waah the story looks promising/the production looks top notch. Durex and the cat food (marketing was subtle) it was a good start

Also that nc sceneüíÄI've only seen that stuff in manga... I need time to process it wow... And glad to see bas and job hereü§ì

I love the showüëç sammon writing is still so cool‚ù§and the first scene was sus (jesbible knock outüíÄwhat?)

I don't care if it's sad/happy or open ending ( i was getting bored of romcoms with polished flowery ending anyways)... So i needed some spice.. Hope it's dark and makes my brain work(i needed a thriller bl)

So far kp(action) and dff(horror/thriller) have not disappointed me so i have more expectations for this showüëç(plotwise)... Also i think Bas character is grey .. thymegreat by Jesbible is nice too... üëç

Let's see how this goesüëç

Hey, did you all catch the same thing I did? So, Great's heart stopped at the start of the episode, and now he's living his life again but with the power to see 4 minutes into the future... so maybe he can save Tyme from being murdered? AM I RIGHT? AM I RIGHT? We're getting a happy ending, right? R I G H T ?

THAT was CINEMA. Everything was soo good what the fuck. Acting, cinematography, NC scenes, music, editing. One episode in and it has majorly upstaged Kinnporsche. This is bananas. We have one for the history books on our hands. Also the production value is at the level of basically any high budget american show which is CRAZY. I didn't think we'd ever really get there with BL. Damn BOC just knows how to shake things up, and how to bring it. Nobody else in the game is doing it like them right now.

Great that's called a HIT AND RUN. Tsk tsk tsk. I guess she was trying to commit üò© Glad he stopped the second time though.

I usually really hate medical shows but I always find myself HOOKED on whatever Sammon writes - Manner of Death, Triage, DFF and now this. (Side Note: I really want Transplant - the Triage/Manner of Death sequel).

Korn and Tonkla and their softcore porn scene ü´£ Korn clearly so far in the closet he's discovered Narnia - poor Tonkla I feel quite bad for him. The black cat after Korn left was kinda creepy.

Sitting at the opposite end of that massive table is so petty Great. Clearly there's something going on between him and his Dad. Bon Appetit Ka to you too üòÇ

Oh so Korn and Great are step brothers I guess. Same Dad's different Mum's.

Really intrigued by Great's powers - why does he have them? Where did they come from? What's the lesson here? Number 4 being a recurring theme will mean something.

It's weird that he saw 4 minutes ahead and ended up NOT seeing Manee. Like the first time it was to avoid killing her, the second tike it was to ... see him and Doc have sex? Is he reliving his past? Because that clearly wasn't 4 minutes in the future.

I'm SAT. I'm invested. Activating chokehold. Also i've just missed Bible on my screen and I like that he's not a raging psychopath in this role. Sammon always gets me with her mystery element and this feels VERY Sammon. Thank God this came when it did because i've been fighting for my life to find a BL that's got me hooked since Unknown (My Stand In was really good though and TLDHLB has me pretty invested).

I think so too. The opening scenes show us Jes shot and a man with long black hair getting rescusitated with a big 4 on the wall above his head.

The doc conducting interviews spoke to a lady that explained the 4 minutes situation WHILE HAVING A HEART ATTACK and when Bible got off the elevator with his INCREDIBLE LOW CUT SHIRT he grasped his chest like when you have a heart attack. And the other person said they could see themselves when having a heart attack. So I think the whole series is what Bible is feeling while being rescusitated as we saw in the opening scenes....he is reviewing his life reel while under this awake asleep state.

Yup.. we are watching bible's past.. i wrote that fan theory.. if you pay attention to what other patients does, the last woman describes it perfectly.

Overall, what is happening is that bible is in hospital (opening scene) and doctor is trying to revive him through shocks...so bible is reliving/thinking of his past like a normal life (without realizing his current true condition and living life normally) and the only abnormal thing is 4 min. in future

Summary, we are in bible's thought/dream world. 4 min. into the future is actually his past. His heart aches in elevator etc are linked to real life shocks he is getting from the machine... and since this is dream world, time does not flow well... and that black cat .. if you have seen Matrix is the aberration...

Mind eventually will have to adjust between dream world and reality

My guy how could you hit her again lol. Take another route, gorgeous.

Intrigued by the plot. Honestly very disinterested in Korn aside from his relationship with Great. I know people don‚Äôt mind the age gap with Tonkla but it made me uncomfortable, and I didn‚Äôt really enjoy how he and Tonkla spoke to each other - it added to how juvenile he is. I‚Äôm mildly curious about how they met I guess lol.

Mostly interested in whatever is going on with Great, and I like that his love interest is a doctor! I feel like that will be fun to explore.

Never have I been happier that I chose to watch the premiere of a show on my tablet because boy would that have been awkward on the living room tv!

As for the rest of the show, I‚Äôm curious as to why it seems that no one has told the police that the accident was intentional. It should have been cleared up a while ago and Great shouldn‚Äôt have to take responsibility because it wasn‚Äôt his fault.

I‚Äôm also still very much on the fence about how much I trust sugar baby.

When Jes the Doc picked up his phone after she confessed to both docs I totally thought he was calling the detective/cops to let them know what she said! But nope, he was just calling to get the OR prepped. And I was like OMG SOMEONE CALL THE COPS cause what if she dies in surgery?! So then I was like ok well it's good that she told BOTH docs so there were two witnesses! Just in case she dies. Since Jes will be a love interest they may not belive he is telling the truth later.

ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I know. And we are all upset about their terrible communication failures....setting that aside, the fact they created this masterpiece of an ep1 truly is spectacular. And I am completely OK with how they chose to stream assuming the money they got in exchange was what allowed them to make this masterpiece of an episode.

I just wish they would have communicated clearly and honestly what they were doing.

I‚Äôve noticed that the thing I struggle with with Thai BLs is the first 15 or so minutes of the first episode when characters are being introduced. I always get lost and lose interest, so many a BL have been dropped for this reason. Honestly 4 minutes was no different. I struggled to follow along in this ep and had to watch the first 40 minutes or so twice to understand wtf was going on. It felt like I was introduced to too many people too soon and felt overwhelmed by it all. I first watched the uncut version and the nc scene was completely cut off. The scenes moved from Tonkla saying he‚Äôs not just good at talking to Korn seated at the family table, and so much was lost with this cut version‚Ä¶and I don‚Äôt mean the nc scene. The post nc scene where Korn leaves in a rush and Tonkla sees a black cat feels like important info that the audience should have. Anyway, watching the cut version added to my confusion, but after the second watch I get what‚Äôs going on and I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next.

The first shirt that Great has on is everything!!!! I love seeing rich male characters who don‚Äôt have to wear conventional suits dress up. I get lots of fashion inspo from them

Lastly, what time did Korn start his day bc how did he get a promotion, go see the business that seems to be far from his dad‚Äôs office, go see Tonkla, have sex w Tonkla, drive to family home and have dinner with his family all before 7pm?! And where did he get the energy for all this?

Korn's day is a typical day for me minus my meditation at 4am, workout at 5am, etc ü§£

When cut versions cut more than just the NC scenes (e.g. Cooking Crush) it's always a disaster! How long was the cut version? Was that the only cut you noticed?

I was watching ep 3 and thinking to myself: maybe Ton Kla's BF didn't pick up the phone last episode because he knew 2 things already:

that TK brother is gone

where the bodies are buried And the reason why he had known this was because he's the one who dumped the guy there after he got him killed? But after those Ep 2 and 3 endings I don't know what to say about dear doctor

I didn't think this about Korn when he hung up on TK the first time (he answered but hung up cause he was freaking out about the emergency at the gambling den)

HOWEVER, when he saw all the missed calls I wondered and these thoughts crossed my mind. But also he was dealing with a lot of chaos in his new important job and TK is not his boyfriend so he is not his priority. He is his sugar baby and his well being is not his main concen and he won't make time for him. He has a new important job and his fiance/girlfriend is his priority given her dad is the one getting him out of the pickle he got himself into.

But you have very valid points and maybe you are completely right.

My heart is overflowing with happiness and excitement üò≠. I finally get to watch one of my most anticipated shows without jumping through hoops. I literally watched Ep 1 and stopped because I couldn't bear all the nonsense surrounding streaming availability. It really made it hard for me to enjoy the series.



Watching on a big screen makes a world of difference!! I was never ready for a close up of Korn's sexy bum and the way Tonkla was semi parting it üëÄü´¶. Firm üëÄ start to the series. I loved Ep 1, now onwards to Ep 2 Comment Image

So first thoughts on episode 1 (y‚Äôall can laugh at me): Great and Korn are brothers, yes? Great is the ‚Äúgood‚Äù, poor little rich kid, yeah? Korn is slowly being jaded by his family‚Äôs secret, dirty business. Everyone has secrets (duh), Tonkla has some he‚Äôs keeping from Korn, too. Tyme has little empathy for anyone, let alone his patients. (He‚Äôll probably learn that from Great) He clearly doesn‚Äôt like working for the public hospital system - where his talents are possibly needed. (I thought the suicidal woman could be Tonkla‚Äôs mother? But probably not.)

Ahahahaha the dinner! He‚Äôs so over his family lol

I just love how everyone is always making a distinction between drugs, alcohol and nicotine. Boy do I have news for you.

Tyme is so jaded, he hates being poor, eh?

So my theory is: Great actually got into that accident when he hit that woman, and he was hurt badly, and all we see is an alternate reality, ie what would have happened had he been able to see 4 minutes ahead. I‚Äôm guessing the moral of the stories ultimately is about choices, the ones we make and the ones we don‚Äôt make, and all the main characters are dead or near dead.

How can BOC make something as great and exceptional as Kinn/Porsche and then put their two heartthrobs in something as dull as Man Suang. Even Jeff Satur and Barcode left the studio, and they are two up and comers. Why would BOC limit its audience on their latest release???

Christ. I was not ready for that.

Cinematography is amazing. Story line very compelling. And the NC?

What to say? One of the most realistic looking I have ever seen. Even with the throwing away of the bottle of lube.

Fuaiz is completely blowing me away. The way he uses his eyes. No wonder the camera is focusing on his face.

And me feeling especially old and creepy. He turned 18 last January.

Bas is also killing it. Not only in the NC scene. The thrusts...

But also when he walks in that office and the relationship with his half brother.

Jes and Bible. They are great.

8 episodes in total.

That is not what I'm used too. But with this high quality I don't complain.

So, I feel really dumb. I got VPN and was able to watch the 1st episode (sultry edition) no issues, but now I can't watch the 2nd episode on VPN. Viu says content not available.

For reference the VPN is Express VPN and I'm connecting to HK (both 1 and 2 with no luck).

Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: Apparently HK no longer works for Sultry/Director's Cut (How I watched episode 1) on VPN. Viu won't load with Thialand, so I ended up trying the Phillipines and that works. Hopefully this won't be a round robin guessing game each week for the episodes.

Lol. This might be the first time I will willingly watch a censored version.

In my head NC scenes like this fit more to a "trashy" series, but 4 minutes seems to really put emphasis on the story and shots and overall cinematography to the extent that the NC scene is just taking me out of the story XD.

So far really nice start!
