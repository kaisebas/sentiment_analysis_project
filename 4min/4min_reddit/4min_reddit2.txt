PLEASE so many people on twitter are like 'omg Tyme is a TRAITOR' and I'm like... He's checking his hair and flexing in the mirror, he's not just after info üòÇ I loved it so much, especially when he'd go from suave and hitting on Great to obviously inwardly facepalming at himself.

What imomen said - basically it implies that Tyme has ulterior motives for approaching Great. We saw him pause when he saw the card on the flowers, which possibly means that he recognized his name. BUT just because he has another motive doesn't mean that he can't also be motivated by finding Great hot/adorable af!

I was not expecting to see a CFNM scene. That is a very niche kink.

Are they related or did Korn just call her dad "uncle" out of respect? It would be super weird if they are actual cousins by blood.

Quick PSA: last week I watched by accident the not so sultry version, and then watched again the sultrier version after I figured out I had the wrong vpn‚Ä¶ anyways the sultrier version also has other scenes (not nc) that are cut from the other version. For instance there was a scene where great and Korn talk after the dinner at their parents that was cut from the shorter version. I found that overall the sultrier version gave more context to the story and of course the great nc scene

Jet playing a character who isn't a total shithead challenge? Failed. I'd love to see him being someone nice sometime. His face is so expressive and interesting to look at that I'd love to watch him and not want to chuck boiling water in it. I was hoping we'd get some JetMio action... guess not.

I was scared there for a second that we were going to get a hetero sex scene. Hetero????? Gross. But Fasai is really pretty. That thigh shot though...

So, Korn probably knew about the gambling all along and was lying?

Them not showing Tongkla's brother's face... interesting. My theory is that we saw Tongkla in the future in the cold opening. I think that he was killing who killed his brother in the place where it happened. Also the fact that it deliberately didn't show us his brother's face is that his brother is maybe Tyme or Den or someone that we've seen already. I think he was killing Korn. Or he was killing his brother, and all of this is an act?

Tyme being all flustered about seeing Great again was adorable. Checking his muscles and tucking his shirt in. And seeing Bible all nervous when Tyme slotted himself between Great's legs to check his wound was cute since Bible has such a cool aura.

Tyme and Win being instant simps on the job? Loser icons.

So... why is a doctor interested in closing illegal gambling dens? Are the timelines all out of order?

Poor Tongkla. You could tell he was just carved out. I hope it's not all an act and he's just a liar who murdered his brother, but the fact that Korn just completely forgot about him in his time of need - I mean, I get that you were busy because you fucked up your illegal gambling house, but you don't have to be an asshole about it - and he just lost his brother and knows that no justice will come of it? That's a person who will do anything because they have nothing left to lose.

VIP this episode is Anne. I love how she's just trying to blow up Tyme's rizz. Him yanking Great's chart away from her was hilarious.

The thing that keeps frustrating me is that I keep trying to figure out the disconnects and then going 'wait, no' because I remember something that connects it. The only thing I feel like could be possible is that Korn and Tonkla's timeline is before everything that happens with Great...

From that woman who had a heart attack in the first episode, I think we‚Äôre dealing with two different timelines. In the first one, Great almost dies and can‚Äôt save Tyme, who started investigating all the gambling stuff... maybe because of the suicidal woman‚Äôs son (????) I don‚Äôt know. In the second one, Great gets the power to see the future to fix everything he did wrong (and repeats), because his heart stopped and you get that kind of power (????). I don‚Äôt know, like if you reach your thirties and you‚Äôre still a virgin, you get to read people‚Äôs minds lol.

I want to know how much delusion I'm working with here, but this is my take.

Great theories, though Tyme is interested only because he knows he is a brother and part of the mafia family. He made sure to mention he knew his name.

Tongkla being the actual killer is possible, I haven't thought about it!

Way more questions than answers for me from this one!!!!! I had to watch the cut version, which is 3 minutes shorter than the sultrier version, so I don't know what I missed.

I'm not sure who died! Tonkla's dead brother was referred to as nong-chai or younger brother. Dome doesn't look like he'd be younger. Title, either. But he sure is a dick, isn't he? (Just like Top in DFF.)

I'm loving Tyme so far. Kind of cold on the outside, but soft and sensitive on the inside. Jes is very impressive, and he gets hotter to my eyes with every scene!

Bas/Korn looks a lot like Mile/Kinn. Same hair, same styling. I don't imagine that's 100% coincidence.

I hope we get an Akuma cameo every episode!

Bible continues to slay. That is all.

Off to watch it again!

I think the beginning scenes are in the future but they tie them in so good. They showed us Tonkla smoking EXACTLY like this later in the episode to tie him back to this person we are not supposed be able to recognize but like Fuaiz's eyes GAVE HIM AWAY IMMEDIATELY. I gotta go back and watch but do we know for sure he is killing Title?

I mean the police investigation definitely could tie title to Tonkla'a bro' death due to circumstantial evidence since they were there together. But what if they are throwing us off cause that rage could be directed at Korn. Rage like that often happens when Love goes wrong and you find out he had something to do with your brother's death?

Crazy theory time:

So, the stuff with Tongkla/Korn/Win is all in the future, and not the same timeline that we're seeing with Great. So, for some reason that will be revealed later, Jes is trying to close down Korn's gambling den. Maybe because he is Tongkla's brother and knows about his involvement with Korn. Tyme was the person in the body bag. And Tongkla kills Korn in retribution. So, Great has to come back to change this past so Tyme doesn't die.

This will get holes poked in it in an instant, but I'm just throwing it out there.

EDIT: Or, Tyme is using Great as an in to take down this company. Tyme falls in love with Great, but gets killed for it - Tongkla kills Korn.

The only thing is I‚Äôm pretty sure Tongkla calls his brother nong not phi when hes crying over him, so if Thyme did die he‚Äôd have to be the younger brother which I‚Äôm not sure I buy lol

Yes! I was thinking the same...the brother that died must be someone we already saw... I was thinking Tyme as well...aand that connects with the first scene of the first episode, when Tyme was being shoot at. It was him right?

Maybe they are brothers that don't live together, and are doing this -ton with Korn and now Tyme with great - to avenge their parents or something... Maybe they worked at the gambling farm and got killed for it or something ... nobody can know Tyme and ton are brother...thus the disconnect btw the houses. Tyme does seem very insistent in pursing great, it looks cute but it has more to it..

What do we know for sure, it can't be Korn, nor great...

If it is in the future...it could be anyone else, but Tyme makes sense... Could be too close to DFF though...( I haven't watched it all but I know the reveal at the end was connected to brother's)

I don't like this...the show is so well made but it's going to be one of those too close to reality... Give me the same quality but with some fluff and just a bit of conflict to make it interesting...I have a feeling everyone is dead already or going to!!

Fun fact before the episode starts - people who have had near death experiences and died-came back often report that they have issues wearing watches or with technology because the electromagnetism in their body is all wiggidy schwiggidy (the scientific term, of course)

I love the mystery. I love it when the show doesn't hold your hand but lets you figure out things throughout the show. I just hope it will make sense at the end. :)

I don't even care if it's a BL show, still would watch it as a straight one.

I am soooo intrigued by the timeline here and what's going on because we know that we're seeing things out of order, it's just a matter of piecing it all together!

Thoughts:

something I loved about this episode is the way that they put in fluff and comedy. It can be difficult to do that with a show that's focused on action and intrigue but they managed, here, and it is TOP tier. Also, can we pause for a moment to reflect on the fact that it seems like Great is seeing himself have sex with Tyme BEFORE it happens?? Like of course the boy is having gay panic!! And then I'm wondering if he's had sex before or not, and whether he's been with a man before or not...

I have a lot of sympathy for Korn in this episode. He had this job dropped on him and didn't want him, but he obviously wants to do well at it and to make his father happy. It doesn't surprise me that he's feeling stress over it and is getting tense, especially when he makes a monumental screw-up. Our sympathies are with Tonkla because we know what's going on with him, but Korn doesn't. Also DAMN that scene with Fasai was everything! And I've now seen more of Bas' butt in the last two weeks than I have in the last two years, lmao.

I saw someone else say that they were hoping for JetMio, but I am actually SO RELIEVED that didn't happen. We have enough going on without adding in another couple. Title is a Grade A asshole and has me questioning how and why Great came to be friends with him tbh...

I am so curious about the connections here. We have the woman in the hospital who lost her son, and we know something happened to Korn's mother. We know that something happened to Tonkla's brother but we don't know who is brother is for sure, yet. AND we know that Tyme gets shot and that Tonkla kills someone, but we don't know what goes down there... We've been told that things in the show are happening out of order and that people may not know what time they're in, etc, so my brain is going about fifty miles a minute trying to figure all of this out, lol. About the only thing that seems to be linear so far is Great hitting the woman -> taking her flowers -> seeing Tyme -> then seeing him later... BUT we also showed a snippet last week that seemed to be of the woman still dying, so what's happening here? I feel like I need to go back and rewatch to get a better idea of what the possible timeline could be, but it could also be that we just don't have enough info yet.

It feels like Tonkla's storyline is definitely happening at a different time, but the question is - when? Is it possible that it happened earlier...? The woman mentioned her son being Great's age, so I feel like that means that it's either Title, Dome or Tonkla, with I guess Title or Dome being more likely since Tonkla has a brother? ü§î

Can't be title cause Title has money and an influential father.

She said her son tried to make money but lost all of it. What if her son was a gambler or part of the gambling business?

Right now my main theory, and I‚Äôm always wrong, is Great is creating alternate timelines and in one of them Dome dies and we‚Äôre seeing the result of the timeline where Great doesn‚Äôt change anything.

So my theory is Dome is Tongkla‚Äôs brother. But again, I‚Äôm always wrong lol

ü§Ø Already because every time I was like ‚ÄòOh ok that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶nope, never mind.‚Äô Lol. I for one love a good plot heavy series and even if I don‚Äôt get it now(and I mean these timelines, what??) I love all the little twists.

Poor Tonkla, he‚Äôs going through it. But like, I also knew my boy wasn‚Äôt that innocent. Didn‚Äôt expect a full on murder though. And Korn, honey, get it together. Like it did not take long at for him to screw things up. So much for Ton‚Äôs little pep talk + pep sex combo ü•≤

Nurse Anne, clock him sis. Tyme trying to act like he didn‚Äôt care was cute. I‚Äôm sure he has ulterior motives but I mean it‚Äôs Bible, he said might as well get me a good time to.

I also just need Great to keep better company because sir, who is talking about I know something fun we can do, murder üò≠ His initial reaction was not big enough for me. It would have been an immediate nope as soon as he said he had his girl locked up. Police!

I AM SO CONFUSED. BUT I LOVE IT SM.

like i know that tonkla is def the person at the beginning, was it him that killed his brother and lied about it? Cuz if not (he killed his brother's killer), it would be damn weird for the police to let that same rock remain at that place after a freaking person already died because of it. So either tonkla is a mastermind liar and actor (lets go bitcvh), or this is a wonky time episode with time traveling/leaps and shi (i hated inception so istg)

And for the brother himself, maybe tonkla's brother is the accident lady's son? Cuz tonkla was like "why did it have to be you" cuz maybe both of them were struggling for money but his little brother was struggling more? this one i'm kinda not sure about cuz a lot of things wouldn't add up.

Another theory (about the brother cuz bro is making me mad like who r u man) is that maybe the person who dome was talking to near the lockers, (seemed kinda romantic??) was tonkla's younger brother. and bc he promised to meet up, tonkla's brother went looking for dome? and that's why he ended up at that place where something happened???? if this were to be true, i'm gonna assume that he didn't get oomphed by the rock, and it was same place but different timing and circumstances. The rock that win found was from title's whole tantrum thing not tonkla's brothers thing.

But honestly, what's most likely gonna happen is that they will reveal these things to be a couple/few different timelines. This is mainly because 1: this whole series is about time, 2: the place with the light tower thingie came up like 3 times. this probably means that a bunch of things happened there but different ways. I would bet that great's power allows him to also jump to different timelines, not just see 4 minutes into the future.

okay so LAST THING. i'm actually SO happy that fuaiz is getting a bigger role, and I hope he has a LOT to do with the plot. also bro be pulling like crazyyyy i gotta get in line fr

Writing this before reading any other comments so I may be completely wrong. Only watched it once.

THIS IS SOOOOO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!!

OK, DYING to see the photo Tonkla was holding of his brother üëÄ WHO IS HIS BRO?! I don't think he is the shareholder that Fah's dad had killed off (the guy with the unbrella in theflashback). Cause if Tonkla's bro was rich enough to be a shareholder Tonkla wouldn't need Korn's money.

So guessing Tonkla's bro maybe was the hacker? But at the end maybe the girl from the gambling place with the USB drive was the hacker?

Did she really give the USB to Doc Tyme at the end üëÄ I have no idea I didn't have time to rewind or record or rewatch. Ugh. It looked like him though and he was dressed all in black and he obviously seemed to know Great at the hospital and Great had the HOT AF üî• Flashbacks or Flashforwards so it seems like Doc Tyme DEFINITELY knows Great from before and not just from the papers flying.

Unless the doc and the police officers are just FALLING IN LUST IMMEDIATELY AND INSTANTLY with Great and Tonkla respectively ü•µüî• when Doc Tyme was moving inbetween Great's legs to stitch him up THEIR CHEMISTRY WAS SUFFOCATING ME OMFGGGGG üî•ü•µüî•ü•µüî•ü•µüî•ü•µüî•ü•µüî•

TITLE is a dick with a well connected dad since he offered Great his dad's help if anything went wrong with the lady Great hit with his car last week.

Title's location for the murder plot maybe coincidentally is the same place where Fah's dad had the shareholder and/or the hacker murdered? Maybe it's the go to place to make someone disappear? My city has a place like that so it's possible it is just a coincidence and ofcourse the rock will tie the two crimes together and probably get Great into trouble.

The way Doc Tyme was randomly in that car elevator parking and aggressively tried to get Great's Line ID is sus - unless we consider Great/Bible is FINE AF AND I COULD TOTALLY BELIEVE DOC WAS JUST HOT FOR HIM üòÇüî•ü•µ But if we are analyzing plot, Doc Tyme has an anterior motive probably.

Bas completely nude another week in a row AND I AM NOT MAD. The slurping üí¶üëÖ sound though when he was eating Fah out though was not as hot as when he moaned with Tonkla last week ngl ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Tonkla last week was definitely stressed out and hiding something from Korn when Korn arrived last week. Was it just the drugs (empty baggie from today)? Or was Tonkla in cahoots with his bro to screw over Korn?

Or is Tonkla's bro's death unrelated and just there to throw us off? Like Title and View tried to throw us off? ü§î

UPDATE:

After thinking more about today's episode here is my current theory on Great.

Sadly we knew this from ep1. Korn is cheating on that girl, Fah, WITH Tonkla. When he spoke with his dad from Tonkla's place before they finished round 2 he told his dad he was with Fah (his girlfriend/fiance). Tonkla is just Korn's sugar baby.

This series is already gonna be iconic omg. The twists they keep pulling. I never know wtf to expect next.

The camera shots, cinematography, the editing, music, sound editing. Everything is üíØ immaculate.

I was shocked from the first second of this ep onward. Expectations are irrelevant bc you can't predict anything.

I knew Fuaiz's character was going to meet JJ's but holy fck the way they met. And we still didn't see who his brother was. I knew Korn was just using him as like a sugar baby situation. But wow we got Bas booty again üçë

Jes is gorgeous and so hot in the all black outfit like boi I SAW you primping in the mirror bro don't even lie you were tryna hit üëÄ Like no gimme the chart üìã I'll stitch it up myself üëÄ

I'm digging Jes & Bible so far!

I can't believe Great was friends with Title like he is a rich scumbag, I wonder who his father is. I thought maybe the uncle but Idk.

The plot threads and threading. üòµ‚Äçüí´

So HK had the uncensored for ep1 but people are reporting that ep2 in HK is censored. People are also saying that Singapore has censored (so no NC and also some scenes are removed even if not NC).

Most are able to access both versions cut and uncut through Thailand and Philippines so far.

As far as we know, no. But Tyme seems to have ulterior motives for getting close to Great. So he is trying to get Great's phone number as part of his plan with the Gambling site.

Okay so, episode 2.

Poor Great is having an absolute time of it. He's going to need therapy after all of this shit.

What does Dr Thyme want from Great? He seems way too invested this early.

Oh so Korn decided to strip and go down on Fasai then, whilst also ignoring his boyfriend(?) who's unidentified brother was just found dead in the very same place Korn's own brother was the night before with his friend Title who might actually he a psychopath. I don't think I like Korn anymore.

I get this feeling that all of these seemingly individual stories are going to link up at some point like a jigsaw puzzle and we'll all collectively be like 'Omg that makes so much sense now'. Unidentified brother, Korn living 2 different lives, Dr Thyme's motives, the woman who tried to commit who's still getting scenes + backstory of her son who committed (so clearly she and/or he is important), Title being a psycho and of course Great and why tf he's seeing 4 minutes ahead - so many storylines to follow.

Already love the BiblexJes chemistry, I reckon it will grow more as the show progresses, just hope it's not a tragic ending.

Just for clarity, as we found out last week, Korn was cheating on this woman, who is his girlfriend/fiance with Tonkla, his sugar baby, last week.

Queen sammon.. üî•the plot is interesting

I think Dr. thyme was the one that hired hacker and also saved great... Either (he can look into the future or is investigating Great's fam for revenge i dont know)

So Korn is a two timing prick (has rich fianc√© connections üëçi think his character is eye catching cant wait for more) also Bas naked scene lmaoüòÇüòÇi saw his butt for 2 eps lol

Dome is the nice guy...i almost shipped titledome lol

Title is a violent person with murder tendencies (i think he'll harm great again?)

So it's official jjfaiz is back in this series i guess(i guess kongkla will cheat on Korn (vice versa)) and unites with His police lover... Also the first scene (did Kongkla kill someoneü§™... Did he kill his brother with rock or acting innocent) i need to rewatch this scene... I'm a little confused.. So kongkla is not so innocent huh? He smoked and killed his broüíÄ

Thymegreat are growing on me.. Thyme is a complex character i can't understand his intentions.. I'm loving this show... Boc never fails to awe me with a good bl thriller‚ù§‚Äçüî•‚ù§‚Äçüî•üî•

I think this series is going to be too gloomy and jarring for me.

I've noticed that as soon as a character acquires super powers, death and destruction follow them everywhere. Great seems to be strangely disconnected from life, and this new power of his is forcing him to step forward.

Thoughts about episode 2:

Title is the bad bad friend with bad influence who uses Great for clout and protection, because his family is either linked or more powerful. He also probably killed View and did something to Dome.

Ahahaha FUUUUUUUUUUCK

Muhahahah Tyme is so whipped for Great, who might accidentally have killed is trigger happy friend Title?

Ahahaha I repeat my FUUUUCK from earlier. So Tonkla and Title are brothers? Well shit.

Huh? So Mor Tyme was there to break up with his gf, right? But why was Title there? So somebody else coincidentally died on the same spot, whaaat? lol I‚Äôm so confused.

The curly haired woman in the casino is either a mole, a reporter or an undercover cop right?

Eeeh? How‚Äôs Mor Tyme involved in the casino business? wtf.

They made me love and hate Korn so quickly that I'm a mess. This show is absolute fire, y'all. I‚Äôm still frustrated that something with so much potential is only being shown in a few countries. Bible, Jes, and the rest of the cast deserve so much more, and this could have been something praised outside BL productions...

Guys I tried to post a pic of Bas's ass but it was deleted.

I am too stressed out to watch out of context incoherent BLs.

There's no sex in this ep? I might lose interest.

I mean it's Sammon/BOC, they're more plot focused... If you just want the NC scenes then you could probably just wait for spoilers and watch based on that because we probably won't get a ton. Like even KP only had... 4? and that was spread out across 12 episodes, and DFF had 3 iirc.

I'm just here for bible and the doc. Hopefully they both live, but if not just would like to see the full NC scene. :P I figure someone will put up a nice diagram once we get there to explain it all just like the horror one I never understood. :)

Two things, for one of which I'm going to be crucified:

My friend and I used to classify good looking men into three types: knitting pattern, shaving advert, and gay porn. Jes and Bible have completed their journey to arrive at the pinnacle of hotness.

At the risk of getting slaughtered, so far, guys, I don't think the show is very good. Great production values, yes, but it's all confusing as hell, and the writing is just awful. I'll still visit from time to time for the hot men, but, a masterclass in storytelling it ain't... Maybe things will change?

I'm going back to bed now. Bye.

How is it awful? The multiple timelines are being connected flawlessly they are providing clues every step of the way.

But yes it may require analyzing and rewatching and that kind of active watching I do understand is not for everyone.
