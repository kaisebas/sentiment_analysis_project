yeah, so Great heard Tyme's voice and basically imagined another version of everything working out differently. üò©

This was so sweet.

It also explains a bit why Tyme looked somewhat reluctant when they hooked up. I thought it was because he had intended to release that video, but it's because he was going to do that to someone he was actually fond of.

For the first 5 episodes every time you see great on screen (only him, this is important) you are actually following his memories of events since he had a cardiac arrest after being shot... The 4 minutes thing allows him to create an alternative reality, and change the events that happened in real life.. I guess it's his way of coping.. you have conformation of this with episode 6, which shows us the true events - reality.

Basically, each event that happened before Great goes back 4 minutes in those episodes is actually what happened (as you can see in ep 6), so he left the lady in the middle of the tunnel, he let his friend kill dome, he left the girl die, etc...

Now, why does great get shot? Starting all this? Because dome's brother tries to kill him and he gets a cardiac arrest and starts to see 4 minutes in the future, just like the lady explains to the other doctor that is doing research on near death experiences

Remember I mentioned that only when we see great we are following memories? Well, what we see for the other characters during all episodes is actually the reality. This is way one minute we see great saving dome and another his brother morning him...on great's memories/alternative reality he saved dome, but in reality he was killed

Hope that helps. Let me know if you have any questions

So, it‚Äôs as we expected -

The beginning of the eps have been showing us a scene from original (OG) timeline /reality

Eps 1-5 showed us Great‚Äôs alternate timeline of events after he flatlines where we learn he‚Äôs just a sappy romantic who dreams of awkward dates and awkwarder sex and pretends to be a virgin

Eps 6-7 we see OG timeline / reality in detail

End of 7 we see the beginning of Tyme‚Äôs alternate timeline at the moment he decides whether to read his mom‚Äôs diary

Killers:

Kla‚Äôs father killed the cat (as u/ThoughtsAllDay predicted)

Kla kills his father

Warit / Korn‚Äôs fianc√©e‚Äôs dad (KFD) killed Tyme‚Äôs parents

Great kills suicidal woman

Title kills Dome with Great as an accomplice

Gambling manager kills Mon, Nan‚Äôs friend

Gambling manager kills Nan

Kla kills Title

Kla shoots Great

Warit KFD kills Tyme‚Äôs grandma

Warit KFD shoots Tyme (or orders it)

Sammon killed my dreams, any remaining hope for a romance, and any chance for a hot GreatTyme nc scene

Mysteries Solved

The alternate tea ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Great‚Äù comes from something Tyme says to Great while Great is in a coma state (notably before he starts flatlining; so not DURING his ‚Äú4 Minutes‚Äù)

Tyme and Great met as kids, so Tyme knew Great used to be afraid of dogs

Unsolved Mysteries

Who is Lakwa and what does she have to do with Great?

Why does Great‚Äôs alternate timeline contain things he could not know (like things that happen when he‚Äôs not there) and is it just lazy writing?

Why am I still hoping for a satisfying ending?

But this time he read it with new eyes. This time he saw that his parents apologized. Cause they were actuallu the ones that caused this entire huge mess. He has also already read Doc Den's research so he will figure out he is within the 4 Min cycle way faster than Great did.

This show is so amazing. It‚Äôs beautifully, acted, produced, edited, and curated. It‚Äôs the first show I couldn‚Äôt wait for the next episode since Only Friends (and I ended up not finishing that one live). It has everything. My heart is in it. I care so much about the characters. It may not be perfect for some (just leaving leeway for others opinions not that I‚Äôve seen much differing ones) but it‚Äôs been such a perfect ride for me. I can‚Äôt wait for the last episode. Regardless how I think they stick the landing next week this has been such a fun and loving ride to watch week after week.

WOW so the final ep will cover Tyme's 4 minutes and we'll finally know if they were able to actually change anything. I feel like there were a few hints in this ep that it is indeed possible so they might have. Although they're both dead in this TL, I still hope both are alive in another one they were able to create together? üôèüò©

I bloody love Ton Kla though. Everything he does just hits right. Fuaiz is smashing it.

Killed his abusive dad for his beloved black cat.. great was shot by him in the elevator... And i guess Title was stoned to death exactly where his brother Dome was killed (that explains why the officers arrived at his house)

So all this 4 min thingy is just (their moments of life (4 mins delulu before clinging to life) just mins before death i guess..

But there's a plot hole i dont understand tho... (Previous ep) how did Great know that the lady he saved (accident in highway) was responsible for his mom's death??.. And who even is she ? (Unknown) She had a son too i hope they explain it in the last ep....??

Jes 4 mins starts from the Very beginning where he discovered his mom's diary... The first regret/mistake that led him to leak the evidence nd the messed up situation...

Tonkla is twisted murderer (mostly for revenge) so he is like harmless a bit with psychotic hallucinations...

Great's parents are bad but not too bad i guess(to be mega villains)

Also rip grandmaüòì(again i dont know if this is also real )

Rip greattymeüíÄ(i guess they showed us what led to the first scene) but I'm still clueless about what's happening.. Maybe last ep will give the answers.. I really hope they get saved tho?!

I actually hope this 4 mins is actual magic power of greattymeüíÄto alter their lives? Like second chance to correct all the wrongs?? And they'll magically just rewind to the beginning to avoid their demise? üíÄ

Since it's boc i just know they'll give this show an open ending (with two alternative theories) and call it a dayüíÄ.. Like Kp/dff..üò∂‚Äçüå´i think I'll be puzzled by the ending and end up being even more confused lolüòÇ

And poor Korn too forced to clean up his family's mess... On run finds his bro was shot......///tonkla üò∂

Villain reveal too!!..,

I still have some questions and I'm excited for the last ep

I also liked the fluffy flashback scenes the kids were too cute nd Job with his patient lover üòç‚ù§cute

Overall i think I'll give this show 9.5/10 i loooovvvveeee it... Sammon's writing is perfect... Cinematography/direction/acting wow chef's kiss... Kudos to the entire 4 min cast nd crew .. From colorist(that sets the tone) to intimacy coordinator/director/writer/editor they did a great job... I like how the scenes are compiled .. And also the storytelling (leaves viewers puzzled yet clarifies little by little).. I'm in awe wow...

This episode made me heartbroken for all the characters (and the cat) üò≠üíî For Tonkla, Great, Tyme....even Korn. Like, what could have been if the situations were different....The kids who played young GreatTyme did so well. I could totally picturize them as kid version of GT.

Baby Tyme and Great were so cute ü•∫ How does baby Great‚Äôs actor look like both Bible and Daou omg. He did so well in both series.

Someone made a parallel video on TikTok and when I tell you I am stuck in this moment üò© Adult TymeGreat/Baby TymeGreat parallel Like this is it, this is the show for me.

Not Great‚Äôs parents dipping first üíÄ Like they were concerned for him but not that concerned lol.

Anyways, not much from me this episode. I‚Äôm not expecting a happy ending but I am afraid it‚Äôs not going to stick the landing for me ü•≤ I will say it again, 8 episodes feels too short.

I rolled my eyes hard when they revealed the childhood connection. Sammon took the lazy way out again I guess because the relationship between Great/Tyme is still so underdeveloped so they are trying to force some connection and emotion but it doesn‚Äôt work for me. The most interesting thing about greattyme is   the 4 minutes concept.   

 I suspect Tonkla didn‚Äôt kill his cat all along. His actions are justified, he‚Äôs been totally wronged by the justice system and had to take matters into his own hands.

Voluntarily heisted by YinWar. Happily murdered by FirstKhao.
I am finally all caught up and ready to join theory shenanigans!

Forgive me for not reading through all the last 6 episodes on-airs (waaaaay too many comments), but believe me when I say I LIVED through the GIFs. (thanks to u/imomen - feeding us all üôè)

üí≠ THOUGHTS SO FAR:

I live for this timey-wimey-wibbly-wobbly sh*t. Thoroughly entertaining. The cinematography, the directing has all been on point.

Fuaiz is a revelation. And doing ALL the heavy lifting when it comes to the NC. Except for that time Win was heavy lifting Tonkla.

The chemistry between Tyme and Great in comparison (which is totally unfair cause Fuaiz is killing it) has been a little flat for me.

I know Tonkla is a murderer and probably unredeemable at this point, but I was so much more invested in his slow decent to madness. I thought that characterisation was so well played out. Moreso than Great fixing his regrets because we didn't really know him at that point. The "real" Great is now so much more interesting, and his actions make more sense now.

‚úçÔ∏è THEORY NOTES & PREDICTIONS

There are 2 main timelines, so far: (shoutout to Longjumping-Ad-6775 who did a great summary/theory with events from the multiple timelines)

"OG" where Tonkla's brother Dome is killed, he hooks up with Inspector Win and he goes on a revenge mission murdering Tle and shooting Great.

"4 minutes" where Great is able to reverse Dome's death, but also women in the tunnel - who goes on a revenge mission and hires someone who eventually shoots Great. I know there are offshoots from this timeline too, every time he changes the future, but let's keep it simple (because my old brain can't process it all).

We've seen flashes of a timeline where the Apology Thai Tea had a different message. So there's at least one scene that possibly belongs to a third timeline. Possibly this "third" timeline is the final one where somehow they make it all right and everyone has a happy ending... RIGHT?!

How does the female patient who also claims to be able to see 4 minutes into the future fit into the story? I think maybe we will see more of her this episode. Or she could just be in Great's head.

Even though there isn't a reason for them to meet in the alternate "4 minutes" timeline, I hope we see Tonkla and Win crossing paths anyway. Because fate.

Episode 7 thoughts...

Yes! Tonkla's villain arc has come full circle and -- to echo Thoughts comment -- he should have been the lead character. Though I admit it makes it more surprising that we didn't know the seemingly innocent side character was the villain of the story until later.

So we do see the female patient again, and Tyme looks through Doctor friend's research. He's going to learn a way to trigger the "4 minutes" phenomenon, possibly in himself.

Little Great IS SO FREAKING CUTE! The feeding of snacks to Little Tyme?! The hiding from a tiny dog. Adorbs. I believe he's the same child actor from Century of Love (and he was great in that too).

So Tyme knew who Great was all along. More than the fact he was his enemies son, but that he knew Great was afraid of dogs because they met as kids.

I had a theory that the repeating 11:00 motif was time of death - and this episode showed it! 11:04 would be the time both Great and Tyme wake up from temporary death. I'm not confident 1 more episode is enough to wrap up everyone's stories, let alone give us a happy ending. I have NO IDEA how they'll give us a satisfying ending. Will people get their justice? Will anyone have a happy ending? Or will we get an open-ended ending, and Tyme and Great are forever stuck in this loop where they are undoing their regrets over and over again...

I‚Äôm a bit disappointed that we got so little of TymeGreat this episode, especially because I started watching this show because of Bible. However I could even accept them dying in the end if that is necessary for a good storytelling. Sorry for my grammar, English isn‚Äôt my first language.

Fuaiz deserves all the praise this series. When Ton kla discovered that Great was Korn's brother and then did that smirk, brilliant! He realised Great and Title were in powerful positions and going to get away with it all.

I'm curious if Great and Tyme are in seperate realities or can they meet each other. Just like Lukwa saw Great in the 4 minutes room.

All I hope for in the end is that Ton Kla living somewhere safe with lots of cats.

It was a great smirk however I find it odd that in 8 years he never realized who Great is. I mean I am sure Kla stalks Korn's Insta and that photo was on his Insta and tagged ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so in 8 years he never figured out who Korn's brother was??

 4 Minutes
That was basically exactly what I thought it all was. I honestly feel like this has been clear once the 4 minutes thing was explained. So now we just wait to see if it goes more supernatural and Tyme and Great are able to live in another ‚Äútimeline‚Äù. The only thing I‚Äôve been unclear about is the lady who met Great and also saw 4 minutes. She said today she felt she‚Äôd be stuck in her 4-minutes world forever if her (ex)boyfriend‚Äôs voice hadn‚Äôt brought her back‚Ä¶maybe alluding to this other ‚Äútimeline‚Äù where Tyme and Great will get stuck (but in a happier world). But then what was that scene where she met Great with that weird voice about the brain and 4 minutes. Them actually meeting each other implies another world or timeline to me, going with that theory, over just purgatory or death.

And I still have to say, I do not see the JJFuaiz thing at all. BasFuaiz‚Ä¶smoking. JJ‚Äôs character was a total doofus in this so maybe that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶and he was an a-hole in DFF. And I can‚Äôt get past the porn-stache.

Fuck Sammon....visually love this series, the cinematography is to die for. Everything is so intentionally done, with meaning right down to the framing I love aystemetical framing, and the dutch tilts in the series are so well done.

BUT

Fuck Sammon and her bullshit, unoriginal writing. She had a chance here to do something original, something different, but no....we need recycled plots form Triage, and MOD. I knew I shouldn't have got so invested in the plotline, but I was naive, I had hope we were going to do something different. I mean it did't have to be completely revolutionary but at least something with a twist. Anything to keep the viewer guessing to the end.

Finale better be unhinged, but this episode, aside from the beautiful visuals, was a slap in the face.

So far it is airing next week in addition to it being shown this coming Monday in Person plus on Friday also in person AND on Viu/Gaga/iQiyi.

Idol Factory usually delays the YouTube release when they do an in person theatre finale. But BoC doesn't delay.

Secret Crush On You

Well here is my last attempt. I think at this point we have two options. The first is fairly straightforward. The apocalypse scenario where either one or both of them wake up after being shot but experiencing the 4 minute loops. If it both more than likely Great will wake up first and then go and talk to Thyme so he can hear Great‚Äôs voice in his coma and ‚Äúwake up‚Äù like the woman said happened to her.

Thyme in his 4 minute loops will put the diary back and never get involved with the casino. He will either never start dating the girl or break up with. He will meet Great and ‚Äúremember‚Äù the time they had together as kids and fall in love. When they both wakeup Life around them is unchanged and their lives are basically screwed up but hey, at least they now have a bond together after witnessing the 4 minute flashback loops and are in love o_O

Everybody is either dead or on the run in this option so I‚Äôm not sure what you have left for them expect they are together.

Kla will go on to kill Korn. Korn disappeared when he went rushing in he found out his brother was shot. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Kla lures him in there and takes care of the last detail in his revenge.

The next one is where we get a supernatural element going on that when the two of them wake up it is an altered timeline. Thyme is starting out where he gets the diary. It is fairly obvious that the first flashback will lead him to putting the diary back. In the end his need for revenge was a wasted effort. It leads to the death of the person he really loves his grandma and his mother had a hand in her own death by running a business that brutalized people like Nan.

That is all Thyme has to do to fix his past. I‚Äôm not sure about the girlfriend. If they were dating before or after the diary. From the sounds of it he was using her as a replacement for him for his grandma if something happened to him. It is a good possibility she is no longer ‚Äúneeded‚Äù his life if he isn‚Äôt out for revenge.

I‚Äôm fairly sure that we will now be in Great‚Äôs altered timeline. They will bump into each other at the hospital but this time Thyme will take notice of Great as well just as a hot guy. We will get a few moments where Thyme backs away from Great but 4 minute loops so they get close. They fall in love. Since neither one of them is involved in the casino or exposing it neither one will get shot. When they both wake up it will mostly likely be in bed together instead of a hospital. There is a chance the casino does get exposed by someone else and Great does get shot if so he will wake up to have Thyme at his side as a boyfriend..

Since we are on the altered timeline the walking diaster area of Kla‚Äôs life won‚Äôt have happened but I still suspect that things aren‚Äôt going to end well there. Kla desperate need for raw sex from Korn most likely is coming from the fact they started their relationship without condoms and now Korn is using them. Kla has to realize at this point that Korn is sleeping with someone else. He wasn‚Äôt Korn‚Äôs boy toy at the start. Korn was helping him get away from his dad, and they were in love. Korn PROMISED he would come out after college and they would be together. Their college days are LONG gone and he is still lying in front of Kla and now sleeping with others. Kla has been fooling himself but in episode1 you could see it wasn‚Äôt working anymore.

With the altered timelines Korn has no reason to change thing. The girl doesn‚Äôt have leverage to force him into marriage and he is clueless about Kla‚Äôs potential for murder. But just because Dome isn‚Äôt dead doesn‚Äôt mean that Kla is going to let things stay that way. In episode 7 we see the black cat run across the gun when Kla realizes that Great was helped kill Dome and he is Korn‚Äôs brother. We also seen that black cat in episode 1. Korn stops sex to answer a phone call, lies and says he is with his girlfriend right in front of Kla, and then runs out the door to go to dinner with his dad. Every single thing there is something horrible to do in front of your boyfriend.

I‚Äôm fairly sure the black cat is a harbinger of death in Kla‚Äôs mind. It was impetus for him to kill his dad. It was there when he decided to kill Great. If Dome hadn‚Äôt died I‚Äôm fairly sure that Kla would have ended up killing Korn for being a terrible boyfriend.

As for the casino and everything tied to it I have no clue. This last episode showed us it is the fiance‚Äôs dad that actually is the terrible bad guy in all this. While the episode itself felt like a retread of stuff that was easy to assume it did gives small details to shade in the story. Surprisingly Great‚Äôs dad isn‚Äôt as much of an asshole as we thought. Mom‚Äôs ruled the day as villains in this story. It was Great‚Äôs MOM that actually started the business down the black path of illegal crap. It was also Thyme‚Äôs MOM that brought the northern casinos and bootstrapped Great‚Äôs dad‚Äôs business into the casino business. Great‚Äôs dad actually didn‚Äôt want Thyme‚Äôs parents killed at all.

Of course it is the fiance‚Äôs dad that is ultimate bad guy. He killed Thyme‚Äôs parents and seems to be the driving forced behind the casinos. I suspect there will be some kind of way that he ends up dead or in jail by the end of the show but I don‚Äôt know where it will happen.

With there being only 1 more episode what ever they do it isn‚Äôt going to feel satisfying. This last episode was a wasted episode. It added minor details but it didn‚Äôt do a great deal to expand on the 4 minute loop or even add big details to the story going around. Right now Great and Thyme feel more like broken strangers. 1 more episode isn‚Äôt going to change that. Any ending with them together isn‚Äôt going to leave a believable ending. Have one or both died would feel like why did we even bother. They also have to deal with the casino aspect which once again will feel shallow because the amount of time they can devote to it. Kla and Korn need a tie up as well. At this point they only have a single episode to tie up stuff and they haven‚Äôt come close to doing that yet.

To be honest the most fascinating story in this show has been Kla‚Äôs. They needed to get rid of all this supernatural junk and made this a murder love story and this would have been an amazing show.

Kla is the STAR. I don't understand why they have Jes Bible doing all the press when they are just side characters we know nothing about by ep7 while we know EVERYTHING about Kla and have seen more of his story and more screentime with him than with JesBible

Yes make Kla kill everyone and then stay with Win in a one sided love. Win loves him. Kla uses him. Forever. Win is the closest we have to "love" in this alleged "Boyslove" story.

I love your theories. My guess is anything you wrote, even most boring case scenario, will be more satisfying than what we see next week.

I think one thing still missing for me ‚Äî and I wonder what you think ‚Äî is what the heck this Lakwa thing is all about. The fact that we see her and Great in the ‚Äú4 Minutes‚Äù room is never explained. It HAS to mean something or it‚Äôs just bad writing.

As for Fuaiz/Kla, I didn‚Äôt watch Strong Girl Namsoon but I followed the hype around it, which was all about Byeon Woo Seok, who played the villain. No one really supported the actual main couple and certainly not the ML, played by Ong Seong Woo. At the end of the day, people watched for BWS and he WAS the main character.

That‚Äôs exactly what 4M reminds me of. I don‚Äôt know if it was intentional, but the most compelling actor and character is Fuaiz playing Kla. I‚Äôm left wondering if Pond and Sammon knew that ‚Äî especially as they focused so much of the NCs on Fuaiz? Or are they that clueless? There‚Äôs such a disconnect between the marketing of this series and its content.

This is not a romance and JesBible don‚Äôt have scorching chemistry. This is a psychological thriller with a complex villain as the lead. Are the creators not aware of what they made? I genuinely want to ask them if they‚Äôre aware of this disconnect and why they‚Äôre trying to market any of it as ‚Äúsultry‚Äù. IMO, they look like fools.

if jes doesn't survive, bible ain't surviving either.. and we may get the last scene with two of them on canoe and time 11.04..

ELSE, someone has to ensure Jess reaches hospital too

Good thing is , he is shot in abdomen both times.. and not in chest/heart... so maybe is meant to survive

Jess has read the 4 minutes research.. so that should help him to regain consciousness from his dream world... we already saw that bible regained it with his eyelids shaking when Jess was talking to him

The open mystery - Why did lookwa see Bible in that 4 min room... do jess and bible also meet

Voluntarily heisted by YinWar. Happily murdered by FirstKhao.
Thinking about this more. The "suicide lady" is what really kicks off the sequence of events. It's because of that event that Great starts to really shutdown his compassion, letting Dome and Nan die etc. For such an important character we don't know a lot about her (unless I missed it?). Why did her son die, and why did she blame Great's family for it? Was he just some random worker in their gambling operation, or is there more to it?

If she wasn't so important, I think the story could have started with Dome's death and there wouldn't be much change to the story. Another vengeful family member (maybe related to Nan or Mon) could have hired the hitman to shoot at Great/his mum and that still would have made sense.

Updated PREDICTIONS / How I think it should end

In the scenario that the entire OG and Great's alternate timeline is retconned, something would have to change before this event so that the suicide lady doesn't try to kill herself with Great's car. Maybe Tyme's alternate timeline will correct this, and he stops his parents from helping set up this gambling operation in the first place, and they both "live" in this HEA timeline (but in reality/OG, both are dead).

OR. We see Tyme attempt to correct the timeline in his "4 minutes" alternate reality, but isn't able to change much. For some reason I keep thinking about the Thai Milk Tea that he gives Great. How did he know Great likes that drink? He said he asked around but what random person is going to reveal something so specific and to a total stranger? Suss. Perhaps some of the moments we've already seen were from Tyme's perspective already? I think the only thing Tyme will be able to change for the better is Great's demise, but Tyme dies - which is why we don't see him in the 4 minutes room with Lukwa and Great.

Gosh my head hurts too much for a Saturday morning. I don't know how y'all did this for weeks....

I also had the theory once (cause I feel like they change every 4 minutes lol), that they are in that room right before waking up, like a waiting room for being released from the hospital. So what you say totally makes sense! Tyme "rescuing Great but dying in the process, I could see that unfortunately üò™

It‚Äôs the child actor from Century of Love ‚ù§Ô∏è!!! So nice to see him again and his acting is superb as always. Also, I‚Äôm amazed by JJay‚Äôs height every time I see him. It‚Äôs so funny when the other cops look like teenage girls beside him üòÇ Plus, I love how consistent Tonkla‚Äôs character is. He didn‚Äôt turn bad bc of Dome‚Äôs death. It‚Äôs always been who he is. I can sort of understand why he took matters into his own hands now. Only one episode left and gosh am I stressed. I can‚Äôt imagine how this is going to end. Is this one of the series where all good people have their lives ruined while the bad guys escaped scot free? Dang ü•≤

I keep wondering if Kla killed anyone else between the dad and these killings now ü§î

I'm also sure someone killed Korn's mom, very likely Korn's fiance's dad.

Ok, I watched again, this time with good subtitles:

I can understand Ton Kla perfectly. The police system is corrupt and the only decent policeman is completely useless (He got the USB at night and did he really have no time in sending the video to his phone or email? Really? Damn Win. The only thing you are good at is fu**ing).
He did the right thing killing his father( an abuser), Title (a psycopath) and Great (even if we like him, he is rotten and got his empathy when he was shot).
Ton Kla's look when he saw Great and Korn's picture is revealing. I wonder if he will kill Korn too for thinking he is covering for Great.

Tyme what a naive fool you are, did you really think that someone who killed your parents would let your grandma and you live? Going to Great's dad to show him porn was beyond stupid.
Warit is the devil incarnate and unless someone kills him drectly he won't be touched by law (if police covered for a brat, son of a policeman, imagine what they would do to cover for a mob boss).

I wonder if Tyme and Great will find each other in the limbo and will wake up, or will die together.
I know it's practically impossible but I would like to see what happens with Ton Kla, Korn and Win.
Will Korn kill Win to protect Ton Kla? Will Ton Kla kill Korn for being Great's brother?
I think Ton Kla will die like New did in DFF after taking his revenge.

I think it's impossible wrap this thing up in just one episode, but after thinking a while, I want to have faith.

Late to the party this week because I work everyday (ew) and I am so tired.

Wow literally everyone in this show is a piece of shit except the Inspector and Dome. Ton Kla will kill Title - which is what we saw him do in an earlier episode. And then go for Great - he'll work out Great was involved somehow.

The inspector is a bit shit tbh. He's too pure for the world he's in. Ton Kla's brain has been damaged from the abuse of his Father and meth, he's 100% a Psychopath. Does Ton Kla know Great is Korn's brother? I'm still not even sure Ton Kla and Korn are together in the real timeline. Oh so he does know they're brothers. This is running commentary as I watch.

Nooooooo the Psychopathic smile.

Honestly I don't even know who's side i'm on here. I don't like any of these people anymore. DR DEN ok. I only like this guy.

I wonder who's voice will snap Great out of it HMMMMMMMM. Or maybe he'll just die on the table. Does Thyme actually care about Great? Time and decisions. Lobe how Sammon always has some deeper moral in her stories. Feels like she's strayed from the happy endings since the days of Manner of Death and Triage though.

OH MY FUCKING GOD shooting his Grandma over facetime is fucking depressing.

I'm ready for 4 Minuteception. Who's memories are we in today?! üòÇüòÇüíÄü´†

Korn's Mum couldn't help and you want to sign the divorce papers OOOOOOOFT there's tea there.

Oh so Thyme's parents were shitheads too? AND HE KNEW GREAT AS A KID. Aw baby Great feeding little Thyme.

Man swirling a glass of red wine and smiling about murder. Always a Psychopath ‚úÖ Who is Warit? Have we seen him before? OMFG FIND THE BOOK TYHME. That's gonna have so many answers.

Oh this scene is familiar.

Fuck i'm so stressed. Is Great now dead?

Is Thyme gonna have his 4 minutes now? Is this him just recreating a memory where he FINDS the book and somehow that holds all the answers for him? So in reality he clearly left the diary behind, and in his little 4 minute trance he'll read it and it'll provide all his answers (which won't even be real).

I see no way this show has a happy end. How the hell are they gonna wrap this up in one episode?

That journal is what Thyme read and that is when he started his revenge mission. In his revised memories now, he is contemplating not reading the journal or reading it more accurately - last time he didn't get the part where his mom wrote she was sorry to him - because this entire mess is actually Thyme's parents fault cause they were the gambling den OGs. Also that note from the mom is similar to the note on the coffee cup that kept changing with Great. When Thyme apologized while Great was unconscious that might be why Great saw the cup message changing.

Warit is Korn's Fiance's Dad and very friendly with Great's mom (I think Great's mom asked Warit to kill Korn's mom tbh). Yes, we have seen him several times. Korn's fiance always tells Korn that her dad can "fix things" and Korn's dad keeps saying that Warit is the cleaner upper in the family. This is why Korn can never leave his fiance.

Once it's over, a binge rewatch is a must, knowing what everything means, will likely allow us to see more things in earlier episodes that we must have missed.

Great's dad's shipping/logistics business was going under, it needed money fast to survive. He went to his mistress, Great's mom, the scene where baby Great and his mom were playing, and the dad walked in and told her (his mistress) that his wife (Korn's mom) was unable to help him with his business. So his mistress, Great's Mom, told him she might be able to help him. She said that she knew some investors that could help get him money fast. She introduced him to Thyme's parents. Thyme's parents were successful owners of Gambling Dens. Like the one grown up Thyme hates that Great's dad runs now. So Thyme's parents are the ones that introduced Great's parents into the Gambling Den business. Thyme wrongfully assumed his parents were poor and were working FOR Great's dad to earn whatever money they could to feed their family. But his parents were actually rich. Tyme didn't realize this cause he was little and lived with his grandma who was poor. Thyme's mom dropped him off at Grandma's cause their business was dangerous and they were being hunted much like Great's parents are fleeing from now.

After this episode, I actually have hope for the finale.

The woman from the study says "I've been thinking about how I came out of seeing 4 minutes in the future. Because if I didn't come to my senses, I would've been stuck there forever. And in the real world, I would probably be dead "

And then when Tyme regrets his actions and says it will haunt him till the day he dies, dr Den answers "but sometimes, we might have a chance, to resolve any lingering feelings" , suggesting that there is a way to change things.

For me, it means that it's not just a dream/fantasy, there are indeed alternate realities and they can choose which one they stay in... but it might also mean dying in the others ones.

If Great died in the reality (having heart attack) + in his 4 minutes one (being shot), maybe it's to live in Tyme 4 minutes reality, where everything can still be fixed?

The animal cruelty at the beginning caught me off guard, I wasn‚Äôt ready for it. It‚Äôs the one thing that I absolutely cannot stand and sends me into a state of panic immediately. The thought of someone doing that to a defenceless little creature? Takes a fucked up person with a power trip. I went to lovingly pet my cat straightaway.

This show is testing my patience and my sanity.

I was up till 5 this morning, trying to figure out what will happen next week.

There are so many possiblities left, that I can't predict exactly what will happen.

First of all, Dr. Den leaves Tyme with his scientific study, insisting that he should read it. And that is a reaction to the immense regret Tyme has after having seen Great, in a coma of a sort, in the hospital. And that he will regret his decisions untill the day he dies.

And Den is like, well, what if you can do your decisions once again, but than differently?

If that is really the case, this show has a phantasy element. And I am not buying that completely. I think that it is more realistic. Cause the events can not change like in Sammons earlier work, Triage. Or it can? Why should Den be so insisting that Tyme reads it? Because if you can not change it, that will means that Tyme is, like Great, only imagining things in his head in the cardiac arrest phase?

So, i am stuck with that. And also, if certain decisions of Tyme can be changed, will that affect Great? Cause he was shot, not because of that, but in relation to Dome and Tonkla, and Tyme was not even aware of that.

And everything Lukwa is saying, that she would have been stuck in her 4 minutes into the future thing, if she was not called out of it by her then boyfriend.

What with the note on the tea in a earlier episode, that Tyme wrote, Forgive me Great? Will that play a role next week?

I get a headache just thinking about all the possiblities.

And last night, i thought, well, for Tonkla and Win, i don't see a future. In fact, i think that Tonkla will die. Leaving Win heartbroken.

But for Great and Tyme, i saw possiblities.

But now? No. I think that one of those two, dies or stay forever in a coma.

I just have to wait for next week.

DFF left us with a ending that was much the subject of debate, and that everyone could interpret as whatever they wanted. It is possible that 4 minutes is leaving us with a outcome of that sort.

The whole cast is excellent. Bas as Korn was a pleasant surprise. But Fuaisz, i still can not get over it, how he plays this role and he is still that young. Incredibly talented.

He told him to read his research because he wanted him to read the part the girl told Dr. Den about the voice of her boyfriend pulling her out of the 4min loop. Since Thyme hasn't explicitly told Den that Great is his boyfriend, Den was being cautious and not outright telling Thyme HEY GO TALK TO YOUR BOYFRIEND CAUSE IT MAY PULL HIM OUT OF THIS.

That's why after Thyme read it, he went to talk to Great. And Great heard his voice and that is what triggered the revised prettier version of events in Great's mind. Which is what we saw in previous episodes.
