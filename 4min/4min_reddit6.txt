The way he just casually ‘Sup bro’-ed his dad when they were just beefing. Dad was like ‘I’m not your bro’ with that paper toss lol.

It is such a weird setup.

Nobody can reach the center of the table. The cleaning staff probably dusts it using a Swiffer to reach the center.

Marble is a terrible material for dining tables. It is easily scratched and very porous. The porous nature makes it soak up stains like a sponge. The process for removing stains from marble is quite involved. You need to make a poultice mixture that has both liquid and solid components. The liquid component penetrates the marble to dissolve the stain. The solid component needs to be more absorbent than the marble to draw everything back out.

BoC's Cinematography
omg I fucking LOVE this. Soooo so so many people say "I would NEVER do that in this situation" and think they would be a big hero in whatever tragedy they read about in the news. But they never would be. Great was seeing visions of himself as being a good person, but we see that he wasn't. He's a murderer and an accomplice to a second murderer. Everyone wants to be the hero in their own story, and will lie to themselves about it. Wow, Great is such a grey, complex character.

Okay, so... why does Jet look so hot splattered in blood? Title's a fucking dick, but still... heyyyyyy

Jes and Bible's ass curves could crumble empires. Jesus.

I love that Great was turned on that Tyme was trying to fuck over his father.

"You let someone die because of your cowardice." Correction, Great let 3 people die because of his cowardice.

Okay, so what was Korn doing when Tyme was first spying on him? He definitely was doing something that involved bloodshed.

Through the whole episode, I was wondering how Tongkla's story was going to fit into this. DAMN.

MANNNNNNNNNNN, now I need to go back and watch all the other episodes because this gives new context to everything. It's just like DFF all over again. How is Mr. Ascot going to fit into this??

I can't get over this moment, wasn't Tyme low-key hating Great? I get the angry focking with purpose, but this was anything but.. and no one can convince me of the opposite! Like did he have to hold his face oh so gently and go into that kiss so passionately as if Great's mouth holds all the answers to all of his questions? World-shattering SIGH...😩

i think it all just comes down to Tyme likes pretty things. And regardless of how he feels underneath it all or his ulterior motives, he can appreciate that Great is so pretty and in a different lifetime Tyme would be so down. 😩

What I loved was this episode makes the TymeGreat NC scene in ep 4 make more sense and is even sweeter now. Great clearly fell hard for Tyme, and in his little purgatory existence, he imagined that precious, awkward tent moment as their first time instead of what really happened (drunk after a bar more feral sex). Great is actually a puppy at heart but we also get to see the real him in ep 6. I LOVE Sammon, this is so true to how complex humans actually are and how we view ourselves vs. reality.

I didn’t love KinnPorsche (sorry folks) so I wasn’t into Bible, but I love him with Jes. I can feel Sammon all over this, too, it reminds me so much of Manner of Death, which is a fave of mine. Jes reminds me of Tul.

Anywho, excuse me while I go rewatch minutes 15-23 again. Even taking out the NC scenes, I’m really enjoying this show.

I felt kinda sad at the end of this episode. I kinda liked nice Great who isn’t real, then it also pretty much confirms that none of the characters are going to get a happy ending.

Edit- And Tyme and Great’s relationship! I liked the fake time line much better 😢

OMG just great episode, I love this side of Great but can we all agree that he's clearly depressed and only acts like that because he wants attention ? ( remember the scene when he was talking about how unhappy he is and the meds he takes) and whatever happens (in real life or his reminiscence during his heart attack) Great got shot anyway XD
Such a great episode !! Now we're finally arriving in the present to see what is happening for the first scene of episode 1!!!!
Like the few last time I tried to create a diagram with the main event, I hope it will help someone!

I loved this messed up version of Great. When he drove away from a hit and run we knew he wasn't a good guy but I still didn't expect this side of him. I'm sad the nc scene wasn't continuous (gotta get that Durex ad in) and by lack of Fuaiz again. I did think it was Great re-living memories but changing things. I'm just wondering if Tyme is also is this limbo place with Great, so their cute dates did happen but not in the real world or is it all in Great's imagination? There's a scene when Tyme gives Great a coffee cup but the message changes on it to 'I'm sorry Great' so my thoughts are that they are both in this limbo place.

I guess next week we will see what happened to Tyme, would Tonkla have a reason to hunt him down? Is Win protecting Tonkla do we think? Things still have to go down between Korn and Tonkla too. It's torture waiting another week 😭😅

Well well well. I am at the point that I have just decided to trust that I will I understand it by the end and I’m officially going to stop trying to work it out.

Great episode, great NC, cutie pie moments that were a good contrast and a compelling mystery. I think it is the best show on air at the moment, certainly one of the best of this genre.

Genuine question here - are the nc scenes actually worth watching in terms of 'adding to characterization and/or plot'? I don't particularly find nc scenes all that interesting if there are no feelings involved, so I skipped them as soon as I realized Tyme's motivations.

I'm really curious to see the fandom's reaction to Tyme's action with the video because the reaction in DFF was... intense, to say the least. Great's reaction also made me so sad because it shows how little he values himself. The sexual promiscuity, the drinking, basically going along with whatever happens around him - this is a boy who doesn't really care what happens to him.

Ngl, after both DFF and now 4 Minutes I am kind of glad that BOC is going to do a sitcom because they appear to have developed an allergy to having any real romance or love in their bl. I have an appreciation for real life themes but I also don't mind some actual romance and love, y'know? The prior episodes were sweet but knowing it was all fake kind of ruins it and strips their meaning away.

Realizing that Tyme most likely hates Great was a stark contrast in comparison to Great's fantasy of the last few episodes. Not only has he been making himself a better person, he's been imagining a world where Tyme was actually interested in him and liked him, which kind of makes it extra tragic.

At this point I am mostly interested to see what happens from here. There must be flashbacks from Tyme, I am guessing? So I am curious to see what he will change. Perhaps he regrets the video? I hope so, as remorse should really be depicted with that heavy of a topic.

I will say, though - I do like that they made Tyme absolutely terrible as well. Like he goes after Great for the sole reason of creating revenge porn, and then turns his back on safety for his grandmother for the sake of his quest for revenge - but judges Great for his very human response to danger. Great's no innocent himself but Tyme's got himself on a white horse he deserves to be knocked down off of.

Now to see how this all wraps up in the next two episodes. At this point I am kind of assuming that Tonkla, Korn, Great and Tyme all die, but I'm side eyeing BOC for their promo picture for the final episode, lol.

I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that Great isn't inherently evil. Troubled, yes. It's a direct result of his family dynamics. He goes along with what's he's told to do because he's to afraid to rock the boat. When he meets Tyme, he's finally able to start taking a stand.

so, as expected w/ Sammon's writing: everything is explained in a "real world" way. Seems like no timelines, no powers, etc. Just Great (and Tyme?) experiencing "near death" and in his mind wanting to go back and "make things right" etc.

Sammon & P'Pond CACKLING rn. lol

Oh God. I LOVED THIS EPISODE. The best one
Great, what a brat bastard coward you are.
This time his claims to his father about killing people are very hypocritical considering he killed that woman, helped to kill Dome and did nothing to help Nan.

The poor man felt so bad about disappointing Tyme that he dreamt about fixing his mistakes and being a good person, but too late.
Probably a lot of people will be swearing at TonKla, but he did what he had to do, Title and Great got rid of his brother like trash so they deserved the same fate.

It's just the 6th episode so I wonder how things will continue now. Will the series take into account the timeline Great created in his mind or it will be just forgotten?

Full agree 💯

I am TEAM TONKLA. Kill em all Kla. I support you 🫰🏻

But also bratty Great was HOT AF 🔥 and in another parallel universe I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want the Tyme that grabbed Great by the hand and dragged him away from the Aunties that were making the food when Great got picky/bratty and disciplining him.

This show has an interesting concept but unfortunately the romance between Great and Tyme is the weakest part (imo) this is an issue that I have with Sammon shows overall. She doesn’t write compelling romances. The thriller/mystery and some characters are the strongest aspect of her stories.

Correct. Sammon's work never makes the romance the plot. It isn't central. It's just kinda thrown in there with some hotness. But desire and want and passion stemming from actual Romance is never central or important in her stories. So we knew going in that it is unlikely that we would get happy romantic vibes.

Just because romance isn’t the plot doesn’t mean you can’t still incorporate a compelling romance. It’s interesting that BOC did Kinnporsche which did have a more compelling central romance but the mafia concept was underwritten (imo). They are doing interesting productions but need to find a balance.

Here is my contribution. I'm ashamed that I haven't read through the epicly long thread. But here is my super long contribution.

Ok think I have two different theories about what is going on. I’m not sure which I’m leaning toward more and I know I missing something but here we go. Anything is italic is my guesses.

Three Timeline theory

For this one, there are three different timelines OG, Great, and Thyme. Great and Thyme both get a chance to fix their past and then their combined efforts will be able to give everyone a HEA.

Original Timeline

This is the timeline that Kla, Korn, and Win’s story is taking place in. It is the opening for each episode including the first one.

Title kills Dome and Great helps reluctantly. Great’s help is caught on the dashboard cam of Titles car.

Win gets pulled into Kla and the injustice of his brother’s death is being kicked under the carpet. He agrees to move in with Kla for “protection” while Kla kicks Korn to the curb for being a shitty boyfriend.

Kla drugs Title, puts him in Title’s car just like Dome,* and kills him. He also watches the car’s dash cam and finds out about Great.

Win finds out about Kla and tips him off he is about to be arrested. ( Win might have found out before moving in, but I don’t think he could have hidden the evidence for that long)

Kla flees and goes and shoots Great.

Kla or Win kills Korn (more on this down below)

We get to see the rundown of this in episode 6 but here are a few things that will be important later on in both theories.

In this timeline, Thyme and Great aren’t that close. Thyme is using Great and although there are moments with Tyme where there is something more. He hesitates to upload the video it takes looking at his mom’s picture to push him into do that. He also didn't try to use Great again but pushed him firmly away. There is something there perhaps in “another life” type of thing but no way can anything happen in this time line. Despite this they part on very bad terms. I do believe Thyme was also transferring a great deal of his own guilt at Nan’s death to Great and Great’s words were said because he was mad at Thyme’s accusations that he knew were true. Neither one of them wanted to face the part they played in her death

In this timeline Nan dies. She has already passed a flashdrive to Thyme but she was captured trying to steal info about the investors in the casino. They were on her phone uploaded somewhere but Thyme doesn’t have them. If he had access to her cloud there would be no reason to sneak out to give him flashdrives. He only has what she has already given him so it won’t be a complete list of all the people involved in the casino. There will be some still able to help Great's dad cover things up like the “General” that is holding the cops off so they can clear the warehouse.

We don’t get to see what happens to Thyme after they part. But all the opening episodes have been in the OG timeline so the first one where Thyme is shot would be included.

The rest is my guesses on what happens after they part. Thyme goes back to the warehouse. Maybe it is to retrieve Nan’s body. Maybe Korn, wanting to get rid of Thyme for screwing with his brother and trying to expose his family, tricks Thyme into a meeting at the warehouse.

Korn stabs Thyme hoping to kill him but is interrupted by Kla. Kla is ready to kill Korn. Great killed his brother, Korn has been a spectacularly shitty boyfriend and murder seems to be rather fun right now. Thyme escapes wounded.

It also could be Kla’s part doesn’t go down in the warehouse but Korn finds out about Kla’s murder spree and confronts him. Win shots Korn to protect Kla. Either way I suspect Win will be a party to this killing. If that happens it could be a random goon stabbing Thyme.

This is were we meet up with episode 1. The guy that shoots Thyme isn’t going to be one of Korn’s men. He is a hitman that is hired at the temple to kill Great in Great’s timeline. In the OG timeline I suspect he has been hired by Nan’s pregnant friend to kill Tyme for getting Nan involved in HIS revenge and getting her killed.

And now that I'm a little bit less confused, does this mean that it doesn't really matter the timeline Great is going to end up shot and probably dead?

I love how much of a brat Great is. The look of disbelief he had when Tyme said we cannot see each other again. He was genuinely confused to be rejected. The way he was looking all over, like thinking, can u believe this guy? He said no to me and my bubbly ass.Comment Image immediately he called his brother, the one person he knew will never reject him. He and Ming in MSI are typical rich brats. They might not outright go to hurt a person, but they won't help anyone also. Like how Great tried to stop Title from killing Dome but did not give much care about it altogether. They are made more trouble due to their ever supporting elder brothers. The kind of brothers who will only ask are u hurt if the younger call them to say they killed someone. Then they meet someone who will say no to them for the first time in their whole life. Now they are done and can't leave the other person ever. How Great wants to change for Tyme and wished their first meeting to be romanticComment Image I'm sure if ming had his 4 minutes he wud wish for the same with Joe. All in all, loving all our cute brats

I guess it's true, birds of a feather and all that....

I found it odd he was friends with a red flag like Title. That should have been a clue. Seems like the whole family might be rotten 🤷🏿‍♀️. To the core?? That has not been established yet.

Seeing Korn wiping his bloody hands today, made it clear he is more hands on and doesn't leave everything to his henchmen like I originally thought 😭😭

Actually why in the world is Great so into Tyme they hooked up one time where Tyme secretly filmed a sex tape to fuck up Greats family and Great was just "let's do that again"?? But this episode got me seriously stressed honestly they need to make these like kdramas and have 70 minute episodes because 45 to 50 minutes are definitely not enough. Also I'm seriously missing WinTonkla we haven't seen them interact properly in like 2 episodes

Yeah, it actually made me so sad for Great that he seemingly has such little self-respect or self-care that he just... doesn't care, and even goes after Tyme again? He is so messed up.

Wow .. Greattyme 👀im shocked... Fourhub(lmao for 4 mins 😂 lol) nd only fans lmao...

But this show is genius.. Timetravel(4 mins future thingy) is done right... They gave us a whole ep about what'll happen without 4 min ability(it was interesting 👍)...

And i predicted it was Tonkla from his shaky hands..maybe he knew about great being an accomplice nd how he helped Title with body disposal of Dome.. So he took revenge and killed both Title and Great(maybe he got the car dashcam footage?)... And now he's wanted by the police👍

I love this show.. It's genius... I really liked Jesbible in this ep.. It was natural... Great was not too kind... He was 💀coward and Tyme lmao 🤣🤣posting video on 4hub (and also Great is freaky like who in the right mind will follow Tyme after that..he really is shameless haan wow..💀) (i thought he set that secret camera to find out Great's dirt (hit nd run) nd title case) but he just did that (all for nothing 💀)...i also thought Great will get revenge (but bro got so hooked after their hookup and became cute puppy after that 😂)and the durex ad nd packet lube lmao🤣🤣.. Also sleepy cat tortured to eat that sponsored cat food (poor babie😂)..

I love this show.. I still don't know what's real nd fake at this point.. But i have no clue how the next eps will be... This bl has my fav genre.. And I'm enjoying all this suspense/thriller/mystery ❤

I also liked Tymegreat scenes(noodle/scared of dogs/handholding) felt domestic/natural and fluffy... I liked this scenes in this ep ❤more than the arcade/boba tea one ..

Here’s what would have made GreatTyme be a real romance, with heat, which is what I wanted, but Sammon and Pond don’t want us to have:

Tyme knocks into Great in the hospital before knowing his name and is absolutely stunned by how hot he is (the most realistic thing that could have occurred; it’s absurd it doesn’t, have you SEEN Bible in that shirt?!)

Tyme later goes to the bar, because his research shows that the rich gay son goes there. He sees Great again and can’t help but talk to him, immediately attracted. They banter and only then does Tyme find out that Great is actually the son he’s been researching. He’s shocked.

Great makes a move and they wind up at Great’s. We see Tyme torn because this was supposed to be about revenge but it’s become something else because he’s super into Great

He’s torn but decides to discreetly set up his phone before things get serious

They have sex and it’s clear it’s about mutual magnetic attraction and there’s more emotion to it than either of them expect because they’re both wounded lonely souls looking for connection but so afraid of it

At no point does anyone have to go to the bathroom

Tyme is torn afterwards but decides to go through with blackmail

Great finds him and they have that date as shown and it’s clear they’re both into each other but Tyme is torn

Tyme tells Great they can’t see each other but he’s obviously upset

The rest can basically happen as we saw

BUT THAT’S NOT WHAT HAPPENED

BECAUSE THERE IS NO ROMANCE OR FATED LOVE STORY SUBPLOT

IT’S JUST ABOUT WOUNDED, MORALLY GRAY CHARACTERS WHO ARE GOING TO DIE

BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANT US TO BE HAPPY

Oh I’m a little gagged. I think this might be my favorite episode overall so far. (Will have to rewatch all episodes to be sure) But the plot twist, the flow, and finally THAT scene*

Everyone is morally gray and I love that. Great being the spoiled little rich bitch that he is. But with a little bit of a conscience. Just a little bit lol. Tyme, baby that was nasty work. But he was kind of sweet afterwards 😩 And then there’s sweet, doe eyed baby boy turned serial shooter Tonkla (and I’m not mad at it).

*Though I will admit I’m a little salty we’re not getting the spice level we deserve with these TymeGreat nc scenes. Like the first one I can understand, but I was expecting like level 11 today and I got maybe a 7. I mean, I still enjoyed it, I just needed more 😮‍💨

When i first saw the snippets of their them doing "that" shown in the previous episodes through Great's time memory, i thought it'll be a beautiful moment of them with such passionate intent they have for one another with the way they painted it..but nahh, it ended up WAY messy of an outcome than what I've expected. Like Tyme out here exposing Great, they're both acting like strangers and their one-night stand situation. This episode is TRULY mindblowing and it conveys a different perspective with how it would have gone if Great didn't alter his actions, again I am LOVING this SM. I love time traveling and their decision-based format, it's SO fascinating to see each varying aftermaths.

I don't interact much here but I follow the show. I wanted to ask if someone else noticed this or could explain. In ep 3 Tyme visits Great in his university he gives him a drink with a note asking him to check his head injury but it changes for a second to Tyme asking Great to forgive him. But this scene did not appear in the original timeline they showed today. Will it be explained in upcoming episodes?

I think that was probably Great's mind 'wishing' that Tyme would regret what he did, or possibly Tyme's flashbacks bleeding in as maybe he will regret the revenge porn.

this also bugged me and i’ve read multiple theories but none really feel like they fit. i’m hoping something in an upcoming ep makes it make sense. otherwise the “wishful thinking” theory is the predominant one but I think if that’s the case, it’s unnecessarily confusing.

So your basically saying that Tyme does survive his wound and head injury the one where he almost had brain damage. So Tyme gives him a drink at his school that says forgive me?

Hm I woke up and I had this this thought: Could the two different storylines we saw be either testimonies Great and Tyme give to the police, or both storylines were the idealised versions Great’s and Tyme’s brains are conjuring up and we are yet to see what really happened? 🤔 We already know what we are being shown isn’t a linear timeline and we also know there’s different POVs and both are/were probably dead or dying at some point in the story.

Ugh I’m slightly confused and I’m loving it! 😄

Late to the party because I have a big girl job (help I work 7 days a week, I am so tired. When Jungkook said '7 days a week' I did not think he meant THIS).

This show is WILD.

So Great's actually a terrible person and everything we've seen so far is him trying to recreate his memories whilst he dies. Careful Great, your Vegas is showing.

'I ordered them to delete all the CCTV footage' CHILLS. Honestly kinda sad Great is a piece of shit. I liked soft Bible. 'You hit and killed someone with your car' EXACTLY. Have some remorse Vegas...I mean, Great. Tbh if I hit and killed someone with my car, send me to jail. Like damn, their whole family is immoral. 'Great thank your Dad for covering up the murder you just did'. Great's 4 minute brain deprived of oxygen making his victim suicidal to cope with the fact that he killed her is insane. Great and Korn probably have a shit relationship too which is why he imagined it was better and that Korn a bad guy.

I keep forgetting about Title. But what a fucking Psychopath, get some new friends Great. You can't just ..like...kill people?!?! Poor Dome. 'Dome was stressed, jumped in the water and killed himself' Oh yeah and he also smashed his own face in with a rock. Title you dumbass. I kinda feel like Great maybe has some morality but he's a product of terrible circumstances and has bad people around him. And a shit Father. And complacent Mother. Bible & having characters with shit Fathers lol. Hope his irl Dad is nice 😂

THE CAT 🥹 Chonky bby

So tike is 'normal' now because this is the real world and what ACTUALLY happened. (On a side note: Speaking of time and clocks, I went to check my laundry earlier and the washing machine had 4 minutes left).

GREAT AND HIS LOW CUT V. YOUR VEGAS IS SHOWING.

Does Thyme know what's going on? With the whole reality, 4 minutes thing? I wouldn't be surprised, Sammon has pulled this move before (Triage when Tol started living the time loop after Tin 'died').

Sponsored by Durex.

FOURHUB 💀

'Sup Dad'. Fucking LOL. 
Always the parents pissed off their sons are gay.

Nah I miss Soft, kinda shy Great. Take me back to their kiss in the car after they won the plushies.

Thyme's PARENTS started the gambling business. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?!?!

Ah so Korn's still a piece of shit.

I love all the subtle differences between the scenesx

RIP Nan.

Yeah we knew Tonkla wasn't a good person when he whipped out his meth pipe and cheated on his boyfriend with the cop assigned to investigate his brother's murder.

2 mire eps left! 8 episodes simply is not long enough.

Okay, I know everyone is aboard the ‘Great is evil’ train, but I have to say even in this version/timeline whatever, I think he is a weak man and grey, but not evil. Like he’s not evil for killing the lady with his car. She straight up is trying to get killed and jumps into the road in a tunnel pedestrians shouldn’t be in. Is he weak or cowardly for fleeing the scene? For sure, but there’s no malice involved here. And then when he doesn’t rescue Nan in time, same deal. He hesitated due to fear and she got shot. The biggest sin, for me, is when he helps dispose of the body. You can be shocked at witnessing murder, but you need to then say ‘yeah, screw you I’m out of here’ (at the minimum). I just feel it’s important to distinguish the world where he wants to be the hero. That his inner desires are to go against the values he’s been raised with his entire life. So it’s not Evil Great timeline for me, is Realistic Great timeline. And in both of them he’s a sad puppy that desperately wants any crumbs of affection that Time will give him.

Just FYI -- the Global Streaming link in the main post is linked to the wrong subreddit post. (There needs to be an "s" inbetween "boy" and "love" in the URL. The link goes to a banned subreddit!)

Does anyone have an opinion on Gaga vs. iQIYI? I don't have time to analyze the subtitles from both, but was wondering if someone else has looked at them!

Ok I am taking a breath and just giving my hot takes before I got back now and rewatch:

I was too anxious waiting for the NC to come so I didn't pay attention to anything truly until it happened. Then I was lost there for a while until I got angry and now I hate ALL BATHROOMS EVERYWHERE FOREVER and also yay Tyme could keep it hard while being inspector gadget and casually slip a condom on after 10 min of walking around. FourHub vs Pornhub is my favorite. Let us know how many of you searched for SECRET.mp4 already 🤣

post my anger about the NC being abruptly interrupted when it could have been the greatest NC of all time I didn't pay attention to much that happened after that

the end yes Kla I am on your team. You gave us EPIC NCs with so much context that I am jumping over to your team and you can go head and kill them all tbh.

Baddie Great (although a coward) is way hotter than ep1-5 Great by an exponentially huge percentage. Since ep1 we saw that Great's initial instincts are not those of a great human. Only his revised memory in hindsight seems to understand what the right thing to do is.

I knew it. We are getting different POV all out of order and Great's and Tyme's memories + added in hindsight I would have done x differently while both are on the verge of death. Sammon is a doctor and won't go fully into timelines and scifi. She just likes to explore human decisions and medical mysteries.

Once I rewatch without rage and anticipation and can properly pay attention I will come back.

Can someone help me, why didn't Greats mom get shot again? I don't understand. If episode 6 is showing the reality of how things actually happened, does that mean 'Nice Great' wanted her to die in the previous episode or what? I'm confused.

Probably. He realizes she is not a good person. Maybe.

Is the “so sultry” version on Gaga or IQIYI? Bc I just saw a clip from an NC scene in epi 4 that I had not seen, and I have been watching the sultry version on IQIYI. Does Viu have its own version of the show? (It was a really short clip so I don’t know exactly what’s going on but it looks like Tonk La went to Wins apartment?)

The prevailing theory is that ep 6 is the original timeline — what actually happened. Everything we’ve seen that conflicts / changes what we’ve seen in ep 6 is Great revising events due to wishful thinking / regret during the 4 minutes he’s still alibe after his heart stops beating when he got shot.

Episode 6 tells us what REALLY happened, not the alternate reality Great is creating after his heart attack.

Very flat and boring for me. I didn't love it. Its GrearTyme . It was interrupted and lacked intensity for me.

Others may disagree.

ok so this was another parallel universe where great didnt save the woman and his relationship with tyme was mostly tyme's revenge... and also fuckin title killin' dome, i guess this is the connection to the beggining and the ending of this episode, tonkla killed great that's why the police was searching tonkla's house at the beggining, maybe title sent part of that footage to him?

They summarized 5 episodes into one to show another version, lol. I also felt like I was watching the Battle of the Bastards from Game of Thrones because I couldn't see a damn thing!

anywho i was like this the entire episode

Edit: wait im seeing on twitter that some are saying thi is the OG timeline and Great is in a coma cause Tonkla shot him? Pls i need answerssss

The theory is that episodes 1-5 Great's scenes were just in his mind and it was a wishful thinking of what he would have done if he could travel to the past and fix his mistakes (not killing the lady in the hit and run, saving Dome and Nan) and of course helping Tyme and having a loving relationship with him.

This episode 6 shows what happened in the real world and Great's real personality (a rich brat who didn't care about anything and was able to commit murder) and of course his relationship with Tyme was just sex and not love. Great probably regretted everything when Tyme called him a COWARD and while he is dying, he imagines the other timeline (episodes 1-5).

She never got shot because the lady died before being able to hire a hitman. This is the crumb I'm holding onto to justify the multiple timelines plotline, since there is a solid divergence and consequence of Great fixing his mistakes (which wouldn't happen if he was just imagining a world where he manages to save everyone while his brain is shutting down form the 4 minutes of no oxygen). He has no way of knowing that the lady has a grudge against his family, so the other timeline can't just be all in his head right? :(

YESSS THE SULTRY RETURNS🔥🔥🔥 There been so many hot scenes but seeing JesBible's entire sexy bodies is a whole another level🥵🥵🥵

So my predictions are right so far, it is another timeline and the 4 minutes are visions from the previous times.

But he's died twice now and there might be another twist lurking.

I can't believe we're almost done. This series goes by way too fast. 🥺🥺

I have to say I am surprised and really delighted that this show is so gorgeous. Not just the NC scenes, but the whole thing is practically cinematic. The lighting, photography, score, all of it is a joy to watch.   

I spent a couple of episodes wondering what the hell was going on with TonKla's storyline, since it didn't make sense with what we were seeing (strongly implied he killed Title, who we later saw alive, etc.)... but what we were seeing was Great's near-death revisionist history and since he didn't know anything about TonKla it makes sense now that we never got a "revised" version of what was happening there. I think. But we still have 2 episodes left, and a few questions still left from the earlier eps (will there ever be an explanation for the note on the cup of iced tea? What would Tyme have to ask Great's forgiveness for?) so I can't imagine Great's death is going to take immediately,  unless he spends them in the pink room of brain death with the other 4 minutes patient which seems like a bit of a waste.  

Nothing better happen to that cat, is all.
