when Win dropped his bags I screamed. lol Honestly, this is what I don't understand about bl: the whole "no, no we can't possibly!" bit where guy #1 is forward and ready to go and guy #2 is always saying no and looking disinterested. The way Win is *always* down to fuck when prompted is probably the most realistic portrayal of m/m relationship dynamics I've seen in a bl so far.

BoC *stays* dragging the gworls.

BoC's Cinematography
I recently read a book called Recursion by Blake Crouch (I highly recommend it and him as an author. His books are great - especially Dark Matter), and its premise was that there was a thing called a Memory Chair that had initially been created to help people with Alzheimer's but you could use it to go back to a specific memory and relive your life starting from that point. However, you and the people around you who were affected by the memory change would get 'false memories' once the timelines converged in the future and they would remember the dead timeline, and it didn't end up great, usually.

It made me wonder if we are seeing dead timelines here, moving together. The picture of Tongkla and his brother when they were kids sure looked like Dome. I think we are seeing two timelines overlapping with each other, and Great is the Recursion/Convergence. So, when we see Tongkla, we are seeing a timeline where Dome wasn't saved. Mod is the friend that Win tried to question, who we of course also see with Great. Maybe Tongkla killed Title as revenge, but maybe he killed someone else (Korn or Great since this case is obviously metastasizing). Title's dad is a big deal - is the police chief Title's dad and that's why he's trying to cover up the murder? It's just a working theory and obviously not all fleshed out, and I could be WAY off base, but just putting it out there.

I know people aren't here for plot theories today and are here for the porn, but why not both?

This series is doing a spectacular job of telling stories through intimate scenes imho. I feel like 90% of the scenes we've seen Tongkla in were somehow related to sex, and yet he also feels like the character I know best and feel most connected to. It's not just sex, all those scenes tell us so much about who he is as a person, and I love that.

That flashback to his first time with Korn, I was honestly shook. It's such an emotionally complicated scene: Korn definitely holds the power there and it certainly feels a little weird; only time will tell what kind of person Korn really is. Part of me at the same time can't help feeling sorry for Korn never being able to be himself around his family, for not being able to make true on his promise. Meanwhile Tongkla is just so vulnerable and open, I honestly got goosebumps.

And now with Win he seems to repeat the sexual patterns Korn taught him; I guess this is just how he has learned to show and receive love. Except this time Tongkla is very much the one holding the reins. For the first time, he's in a relationship, inasfar as we can call it that, where he's not dependent, and he's enjoying having power over someone for once, while at the same time filling whatever hole is left in his soul. He's really a very lonely character.

Like most people, I am also definitely wondering whether he is the murderer, though, especially after that opening scene.

tl;dr I am absolutely fascinated by the dynamics between these three characters.

And then we have Great and Tyme... I did feel like I wanted them to have a bit more of a chat before moving on to the NC scene, but then they looked at each other and I honestly stopped caring lmao. The gentle hair brush. The way Great kept laughing a little. It all felt so real. Honestly kudos to whoever is directing all those intimate scenes and the actors executing them, chef's kiss, no notes.

I'm also wondering if their closeness being slightly rushed is intentional, if they're feeling more drawn to each other because they already have history (that Great is vaguely recalling from wherever), and this is making them feel closer and more trusting of each other than they should maybe be.

Also, I assume the other person in that red room that woman was seeing was Great? But I thought it looked more like Tyme tbh? Or am I just imagining things?

OMG I WAS RIGHT? Hahaha - Peep my post before the episode started. We have overlapping timelines.

The difference between Then Tongkla and Now Tongkla is staggering. I dunno - I feel like Korn groomed him. Korn obviously does love Tongkla, but he was Tongkla's first lover, rescued him from an abusive household, bought him a house (gilded cage), promised him that he would tell the world that he was Tongkla's boyfriend - only to have a fiancee and Tongkla is still the dirty secret sidepiece that he doesn't call for weeks, and only comes to fuck him and didn't care about what Tongkla had been going through until Tongkla forced the matter. "You dare to kick me out" isn't a line you use with someone that you really, truly love.

Korn was so villainous this episode. Even the scenes where he was being sweet with Tongkla had a sinister undercurrent. He groomed this boy. He's trying to be good cop with Nan even though he's running an illegal casino and trying to have the high ground. His reaction to finding out that Tongkla's brother was dead wasn't "Oh baby, I'm so sorry, let me comfort you", it was "who did it so I can exert power of them for you to further engraciate you to me."

Win is such a mess. He's down BAD for this broken, beautiful boy. Like, he looked so pathetic and sad coming out from hiding in his underwear, heartbroken that Tongkla had someone else. He was love at first sight and will never know a moment of peace from now on. The way that Tongkla was so fucking happy to get fucked raw was hot as hell, but just really sad too. Korn has always kept him at arm's length in his lonely apartment and is keeping him a secret so he just wanted to FEEL something. This triangle is so interesting to me.

I kinda wish we'd gotten more explanation about what exactly is happening with Tyme and Nan. Great was just like "okay I'll help you" and there hasn't really been many questions besides that. Maybe we'll get some answers next week after they've fucked it out of their systems. Props to Nan, though. That girl is NOT breaking.

I loved the contrast between all the sex scenes in terms of tone. WinTonkla was so desperate and full of *need*, KornTonkla was very sweet and innocent (except had this sinister air around it because we know how their relationship ended up despite Korn's pinkie promise), and TymeGreat was full of smiles and while it was kind of awkward, it was very sweet and naturally so (the first time is never fireworks).

Lukwa is so cute! Her and Den in the same scenes just smiling are so healing. They both have such great, warm smiles. So, she was the one that Great saw (which I had already assumed).

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs part of the character, but Dr. Tyme/Jes has the sweetest, most deliberate gestures. His index finger here seems to be counting the seconds until he makes his next move.

I‚Äôm actually glad the main couple‚Äôs NC scene is more soft and slow burn because it‚Äôs going to make the last couple of episodes a lot spicier haha. That being said they need a lot more scenes together to make up for the lack of screen time though.

Ok, it took me two watches to soak it all in. The first watch had a lot of ff and 2.0x to see quickly if it was safe. Now I rewatched FULLY and calmly and without being completely lost in the incredible varying emotions of the NCs that honestly had me laying on the cold tile floor in my office for a bit.

Ok. Here we go.

After watching every single episode of Criminal Minds for YEARS...I immediately recognized Korn's manipulation at work since ep1 BUT in this episode it was clear that he is without the shadow of doubt, a Narcissistic SOCIOPATH WHO MANIPULATES BECAUSE it brings him a high that he can't get any other way. SOCIOPATHS are incapable of feeling love. What they FEEL is adrenaline and POWER when they can CONTROL and INFLICT EMOTIONAL PAIN on other humans WHILE GIVING THE APPEARANCE of being well intentioned.

From the flashback, we learned that Korn INTENTIONALLY made Ton Kla remove the cat collar. He smiled as he watched broken-hearted Ton Kla kneel down and get the collar. Anyone with humanity, if they truly cared about another human, would have removed the collar FOR THEM. His intentions were NOT genuine even back then. He saw a broken prey that he could mold into everything he wanted and make him dependent on Korn emotionally and financially. There is zero love from Korn. Ton Kla is just a release for Korn. From the way he feels powerless in his relationship with his father, stepmother, and fianc√©. And the cat collar was intentioned as reminder to Ton kla of KORN'S ALLEGED CARING. BUT TO KORN THAT WAS A KEY to his control. He even immediately tied a ribbon around Ton kla's head to claim his ownership over every thought of Tonkla going forward. He OWNS HIM now. Forever.

Their first time shown here in parallel to GreatTyme's first time which was fueled by adrenaline.

The scene where we saw Title trust Great to kills someone with him. Showed us that Great's personality lends to his friends trusting him blindly. However when he refused to kill, and we were told he also released the imprisoned girl in a prior episode was foreshadowing to today's episode. Great doesn't hesitate to do THE RIGHT THING....AFTER he considers and sees the alternative. He didn't jump in to help Tyme or to save this girl today UNTIL AFTER he "saw" the consequences of his inaction. And it makes complete sense that he would help Tyme without any hesitation AFTER he heard and saw the consequences of inaction on his part.

I don't think this series has ANY romance tbh. This is a series about human intentions and decisions and adrenaline induced action. I don't think Great is in love with Tyme at all and the other way around either. They are somehow being pulled together by grief and curiosity and power and mainly adrenaline.

And Ton Kla is now acting towards Cop the same way he learned from Korn. The tables are turned. His constant request for RAW or UP ME (for those that don't know that means he wants cop to cum inside him) is symbolic....a desperate yearning to FEEL SOMETHING REAL.

Bas is honestly killing it. Every micro expression is giving sociopath. And the contrast of his gentle voice is PERFECTION. HE WANTS TO APPEAR GENTLE while being lethal. He did the same exact song and dance with the kidnapped girl as he does with Ton Kla.

And his rage and tear filled eyes when Ton Kla kicked him out was not hurt because his love kicked him out. It was rage that the object he owned had the gall to turn on him.

This series is honestly spectacular.

Every single detail has a purpose. Cop coming back in without pants shows he is not covering anything up he is raw and exposed and down bad for Ton Kla. He has Savior's Syndrome. He sees a broken boy and wants to be his savior. The same way Korn "seemed" to be that but Korn was dressed immaculately and wearing panties üòú and he ASKED TON KLA to remove them. While cop immediately willingly removed all his layers. Korn also asked Ton Kla NOT to remove his shirt. He said he would do it. He kept a layer of the shirt on Ton Kla their entire first time. While with cop Ton Kla was completely exposed.

I know many may say that the NCs are gratuitous and perhaps with a lot more writing the same nuances of these characters could maybe have been told with clothes but the fact that everything in every NC so far has had SYMBOLIC meaning is spectacular.

Also BIBLE'S TATS HAD ME SO DEAD. ALSO GREAT'S RED CAR HAS ME IN A CHOKEHOLD however I wish they didn't ride the gears like they did cause my heart hurt for the car.

Great screaming oh shit and just yelling on the bridge also told us that Great is highly addicted to this ADRENALINE. He has been mostly calm from our pov. But today showed us that adrenaline is definitely A DRUG HE LIKED AT FIRST TRY.

NOTE: 4 MINUTES FROM THE HAIR

BLACK CAT from ep1. Then we had the cats from the claw machine too. Lots of cats. Oh god then we have Great's actual cat. Man I hope nothing happens to that cat ü´£

Anyone else think clip before the credits are the real version of events? Ep1. Great is in hospital coding at 11 o'clock whilst Tyme is being gunned down. Ep2. Tongkla murdering someone with a rock. Ep3. A body is found. Ep.4 Murder investigations with someone being linked by DNA. Cop guy seems to know the name.

Great's scenes appear fragmented to me. We don't see much interaction with Tyme, they just kind of end up in places like their date. When they are in the hotel room Great even laughs saying he doesn't know where they are. It's all safe and romantic when they've just gone on the run supposedly. We don't see Great question anything that's happening with his family and Tyme/Nan. He's mostly in white and Tyme in black. I think he's re-living memories, that Great and Tyme are dying at the same time.

My guess with Tongkla is that he manipulated moustache cop into helping him find out who killed his brother. Afterwards, once they find out the police protected Title, he helps him get revenge. I think moustache cop is the one shooting Tyme but then where does Korn fit into it all and why is Tyme a victim. I don't know why we are seeing Dome go back to Tongklas house other than Tongkla is hallucinating.

The 4 minutes room with that lady I'm guessing is some kind of pergatory. I can't explain the psychologist friend of Tyme's meeting the lady and Great though.

Sorry for long comment, I can't sleep üòÖ. Loved this episode and reading everyone's theories.

Durex did not sponsor this episode. I repeat. Durex did not sponsor this episode!! üòÜüòÜ

I love Tonkla/Win scenes sm! Sad broken boys is my jam and Tonkla is delivering on that part. And Win is just willing to give and give and give to someone that cannot reciprocate is both heartbreaking and hilarious to watch. The man is whipped.

Bible was magnetic in this episode. The way he portrayed being on a adrenaline high and trying to calm down from that, the way he laughed and smiled at Tyme before and during sex was mesmerising. I didn‚Äôt feel like the GreatTyme sex scene was too intimate. There was a lightness to it, like they were comfortable with each other, but not yet in love w each other.

If we assume that there are two timelines and each timeline has its own people, like there is the Tonkla that lost his brother and the Tonkla that didn‚Äôt, then that means there should be another Great. There is a Great that did not save any of the people he‚Äôs saved in the past 4 episodes including Tyme. I think that that Great is the one having a heart attack, stuck for 4 minutes somewhere between life and death trying to fix everything before it‚Äôs too late.

While I don't mind the Tonkla, Win and Korn triangle story, I am disappointed at how little screentime GreatTyme is getting. I haven't actually paid attention to minutes, but it feels like they aren't getting their fair share considering they are supposed to be the main couple? :/
Their NC scene almost felt a bit sudden to me, because we didn't have much of a relationship progression during the episode? It went from "rescue the girl" to "first time" so quickly, it felt a bit odd. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI hope we get to see more of them and what their deals are from now on.

Ngl I‚Äôm 35 minutes in and I‚Äôm a tiny bit annoyed at how Korn Tonkla focused this is, particularly since this is the in-theatre ep. I have no problem with side couples but the balance is starting to feel really off with the amount of scenes we‚Äôve had of KornTonkla and WinTonkla vs the very little with Tyme and Great.

Sigh. Anyway will come back here later with more!

Time seems to pause as they hover close. A beautiful blend of longing and restraint. Its like their world (and perhaps ours too) shrinking to just this moment. Tyme's kisses is so purposeful, shows so much intent.

We indeed had a great time with ..............GreatTyme.. pun intended.

Listen I don't know if it was just me but I think I waited more from the NC scene of Great-Tyme?! Or maybe their scene is to be more like this, more romantic than the ones from Tonkla to show us a more deep romantic connection between Great-Tyme?
Like even the scene of Tonkla-Win was more hornier than theirs...
I don't even feel like this episode was that on fire +18 like they had been saying for a week in that poster...
Anyways so Dome really was Tonkla brother at the end! I guess Tonkla killed Title, the brother's murderer, remember that opening scene from episode 2?
I wonder what will happen with Tonkla and the cop because that scene of Korn wanting to force Tonkla?! Excuse me?! You can see that Tonkla no longer loves Korn like he did in the past. He just waited him to get out to go down on Win o.o
This is really getting toxic now I can sense a big jealous murderous beating moment coming up oh my god o.o
At this point I'm definitely more involved and interested with Korn, Tonkla and Win story than the mains, sorry.

Ditto! I was all set for it to be intense and serious, given the buildup. However, those little moments of chatter between them actually brought a suprising warmth. There was so much thoughtfulness in their exchanges, judging from the deliberations, even though it‚Äôs clear how much they want each other,. At this point, I'm already rooting for them to have a happily ever after, but of course, we all know they‚Äôre just getting started.

if the black cat was dead while korn and tonkla was still at uni then the black cat after the first nc scene with korn and tonkla was a flashbackü§î

So I was thinking the same thing!!!! Mayne not necessarily a flashback but somehowe inside of Ton Kla's mind just like the cab "seemed" like Dome was alive. Like wishful thinking? OR both Ton Kla and Great are kinda dying and we are seeing inside both of their brains?

Alright, at the end of the day, I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôve read all the theories here and on MDL. I‚Äôve watched every ep at least twice and ep 2 five times.

It COULD be that Sammon has revealed all the clues and it‚Äôs just a matter of putting them together and someone here has already gotten it right. It could ALSO be that she‚Äôs withholding key clues that once revealed, would rule out everyone‚Äôs theories.

I think Sammon has played with both corruption AND timeline changes in her past works, so it‚Äôs not clear to me which direction she may take it. I‚Äôm not going to focus on the question of timelines / alternate realities. I‚Äôll wait for more information.

I do think that we‚Äôre seeing many morally grey characters. I‚Äôm not sold on any of our mains ‚Äî Great, Tyme, Tonkla, Korn, Win ‚Äî being ALL good or ALL bad. Not even Title is all bad, he didn‚Äôt seem like a bad friend to Great when we first meet him. Tyme seems like a cold jerk but is obviously very tender to his Grandma and is fighting for a good cause. Great makes bad choices and regrets them.

I also think we‚Äôre seeing how sex can be experienced and used in a variety of ways ‚Äî love, desperation, escape, control. I agree with u/ThoughtsAllDay that we‚Äôre learning so much through those sex scenes. The difference between Ton Kla‚Äôs blissed out love expression after he and Korn have sex in ep 1 is in stark contrast to his expressionless/empty face after he has sex with Win. GreatTyme seem to be just two dudes who fell for each other and are actually having, like, relationship sex, which is both attraction and connection. It‚Äôs maybe not my favorite storytelling technique but it‚Äôs definitely, well, telling a story.

At the end of the day, I think the series has an interesting plot and is something different than usual, and that‚Äôs fun. I liked the series more when I thought it was going to be romance and a happy ending but this is not that, so now I‚Äôm a bit emotionally distant from it because Sammon isn‚Äôt here to comfort me and make me believe in the power of love. At least, I don‚Äôt think she is. I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve never finished a Sammon series.

I mean personally I prefer explicit yearning, tension, romance, more cardigans, and a guaranteed happy ending over, like, murder, sadness, and graphic desperation sex but I am happy to be watching something in real-time again as part of a community.

ü•π yeah, Sammon is not one that likes to comfort...sadly.

I'm glad you were able to come to terms with the fact this isn't a romance yet are still finding ways to enjoy it differently. This may be the first Sammon series you finish! Especially given it is 8 eps not 13 as per her usual.

You may not be comforted by Sammon but I can't explain to you the comfort I FEEL seeing you engaged in this puzzle of clues. ‚ù§Ô∏è

You have talked about the NC scenes, so my turn to talk about the mystery.

The theory of (at least) two timelines has been proven true:

In one of them Dome is alive and happily talking and visiting TonKla and in the other one is dead and TonKla is grieving.

I read the theory that "the happy timeline" doesn't exist and it's just Great fixing his mistakes in his mind before passing away. Sincerely I hope YOU ARE NOT RIGHT. I know BOC shows doesn't characterize for having a super happy endings but I don't need a show where everyone is dead (Hello there, DFF).

If there are two timelines then we haven't met yet the key characters in the other timeline:

We haven't watched TonKla in the happy timeline where his brother is alive (he talked with Dome on telephone but we just saw the sad TonKla who doesn't see his brother).

We haven't watched Great and Tyme in the sad timeline (except in the prologue where both of them are dying). Great didn't save the woman in the first episode, Dome and Nan in this timeline so he probably is not a goody two shoes and we don't know Tyme either, but I think he is more or less the same in both timelines.

P.S: I know a lot of you are fed up of TonKla having too much screentime, but he has to be a key character, maybe the antagonist, so probably is not wasted time.

Really? Because I saw it as Great staring INTENTLY at Tyme, drinking in all his reactions. Unlike the other NC scenes - Win and Tongkla only passingly looked at each other because it was all about desperate pleasure, and Korn and Tongkla felt so meticulous, like Korn was taking Tongkla apart psychically and physically. But Great *cared* how Tyme was reacting. He wanted to see the effect he was having. He wasn't moaning and wailing and arching, but you don't look that intently at someone during sex if you're having a bad time. You tend to face away or stare up at the ceiling or keep your eyes closed.

Here‚Äôs my rating on the realism of the NC scenes in this episode (from the perspective of a gay male haha). I‚Äôm just going by order and leaving out names for spoilers sake. This is just based on realism not my enjoyment ;).

6.5/10 The spice is there for sure but the facial expressions from the actors are a bit over exaggerated? It feels a bit comical without context. Also no lube or prepping in sight lol.

8/10 A rather short scene so not much to judge but pretty realistic overall. If they were going to do anything in that position however the top should probably be a little lower.

8.5/10 One of the better first time scenes but again they kind of skip over any lube/prepping. What makes it good though is the pacing and body placement/natural movement from both actors. Only thing is the bottom‚Äôs thighs should up a little higher. The moaning, pauses, kisses in between and natural movement definitely shows both actors experience though.

Ok so I had already lost all hope of Korn being a good guy back when he took over the illegal part of the business without seemingly having any issues with it and then obv. how he just straight up ignored poor Tonkla in the last episode.
But man, this episode just drove it home further that he is a baad dude! He didn't contact Ton for WEEKS?! And then just shows up, whines about the bad time HE's had and immediately wants some action without picking up on Ton obviously being down?! And then doesn't even jump to comforting mode when he is told that Ton's brother got killed! Wow...
The flashback to them during college is so sad all things considered.
Ton was obviously inexperienced and prob. also seeking love and support after coming from a shitty household, and Korn really moulded him into his perfect little dirty-secret-sidepiece that he could use and control with promises of love and future commitments.
No wonder Ton is messed up and confused.

I‚Äôve said it multiple times, but I‚Äôm convinced Great is fixing all his mistakes in this second timeline‚Äîthe one that involved the death of Tonkla‚Äôs brother, Nan, Tyme, and eventually, his own. Even with an omniscient narrator, they‚Äôre unreliable because the timelines aren‚Äôt clear, they mix together and leave us confused.

Seeing JJ‚Äôs penis definitely wasn‚Äôt on my bingo card, though I‚Äôm not sure if it was his or a prosthetic. And honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if I want to know.

Late to the party but omg THIS EPISODE.

'Heir from a powerful family' - Why do I think Korn killed Tonkla's brother?

Tonkla meeds therapy. I hate this whole Win/Tonkla/Korn situation. Feels icky. Who am I supposed to hate here? üòÇüòÇ

'Sorry i've been gone for so long, I had something urgent to take care of' Okay but Tonkla's brother was murdered and Tonkla was left to manage it all alone you selfish fuck. Hate that he was literally just there for sex, he didn't even bother asking about Tonkla. Lowkey so exciting when he kicked Korn out. Kinda feel bad for Win, he's so whipped and Tonkla just doesn't know what he wants (I mean besides a raw fuck üòâ).

Omg WHO KILLED THE CAT? Tonkla is either a psychopath or it's Korn. Neither of them are giving very sane vibes. Korn killing everyone and everything close to Tonkla so he has ONLY Korn to rely on OR Tonkla is a psychopath or has something like Schizophrenia and isn't aware of what he's doing.

(Side Note: Sometimes when I look at Tonkla at a certain angle briefly he looks like Hyunjin).

Oh Korn for sure groomed Tonkla. And Tonkla loves him but has slowly realised over the years he's actually a massive lying cunny. Oh because he took over the family business. Makes total sense. It's always the 'family business' turning people into simply The Worst‚Ñ¢Ô∏è people. Poor Tonkla still a side piece whilst Korn is engaged to Fasai. I want to know the story there. DO you love him though Korn?

4 minutes being the amount of time the brain can survive without oxygen leads me to believe this entire thing is Great having some sort of hallucination whilst he dies. Like maybe he really knows these people and wishes he did things differently and that's why he keeps imagining something different with the 4 Minutes thing, or maybe this whole thing is just a complete fantasy and none of these people are even connected.

Damn Nan is really going through it. No idea what her connection in all of this is yet but I feel bad she's clearly been tortured. Hope the guy who punched and kicked her dies xoxox

Nah you don't GET to be sad Korn.

The fact that they know it was Great who got Nan out is not going to bode well for his relationship with Korn. But it apparently gas for his relationship with Thyme YEOOOOOWWWW LET'S GO! Love that he doesn't even know where they are.

The HAIRRRR. The forehead kissssssss. The giggles. Aw they're so gentle. I wonder if those leg tatts are real. The comment that said their full sex scene was 4 minutes long - you just know they're gonna backtrack on that next episode üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Lol I forgot about this guy, WAIT HOLD THE FUCK UP. THERE'S TWO TIMELINES GOING ON HERE? So he IS Tonkla's brother. And in that case it WAS Title who killed him? I am SO SO confused. The plot THICKENS.

Next week needs to hurry up actually.

Don‚Äôt stone me but it felt like Great wasn‚Äôt really showing enjoyment during the NC scene. Guess I was expecting more moans and visuals of him lost in bliss gasping for air.

It was still incredibly sweet and soft and I liked that, but with how hyped it was I was hoping to see something more idk ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù or emotionally laden, shocking, etc. Not that emotions weren‚Äôt there, but you get me.

Maybe it‚Äôs meant to be a slow burn in the NC department for Tyme and Great so let‚Äôs see how far they take it. Maybe they‚Äôll surprise us.

I think we were all expecting the scenes he keeps seeing in his memories and the one we all keep seeing in our minds from the trailer.

So yes. I was disappointed too. Again, due to erroneous expectations. Not because the scene was bad. Also the whole prior scenes being about adrenaline also made me expect...adrenaline fueled sex which this was not.

So I think the expectations were not met given the hype and what we know the trailer and Great's memories showed us. And that adrenaline discussion prior to the scene.

First of all congratulations on Ton Kla for finally getting what he wants after 3 episodes. Also the boy needs some rest, he is caring the 18+ rating on his shoulders for way too many episodes now. Now that this is out of the way, what if the seeing into the future thing is just Great looking back on what he sees as his mistakes and trying to rectify them somehow, creating like a fork in the timeline that sometimes seeps into the reality but it is not actually real. I know i don't make much sense but this is what this series is doing to me Comment Image

I am severely confused about a few things

First... in Tonkla's flashback, he and Korn were already a couple but had never had sex, so was that Tonkla's first time? Because how can they be a couple when Korn didn't know basic things like Tonkla has no experience in kissing so he's going to teach him how to do it, but then they are like "I love you so much"; help, or having sex, confessing, and becoming a couple all happened in that day? lol

Is Dome alive in the same dimension that Tonkla is in? Or could it be that the influence of the 4 minutes has affected something? Because how come we see Dome alive but Tonkla and the inspector consider him dead?

____

Tonkla finally was fucked raw, we celebrate that his dream came true.

inspector's dong was out bro,

who is Mr. Anuwat Warindej???????

the difference between two people who love each other korn and tonkla (- at least in the flashback and ep1-) and when one is only using the other (tonkla to the inspector). I really appreciate the quality of acting we are getting, the dynamics are totally different and I can even feel the difference.

(my toxic trait of wanting more of tonkla and korn cause im LIVING their chemistry fukkkkkk)

i didnt expect tyme and great having sex this episode, i dont know, the timeline of their relationship is strange, i feel we barely see them interact this episode and also Tyme second agenda cause dude wants revenge, so is he really into great or just playing him?..

SPOILER: DEEPER THOUGHTS ON ONE SPECIFIC SCENE:

Now that I've found the ween, I am curious about Tyme/Great and their NC scene. It was so missionary - so boring - did Great even finish? Was it Tyme's first time with a man? It wasn't passionate at all - the opposite of what I would expect post-insane rescue mission. It was almost like Great was directing Tyme, not in it for himself at all.

Very diff from Ton/Win and not-first-time Ton/Korn.

The Tyme/Great scene was almost grounding them, stabilizing them vs revving things up.

GIVEN HOW much thought BOC gives and how many details there are, this can't be a coincidence.

figured out the spoiler issue - SORRY!!

Agreed it was boring and very much the OPPOSITE of ADRENALINE FUELED SEX. Not sure if Doc was doing it to calm Great down? I just rewatched it for the 5th time and I just don't know if maybe Jes was nervous AF and Bible has more experience in this realm and with Pond (Intimacy Director) but yes it definitely looked like Great was walking Tyme through this. I have had major adrenaline rushes where you are just insanely overstimulated laughing on the bed so I don't know how Great went directly from that to being super calm and a teacher of the art of sex. Maybe this was Tyme's first time with a man? The nurses said he had an ex girlfriend? Maybe Great does boys a lot so he was teaching Tyme the ways of the boys? I don't know but yes. I have been turning this over and over in my head and something doesn't fit. ü§î

Up until now, everything appeared 'normal'‚Äîif one can consider seeing four minutes into the future as normal. However, the revelation that Dome is Ton Kla's brother complicates matters significantly. He was the one Great was supposed to have rescued in episode 2 from Dome's kidnapper and future murderer, Title, yet he was found dead and cremated in this episode. This raises intriguing possibilities: Are we witnessing two parallel worlds, or are we experiencing Great's mind while he is in a coma, or perhaps during a heart attack?

The possibilty of parallel worlds or alternate realities suggests a narrative that may blur the lines between what is real and what could be imagined or altered by the characters' experiences.

But it can also be something different, I have untill now no idea. Do we see the events in the wrong order? That Dome is murdered after he had been saved by Great?

Ton Kla's fingerprints are all over the murderweapon of the unknown victim. How is Win going to handle that? He is madly in love with Ton Kla, how is he going to hide that evidence from his superiors?

Additionally, there‚Äôs the bribed chief of Win, who has taken over Dome's case. He seems to be under the influence of powerful individuals, and Win is being followed. Could Title's family be behind this? It hints at a deeper conspiracy, which raises questions about power dynamics and who is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

And what about Nam? Is she possibly Tyme's sister or another victim of Great's parents?

Thus far, this episode has left us with more questions than answers. It certainly pushes the boundaries of Thai BL, particularly with its daring portrayal of intimacy.

As a Dutch viewer, I find that seeing a man‚Äôs private parts in a TV series is not new to me; I witnessed such depictions quite often in the eighties, which now seems long past. However, it appears that Thai BL, or should I say BOC, has entered a boundary-breaking era.

Win is portrayed in a vulnerable light, and Ton Kla's experiences are depicted with raw honesty, including the intimate scenes. The tender deflowering of Ton Kla by Korn in happier times highlights their deep affection for one another they once had.

Moreover, the first encounter between Great and Tyme is particularly poignant, possibly marking their first experiences with a man. Tyme's concern for Great is evident in his gentle gestures‚Äîa peck on the forehead, a playful bite on the nose‚Äîfollowed by a moment of anticipation as he waits for Great to respond. Even then, Tyme's gaze remains attentive, ensuring that Great is alright, both in that moment and beyond.

Lukwa has been asked by dr. Den earlier from what aspect of life her ability to see 4 minutes in the future comes from, cause he explained that what patienst having seen in the moment when they had a cardiac arrest, depends on their beliefs, religion, experiences etc.

When she stopped by dr. Den to give him some food and also to answer that question, she has thought about it. She beliefs she was "in that place before". IThan you see her in a white room, it was in a art gallery and hear the explanation about 4 minutes, the time the brains can survive without oxygen. And the question what happens during that time to "our consciousness". Her question is if that is why she thinks she can see 4 minutes into the future, because of that number mentioned.

Dr. Den asks her when she was there but she can't remember exactly how and when she went in the art gallery. Vague memories. But, that she was not alone there, there was another person. In my opinion, that can be no one else than Great.

I did like an hour-long thought exercise last night of ‚Äúwhat if Dome lived, came home, and THEN was subsequently killed‚Äù but when I played that out it didn‚Äôt make sense that who murdered him would be such a mystery because they‚Äôd have a record of Dome‚Äôs hospital visit, Great taking him there and also being injured, and View‚Äôs police report of Title kidnapping her. There would be enough detail / people for Win to easily put together Title as a suspect. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the case that Dome lived, was released, and then was subsequently killed.

Are we witnessing two parallel worlds, or are we experiencing Great's mind while he is in a coma, or perhaps during a heart attack?

I feel like going 2 timelines is getting extremely messy, and it's more like one route where someone is exploring the alternative options. My current headcanon is that Great is dying and considering all the choices he made that led him here. Eg. He should have left the woman on the road, or he should have run past Tyme, he shouldn't have saved Nan etc

Ton Kla's fingerprints are all over the murderweapon of the unknown victim

Was that mentioned explicitly in the show? I didn't actually connect that, but we did see a scene of him bashing someone up. Could either be Title (for killing Dome), Korn (for stringing him along)...or even Dome. He did look a bit psycho when we saw the cat scene...

It might be Title, because the police mentioned that 2 people were killed the same way and it could be Title killing Dome and subsequently Tong Kla killing Title. Win then meets TK and gets the call that his fingerprints are on the rock.

Do we see the events in the wrong order? That Dome is murdered after he had been saved by Great?

I did wonder that, especially since they're so concerned with the time that they never show us dates. But I think it's a little too coincidental that he's killing him in the exact same place and location?

But, that she was not alone there, there was another person. In my opinion, that can be no one else than Great.

We've seen Great have that vision before I think? The fact that she realises he was there, were the 2 of them dying at the same time? Or do all these people with visions enter the same realm

So many questions, so little answers!

We can keep talking about the NC scenes but guys the theories! From what I've seen people believe that there are seperate timelines and Great is stuck in a different timeline and all. We will know about it more in the future coming eps. But my god the series is so good so far... Everything about it is phenomenal...

Waah kudos to the writers.. I'm loving the plot twistüòç

Also Bas needs to keep the hairstyle (that we see in the fbs) i mean he looks handsome (both ways)in that style even more..for me its always (hair down>hair up) ... Bas is doing amazing here‚ù§‚Äçüî•

Also not to be rude but enough with tonkla ncs (fuaiz needs a break from that many ncs..he's still a 19 yr old kid(i feel old üíÄ)..not to act like a moral police üíÄbut boc could've been a bit considerate of him or given him fast cut ncs more than this much explicit ncs) he feels like the main character tho (with complex storyline so let's dive into his brother's mystery?) He's also doing a great job

Bas fuaiz bed talk was wow they look so much in love üòçüòçi loved it (that soft fluffy moment)

I don't mind greattyme thoü§ìgive me more mystery along the way

Win(Jj) seems a bit heart broken

And Korn (situation is kinda sad) his business changed him completely.. he lost himself even more)..

I love this show tho‚ù§‚Äçüî•

Can someone explain what is happening with the boy that got beat up and put in hospital? Is that Tonkla's brother and there's two parallel universes... I'm so confused who Tonkla's brother is and how hospital boy fits in

Hospital boy is Dome. Yes that is Ton Kla's bro. I think he is a hallucination of Ton Kla. He is dead but Ton Kla is reimagining.

OMG !!!! Great episode!!! Just GREAT!!! I really love how they show the different aspects of the characters; every detail is a clue.
Since we are now sure we are dealing with different time lines, I will need tab to keep track XD if I think it's good enough I'll post it.

Yes please share!!! I am pretty positive the Cop at his office and the phone call happens later than we think because eventhough Cop helped at the funeral I don't see Ton Kla CALLING him just on a Tuesday morning.

I have to say, I am glad we got mad TonKla with Korn, most others will quick jump to the forgiveness but him kicking Korn out was perfect. I enjoy a good argument in series

All I have is questions...

Where is Title? Was he one of the dead bodies?

How did knowing Great's surname influence Tyme's desire to get to know/get close to Great? (Was he genuinely attracted to Great in the ER?) Since he hates Great's family, was his first goal to use Great somehow in his revenge? But then he reveals his face to Great (after going after Korn). And then Great helps him so I guess he's decided Great is OK after all?

For the Tyme/Great NC scene, I assume that Jes already has a big fandom from all of the het dramas he's made. It might be detrimental to his career to do full-on NC? Great's flashbacks seem more passionate than the one in this episode, but I won't be surprised if their NC scenes are never as full-on as Tonkla/Korn or Tonkla/Great. I liked the light-heartedness of this scene, and the developing connection. It might have been the first time (with a guy at least) for both of them?

My only issues with the all of the NC scenes so far is the timing... they are shot as though we see everything from start to finish. And yet the finish is within maybe 30 seconds? I like that they are semi-realistic. Tyme's sweat was the icing on the cake! But I would have preferred the illusion of longer sex scenes. A time skip for some prep? For getting comfortable? For enough blood to be diverted to the important places for an orgasm to have some basis in reality, lol.


Korn wants to prove himself to his father, and goes along with the illegal stuff... he hasn't commented on how he feels about it yet. He wanted Nan to be unhurt. But doesn't have the authority to ensure that, which says something about where the real power still is (his father).

I love how this series isn't wasting any time. Every scene, every interaction, is important.

I am caught up and obsessed with this show now. First off, my favorite is Ton Kla. Idk if people have been complaining about his screen time but I don‚Äôt care. I love seeing him on screen, he‚Äôs so interesting to me. Especially the way his dynamic shifts from Korn to Win. Ooooh he‚Äôs taking it. The look he gives Win just shows he has all the power in their relationship. I love to see it.

Besides that, I think he‚Äôs going to have a really important part in the future especially since I‚Äôm not sure what he‚Äôll do and what will go down when Korn finds out. The end scene though‚Ä¶ yup Dome is definitely his brother but I wonder what‚Äôs going on with the timeline? Cause we know Dome is dead from Ton Kla‚Äôs pov but up till that last scene he was still alive. Idk. I guess we‚Äôll have to see.

Also yay, for GreatTyme getting together this ep (at least physically lol).

Here we go, my incoherent thoughts and reactions as I watch this right now:

So it‚Äôs P‚ÄôMor and Nan, but why and how I wonder. Oooh well that wasn‚Äôt a surprise at all was it. Tyme trying to get back at Great‚Äôs family.

Ok I‚Äôm certain now Tonkla and Tyme will team up to get revenge, because Korn killed Tonkla‚Äôs little brother. (or Korn‚Äôs people did, who cares)

Weirdly enough, the uncut version is now searchable in Viu in my territory (Indonesia). But, it says that you'd need Viu Premium+ (not just the regular Premium), and the only way to get it is by contacting their customer service. I vaguely remember Premium+ being available "over-the-counter" a month ago, so I assume they're doing ID check now (I haven't actually done it). I guess it's all because of this show? I don't see anything else even remotely sexual.

I have so many questions üò´ is Tonkla in the other timeline where Dome was killed by title or did Great taking Dome to the hospital not save him and he‚Äôs in some kind of purgatory? Or are the timelines converging since Great is changing so many things. Ngli have a feeling we are heading to a sad ending for our main couple. Tonkla finally got what he wanted and Win is so pathetically in love with this boy üò≠

I am still piecing together theories on this. I feel like I'm going to have to rewatch everything once it ends to see how it fits. I think I'm watching multiple linear timelines, and they connect somehow....we just haven't gotten to that point yet, like there is a gap in the before and after or the parallel.

The NC scenes are so informative, I feel like we get a lot of emotional feedback from how they all interact with one another. I will not complain about the Great Tyme scene... I feel like it came across as natural even if it was missing something, idk? The tenderness was not something I was expecting to see given all the other NC scenes thus far. I think their kissing scenes are very well done, its definitely a visual feast!! Thighs tattoos on a man in an intimate setting is something I've never seen in person. I must say, it was sexy! The check-ins, the physical touch, eye contact... came across as soft and vulnerable even though it felt slightly detached for me towards the end, but I liked that about it. I feel like it was deliberately done.

I'm going to watch Ep 5 tomorrow. CAN'T WAIT! I have a feeling that Korn is going to catch Tonkla and Win together at some point, and I am not sure if I am ready to see how that falls out. So much to anticipate!
