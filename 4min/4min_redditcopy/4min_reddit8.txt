My brain was actually screaming during that scene. Not only because it looked so fucking cool and Bible looked so pretty with that neon light on his face, but I was like "DOES THIS MEAN HE'S DEAD????"

awww, I loved that. Great ending, imo. So the "4 minutes experience" turned Great into an actual angel - the *only* law abiding citizen, and Tyme into more of a realist - sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do type of brotha. The "Why Don't You Stay" cover was so good and so gaggy and it still gives me chills. üò©

As it zoomed out, it looked like the second hand on the watch, and then it faded completely to black at 12. But I'm NOT reading anything into that, because I finally saw the canoe shot, and I want a happy ending.

I took that shot to be one that was going with the theme of the show - clocks have featured heavily throughout.

But also I think that the watch scene was saying quite clearly that they're alive. First of all, '4 minutes' would actually end when the watch hits 4, not 5 (lol). But also, I think the watch hitting 5 was meant to send a clear message, unlike say, Inception which ended ambiguously.

But if you want outside-the-universe confirmation, Sammon's tweet seems to confirm that they are alive, to me.

For the l√±ongest time I thought they were gonna Inception us. They almost did. But I liked the ending a lot. There's still hope although not for everyone. My heart ached when Great was be happy with the one you love to Korn.

I'm not a fan of under water kisses but the whole sequence with the sunscreen??? That is product placement at its finest. And it was so SO BEAUTIFULLY SHOT.

I am a sobbing mess between the montage at the beginning, 'Why Don't You Stay', the meaning in the outcome of the show and just thinking about everything that Bible has gone through.

I'll have more coherent thoughts later but yeah. üò≠ In so many ways it's hard to believe that we're finally at this day, at the finale. Bible cried talking about it and it reminds me of all the pressure and all the expectations that have been on his shoulders, both from others and from himself. I'm so proud of him and the entire cast, they knocked it out of the park.

Edit:

Coming back here hours later now that I am a bit coherent to say that I really love how beautifully the two pairs/triad were used to illustrate the poignancy of the concept of '4 Minutes'.

Great and Tyme seemed to be hurtling towards certain doom - and in fact were - and had nothing but their own decisions to blame for it. Great lived a life of passivity, avoiding decision making and responsibility, caring for very little, not even himself. Tyme was consumed by revenge, so much so that he was willing to do just about anything to accomplish it, even if it meant pulling in someone who had done him no harm (setting Great's other issues aside) by using them for his own ends.

Then 4 Minutes happens and each of them gets to reconsider those decisions. Tyme chooses a world where he isn't consumed by pain and revenge, a world where he is a better doctor and kinder to his girlfriend when breaking things off. He chooses a world where Great comes to him and the two of them are actually blissfully, sweetly happy with each other, a world where he holds Great safely in the circle of his arms rather than sending him off into danger and perhaps to his death.

In the meantime, Great chooses a world where he doesn't take the passive way out - instead he chooses to take responsibility, to intervene, to try and do the right thing even if it means putting himself in danger. He chooses a world where sex isn't meaningless and he can have a moment with Tyme, even if it's just temporary. He chooses a world where he's a hero instead of a coward.

And then - against all odds - they get their second chance. To be together, to take responsibility. To make a different choice (Tyme leaving the father alive rather than killing him). To move forward and make the best of a future they didn't expect to have.

In contrast, Korn, Win and Tonkla are a mess of toxic love and obsession. Tonkla is failed by society, but also by Korn and Win. Korn discovers that Tonkla isn't the man that he thought he was, in more ways than one, and Win realizes that maybe Tonkla was using him more than he thought. And in Korn's final moments we get a glimpse of what I think was his 4 Minutes, where he chooses to run away with Tonkla - except unlike Tyme and Great, there is no second chance for him. The clock ticks on and he dies alongside the man he loved. The beauty of Tyme and Great's story stands out against the contrasting darkness of Korn, Win and Tonkla and I really think it's quite something how Sammon used the two storylines to play off of each other, and how the backdrop of the tragedy of their story makes Tyme & Great's second chance more poignantly sweet, even though they're going to face so much difficulty.

ugh if I'm not careful I'm going to start crying again, lol. I really think that the entire cast knocked it out of the park, here. Bible did an absolutely phenomenal job, as did Bas, Fuaiz and Jjay, but I think everyone was amazing - not just the main cast, but also everyone in the secondary roles, too. I'm so grateful to Jes for being at Bible's side through all of this as it takes someone strong to step into this role after all of the drama, and be willing to face everything that would come his way from the fandom. I really hope that we get to see more of BibleJes going forward as I think the two of them have developed a really strong rapport with each other.

At any rate, it's been a wild ride and in a lot of ways it's hard to believe that we got to this day, but I've really enjoyed the whole experience of it even with the ups and downs from week to week.

And this is the end. I really like how they showed one simple decision can change an entire story.
In Tyme fantasy, he just chooses not to read his mother dairy and he got a nice life with a super cute romance with Great without drama or death.

As for Great, his life is a mess, whatever choices he makes, showing how immature he can be. That actually helped him to realize his faults and rectify what he could after his life-threatening experience.

Am I the only one who got scared to death on the boat scene to get a ending like DFF ?! Also the use of Jeff Satur song of KP ! Nice easter egg !

I have a controversial opinion about the Ton and Korn relationship; yes, Korn groomed Ton to his liking, and we really can debate if he sincerely loves Ton at some point, but I think they are in a codependent relationship; when he's at his bottom, Korn always seems to go to Ton, and I think back in their university days he genuinely
wanted to elope with Ton at some point. So even if we can debate about his last action as a way to escape his overall situation, I really think deep down that he really couldn't go on without Ton.

We got justice for Den!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway, here is my last diagram of the series; I will miss making those!

Well and there it was the ending!
I was actually expecting a more bloody ending with all of them dead but I definitely wasn't shocked when Tonkla and Korn died, I was pretty much waiting for that to happen.
Seriously, give a series where Fuaiz character doesn't die at the end (cuz his character also died in Dead Friend Forever) -.-
P.S. - Another underwater kiss for BL history :D

BoC's Cinematography
All during the last third, I was mentally screaming "TAKE YOUR SHIRTS OFF". Not for hotness, but because I wanted to see if they had gunshot scars. I was expecting it to be a fake out the whole time, so I was very tense during the end because I was expecting them all to be dead. I'll have to watch the end again now that I know that they made it out.

But DID they? Whooooo is that lady running the art exhibition??? The held shot on her after Lukwa left was really ominous. Right now I'm choosing to believe they did survive, but there is a chance when the clock ticked past 4 Minutes, they died and the boat drone shot was them dead and in heaven.

Though, nobody else did. Jesus. Can JJay get a break? Is he doomed to always kill his true love? BoC, everyone loves JJayFuiaz - put them in a show where they can actually be happy. I do love the angst, though. They are so damn good at it.

I can see why they said it was a bittersweet end. Tyme and Great did end up together (maybe), but it's not like they aren't going to have hurdles. I'm not sure how many years the Thai system gives for accessory after the fact for murder, but where he's co-operative (and can be valuable in his knowledge of the illegal casino stuff and how he helped expose that politician), they are going to be separated for at least a few years. He also lost EVERYTHING, but that life had been a shackle to him.

Korn fucking went THROUGH IT. Tongkla was just digging that knife deeper and deeper. Bas did an incredible acting job in this episode.

If you are near death, PLEASE make sure that pre-Tyme Great isn't anywhere near you. Fucking HELL man, that's almost another person that you just let die. You had your phone RIGHT THERE, MAN. That was another part where I was expecting them all to be dead and I would have been so sad that Lukwa and Den didn't have their happy ending.

Honestly, I'd be kind of hardcore down for a Fasai centric show where she goes out for revenge for the person who did this to her father (and make it a GL where evil people are doing evil things and they are just bad people all around)

Wow you guys I'm so blown away, this finale was PERFECTION! Can't believe they wrapped up everything so neatlyüôè It's a 10/10 for me and the ending in the boat and the KP song was the cherry on top!

And yes there is LOVE AND ROMANCE AND YES WE'RE ALIVE AND NOT STUCK IN THE LOOP ü•π (well RIP Tonkla, but at least you got üç£, revenge and your mans back. RIP Korn, you had a great üçë and you were a beautiful crier)

Dafuq!? There was a huge lump on my chest the first 16 minutes of the episode üò≠üò≠ because of Great and Tyme

Then, I went on to hold my breath because of Korn and TonKla üò≠üò≠ 30 minutes in and I'm a mess. I didn't know I was rooting this HARD for Korn and TonKla.



And this episode affirmed to me that Great was a P.O.S before his 4 minutes.

Now, I want to go canoodle in a canoe with my beau.

I didn't know I needed "Why Don't You Stay" rendition by Jes.

Well, I like it when a series neatly ties all loose ends in a pretty little bow and 4 Minutes did just that. Great and Tyme are less evil and less saintly than I feared, t everyone got what they deserved, I am content.

Huge thank you to the cast and crew who delivered. This is a great series, and Be On Cloud continues to serve the industry with higher standards in the cinematography, acting, directing, even setting the bar for bloody product placement and I hope all other studios and companies are sat down and taking notes furiously!

I'm wondering if there is going to be a twist with Den's research, like they were just case studies the whole time or something? The socmed accounts made a post a while back specifically focusing on Den's work and if there was a hidden meaning there....

Also, what's going to happen with Tongkla and Korn?? Is Tongkla going to kill Korn? Is Korn going to kill Tongkla? Is Korn secretly glad that Tongkla shot Great?

So much said here already. Loved it. Loved it a lot.
Not sure if the end was real or not but it was satisfying. The Jeff's song, the kiss underwater, the soft beautiful kisses ... everything just dreamlike.

Finally, an ending that I don't feel annoyed.

The only cliche though ... the interrupted kiss üêà‚Äç‚¨õ ü§£ü§£

I loved the ending ‚ò∫Ô∏è I‚Äôm happy that GreatTyme remember their moments during 4minutes and it was a valuable experience for both of them. They got me nervous in the last few minutes thinking they are gonna make Dff type of ending but luckily the watch has gone past 4 minutes ü§£ I also loved their little romantic moments during Tyme‚Äôs 4min, it was sooo cute (another pool kiss!)

Having said all that, I cried my eyes out during Tonkla and Korn‚Äôs scene. You could see that they truly loved each other despite everything they‚Äôve doneüíî

My applause to all the creators of this show üëèüèª The writing, directing, acting, cinematography- everything was top-notch. I gonna miss 4minutes a lot

Can we please discuss the whole thing.It was like the best thing produced and presented to us. As a BL fan this kind of series is iconic and I don't think anything can match this series Even though Ton khla died, I was devastated but still it was a masterpiece to be honest.

I keep reading how you guys are upset by Tonkla and Korn dying when all I thought was, yes, it‚Äôs sad, but it makes complete sense. These two would never have had a happy ending, they would have broken up eventually, and that was my best case scenario for both. Let‚Äôs be honest, Ton kla is a very cute but very psychotic serial murderer who used both Korn and Win to his advantage and if he ever had any deep feelings for Korn, I‚Äôm not sure these were really all there by the end. Korn is a weak accessory to murder, torture, gambling and whatnot who dropped everything like a hot potato at the first sign of struggle and Win became a corrupt policeman after all because of his desire for Ton kla. He would SO have let this man escape, we all know this.

I'll miss this brilliant series and the on air thread theories. The whole time I was waiting for a DFF style twist. The scenes with Great and Tyme were very romantic, they are beautiful together. I don't know why, but I wasn't as invested in their ending. Maybe because it was obvious they would end up together? Maybe too much guitar and not enough making out? I don't know.

Now Ton and Korn are a different story. Was it love? I think so in their own twisted way but regardless they were so good on screen together, omg that kiss! Their tragic, violent ending made sense for them even though I wanted them to be on the run forever. The Kinnporche nostalgia at the end was beautiful. I need more psychological BLs like this.

 Stay With Me
I cannot wait to read the variety of opinions on the ending and the series as a whole. I imagine it will be WILDLY DIVISIVE and I can't wait to read the rants and raves. 

I personally wound up really like 4 Minutes while completely understanding why others may not AND agreeing with many criticisms of it. 

MY FAVORITE CHARACTER: Korn

UGH the way I love a flawed, morally dark grey, sad boy who cries. It may be a problem. I think Korn WANTED to be a good guy but didn't have the courage to be. I think he genuinely loved Kla but was weak, selfish, and scared. He tried to live up to his family's expectations, feeling pressure as the eldest, but was just bad at it. He was bad at being good and bad at being bad but superb at fucking up and being alone, lost, and confused. I think emotionally, in terms of how alone he felt with no place to turn, not feeling proud of his actions but not knowing what to do, regretting too late how he treated the people he loved -- I related most to Korn.I wonder how dark my grey is. Huh. WORRYING.

MY FAVORITE TYMExGREAT: Tyme's

OG, Pre-4M Tyme and Great weren't really in love and had ill-timed bathroom breaks. I liked their chemistry at the noodle spot but it didn't go anywhere. 

Great's Tyme and Great were lacking in scorching hot chemistry and were too awkward for me, I didn't like the virginal, awkward bro vibe.  

Post 4Minutes Tyme and Great were actually pretty good, still had a bit of bro energy but I felt their connectedness. Not bad.

Tyme's version though -- just right for me. Maybe because it was just a montage and they didn't ruin it by, like, talking, but they had a flirty, romantic, loved up vibe that was neither without heart nor with too much awkward energy. The spooning was divine. They seemed at ease and I believed them as a romantic pair. Plus the montage left me wanting more, so that made me feel like maybe in the right circumstances, which will never happen in any universe of multi-verses, Jes and Bible could have been a great couple. The dream is kept alive for me. 

MY FAVORITE ACTOR: Bas

I felt like Bas had fantastic microexpressions that made me understand his inner conflict and his love for Kla. However, they must have been waaaaay too micro, because so many folks didn't pick up on them and see him as a jerk to the end. So maybe Bas wasn't all that great if we're not all seeing the same thing or maybe that's just the nature of the kind of character Korn was. But for me, Bas played a difficult character really well, and his final scene made me cry. I was heartbroken for him, which, you know, maybe this is  more about my terrible taste in men than anything else. 

MY FAVORITE SCENE: Tyme Stitching Great (Great ver)

At the end of the day, this scene -- while basically a complete scam and a total lie, as we did not see this chemistry develop later in Great's ver -- was the most enjoyable moment. It made me giggle, it brought my expectations up, it made me feel chemistry and flirtatiousness. It was well done. It was total bait and I resent it in many ways, but as a standalone scene, it was a feel-good scene that made me feel butterflies.

My second favorite scene was Kla and Korn's last scene -- from Kla's admission, to Win's patheticness, to Korn's breakdown, I felt that while cliche, it was Shakespearean Tragic in a good way, and I really liked it. I know others hated it beyond belief and I do not disagree -- cliche, tired, lame on many levels. For me, I don't mind a cliche and I thought it was a good use of a cliche tragic ending.

MY LEAST FAVORITE MOMENT; Tyme and Great NC Scene - OG ver

This was a scene I was really looking forward to, I thought we were going to see two people truly attracted to each other, connected in an unexplained way, longing for closeness, overwhelmed by passion. We got NONE of that and I remain pissed. I will never get over how we were baited here. This was about selling us a lie in teasers and I think Jes had some contract about showing off only good sides of himself and it was ABSOLUTELY DISINGENUOUS and I cannot release my rage over it. 

My second least favorite moment was Tyme and Great's NC scene in Great's ver, I am just not a fan of awkward, embarrassed, virginal sex scenes.

I love your take on Korn! He was a really interesting character. And definitely kudos to Bas for portraying him so well. The thing that broke my heart the most was that at his lowest point, Korn finally felt free to pursue what he really wanted (no longer being afraid and wanting to run away with Ton Kla), except it was much, much too late.

Also kudos to Bible for portraying what felt like three different versions of Great - the one in Great's head, the one in reality and the one in Tyme's head. The one in Tyme's head is definitely the most sweet and charming version, which makes sense given that Tyme is falling in love, but all this to say I loved the version of them in Tyme's head the most, too. It was the first time I thought I really wish we got more of them together on this show. Their chemistry was impeccable there.

I agree with almost all your points. Loved Bas/Korn. I do think on the awkward Nc scene from Great‚Äôs 4 minutes, it‚Äôs truly meant to be SO awkward. Because Great is a big baby and had never been in love before and actually fell for Tyme. So he envisioned this childish awkward moment when trying to fix it. I didn‚Äôt like it until their real NC scene and then seeing Tyme‚Äôs version‚Ä¶.it all came together for me. And honestly, I‚Äôll take any version of Jes and Bible because dear god, they are attractive men and don‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm watching little boys like some of these shows do. IDK, I understand why people are mad about that ep 4 scene, but for me it showed so much about Great and the story.

My heart stopped when they stared at the watch by the end. Not sure if they're awake or not. Inception style. Ugh

Anyways. Do we know if Jes and Bible will be a couple in another show or.. Bible will keep doing BL with different ppl? This was way too short and I need more Bible. Stat. üò≠

If Great and Tyme did survive, what a tragic end to Tonkla and Korn.

Ugh, so we have an open ended ending like Dead Best Friend Forever. !<

I had forgotten about the art exhibition woman, and I'd thought they did get out, but maybe the clock ticking past the four minutes means they truly are dead and in heaven where they can finally be happy? I DON'T KNOW. Right now, that's what I'm choosing to believe.

I liked the ending. Whether it was real or not, at least one couple is probably happy somewhere. Maybe both - one in the real world and one in the afterlife. Much better than the bloodbath I was expecting.

Tyme redoing his meeting with Great was just so sweet and heart breaking. It was apparent how much he wanted a healthy rs and treasure Great if things went differently

I am not okay! The happiness montage/ending to Why Don‚Äôt You Stay from KinnPorsche omg üò≠ that song makes me want to cry on a good day but paired with this finale damn üò≠ I was expecting a really sad ending so pleasantly surprised with what we got. Never getting over Ton Kla and Korn, I was unexpectedly wrecked there.

That was really excellent stuff though. It was unpredictable and had me throughly gripped!

I was confused until the end but from what I got, this was a story about near death experiences and that there were no actual powers. The real power was both of them inventing having a romance in their own 4 minutes. ü§£ü§£ Though I can't say I'm completely satisfied with this ending. Maybe it needed a few more eps to completely tie everything up

Overall, it was a great series, JesBible had insane chemistry, I hope they do a repeat project together. But the star of the show was definitely Sammon's writing. This is already her 4th live action BL and she still out here doing queen stuff. I am now massively hyped for the upcoming Spare Me Your Mercy.

Ok. My question from last week still stands. In ep 3 Tyme tells Den about his friend seeing 4 minutes into the future. In ep 4 Den tells his female patient about it. So either:

Great's dying brain conjured a perfect image of a person that he never met (Den)

Those scenes were shown out of order. In which case, the riddle was presented in a way that makes it impossible to solve.

Tsk, tsk. I'm not even going to dive into Tonkla seeing his brother's ghost in that one scene.

Is this series worth watching in the end? I think it is, but I'll say something opposite to what I usually feel after finishing a bl - I wish the writers were less ambitious with their script. I would rather take more conventional explanation that makes complete sense, rather than super convoluted one that explains everything in 95%.

It's just one writer, Sammon, and she's given some explanation which you can read here (which Thoughts also links above). But you will find that it's not a conventional explanation. Given Sammon's explanation - that the "4 Minutes Universe" is a kind of special dimension - she makes allowances for impossibilities. If you're not aware, Sammon is a medical doctor and her scripts often go deep into medical science. However, in both 4M and a past series, Triage, she inserts some "supernatural" or "beyond known reality" elements that play with fate, time, and regret.

Just a quick question, if Great was actually shot by TonKla why is it that we saw another image of Great dying with his mother and not in the elevator ? I find it strange to show a bit of his 4Minutes at this moment of ep (16'48") ?

Also Great went to the police about Dome's murder but do you think he told about the hit and run too ? Or was that already delt with, I don't remember...

And we were sooo fooled about the actual exhibition üòÇüòÇ Nice job !

Overall, this show calls for a binge rewatching, I will definitly need to schedule that somehow

It's because it's thanks to Tyme that Great regain consciousness. At this moment they are both having heart attack and experiencing their 4-minutes AT THE SAME TIME, that's why we see Great shot with his mom. Tyme saves Great by calling his name!

I think the reason we saw the image of Great dying with his mother was that that was the last thing that happened in Great‚Äôs ‚Äúfake‚Äù world. Episode 5 ends with him and his mother dying. Similarly, Tyme‚Äôs ‚Äúfake‚Äù world is ending at that moment, so that‚Äôs why the shot of Great and his mom bleeding out at the same time Tyme is banging on the door. I think. ü§î

I had the same thought about Great's dying scene. Thought that was a bit strange and potentially confusing if one doesn't remember everything clearly x) Maybe even the editors got mixed up with the two timelines and put in the wrong death scene haha

So should I finish this or no? 

I quit watching during episode 6 and decided to wait for it to end because I wasn't really enjoying it. The only characters I was rooting for at that point were Win, Den, Tonkla, and nurse Bee.

I really loved Triage. The end was frustrating but not enough to ruin it. I loved DFF until the end which completely soured me on the entire show. I should have stopped that one on a high note. 

What do?

If you want ask me questions and I can answer (unless you want me to spoil it). I will say the end scene made a lot of people panic that it was similar to the end scene in DFF but thankfully it was not.

Ask me any questions or tell me how much you want me to tell you.

Ok the whole scene starting where TonKla tells Korn he shot Great and then ending with Korn shooting himself. Wow! So well done!! The way they faded out the sound and everything. The acting from Bas! One of the best scenes in the show for me personally, because it was done so well!

That's exactly what I thought!! I literally warned them that I would throw hands if they don't wrap the last episode respectfully and they got scared y'all üòå

DAMN that was a ride ...my bacteria brain finally understood the series like there are still some stuff that I was confused about like I don't remember seeing warit killing wanchai -literally don't even know who that is- and am I the only one that literally doesn't know where this warit guy popped out from?? Like maybe they explained it but I missed it but like literally out of nowhere he popped and they didn't specify if he was a family friend or a relative..etc and tell me why I gasped when I realised that girl (I think her name was fah) who wanted Korn was his daughter???? She was right???üò≠üò≠üò≠ Anyways 

My heart ached for our poor kla who literally could never properly feel loved without there being death and blood involved ...and it hurt even more when Korn realised that there isn't a life without him...like at that moment he didn't think about his brother that he loved so much or the business or his father that he tried so hard to satisfy, he just chose his lover WHICH HE SHOULD HAVE FROM THE BEGINNING üò≠üò≠. I was skeptical at first like I thought he was over kla but after that scene where the girl tells him to choose between her or kla and he gets up and like takes a deep struggling breathe making a very hard expression like he wanted to just break down at the thought of doing that to kla I was like my Man is on the verge of StrUgGLInG.

THE ENDING Jeff satur song MADE ME REMEMBER KINNPORSCHE that was such a suprise früò≠üò≠üò≠

 UGH it will take me 50 million years to get over this ...until I watch all the interviews and read all the reviews I shall seek justice for our tonkorn couple in my heart!! 

Also that 4 minutes story was Hella well done, confusing but well done

The series is about how both Great (Bible) and Tyme (Jes) imagined re-doing their recent pasts and fixing mistakes they regretted, while in real life they were flatlining and their brains were running out of oxygen.

When they both came back to life from flatlining ‚Äî Tyme because Den yelled at him to wake up, Great because Tyme reached out to him through his own mind ‚Äî they realized they had a romantic connection with each other and they both became better versions of themselves.

Was that what you didn‚Äôt understand?

I got not all my predictions right, only that Ton Kla would die and that Win would be left heart broken.

But than there came that scene at the lake, it reminded me of DFF.

I was like, not again a ending that seems happy but in fact, all are dead?

So, i was glad it turned 11.05. And I thought that Great really had turned his life around, just because of the 4 minutes experience. And both are happy ever after.

Untill i read that they both are allso death? What I predicted last week, but I don't need to be right.

I prefer them alive!

Edit: I watched that scene again. And i think i did not pay enough attention to what they said. "That means in the real world, you knew this place already exist, right?"

So, Tyme says that in their 4 minutes they experience things and surroundings that are familiar, so Great must know this lake from when he was in real time. And Great says, no, never been here, I just drove randomly in my 4 minutes to here!

They actually want to be in their 4 minutes. And are glad that it got 11.05, so they are going to stay there in a happier place, but that means that they are dead.

This show is making me mental. First I thought, they both have changed so much for the better, Great not a egoistic person, but is caring. And Tyme is now a doctor, who has bedside manners.

And that all because of their 4 minutes experience.

But now i am thinking totally different.

And still not sure now, second edit of this comment, cause in the end Tyme says "I thought we had not come out yet'. So, if i follow that, this is the real life.

I think something that people are missing is that the '4 minutes' would end when the watch hit 4, not 5. So going to 5 definitely means that they are alive, imo.

Plus if you read Sammon's tweet it kind of backs up the idea that they are alive, but going strictly by canon I think they were being very clear that they are indeed alive. They remember their 4 Minutes and that's how they go to the lake, even if we don't know how/why Great discovered the lake in the first place.

Binge-watching this in one day lol. I‚Äôm just glad that I waited for this series to finish before watching it. Also it is best to watch it without any spoilers. It was not that complicated tbh as long as you pay attention to the dialogues and the scenes. If you are still very confuse about the timeline just go to recent discussions segment on MDL. Someone provided detail explanations, it was a good read.

I‚Äôm proud of myself because I mostly guessed everything‚Äôs right (my brain is still braining thank god). Although ngl the ending almost giving me heart attack. I thought they gonna pulled some DFF on us (hello trauma my old friend, got me there Sammon). Korn and Tongkla ending kinda appropriate for them because I don‚Äôt see how they gonna end this ‚Äòhappily‚Äô given their current situations.

Overall it was a very very very good series ü§ß. The acting (everyone slayyy), the beautiful cinematography, the ost (Why don‚Äôt you stay cover by Jes, literally chills guys) everything was chef‚Äôs kiss.

Also they did not hold back with the sexy scenes gosh (blessed) my eyes. I think I‚Äôm in love (again) with Bible and thank you for Jes!!?? Whoever casted and paired him up with Bible needs a raise!! Their chemistry üî•üî•

Well atleast they gave us a clear happy ending unlike dff

But one plothole from Great's 4 mins timeline(Great's mom killed by the lady that met with accident) they just forgot her completely nd unexplained(I'll consider it his manipulated memory.. Coincidence like the river scene when they were in a location from his 4 mins)

Tymegreat got their happy ending... But Great in real life is a real coward huh?? Did not call the ambulance for Den's gf (when she had heart attack) //killed a lady by accident //accomplice to Dome's murder(atleast he got jail time for that) // did not help Nan... So the fourhub (was the reality lol)... Atleast he did not let his parents come back

Tyme did a good job (disabling Fahsai's dad aka Warit) üíÄi liked his revenge mentality ü§ìalso his 4 mins was the cutest... (Tymegreat romance was top notch in this ep... Wow so cute‚ù§nd natural)

Also they killed my fav ship/characters üòìüòìüòìüòìüòìüòì...

My dear Korn... He just used Fahsai also called upon the partner's daughter(that Warit /fahsai killed for korn) he snitched on them as revenge lol..

And i didn't know Korn liked Tonkla that much üò∂‚Äçüå´üò∂‚Äçüå´üò∂‚Äçüå´sigh.. He unalived himself... Blamed himself for whatever tonkla did üò≠üò≠üò≠(tonkla killed his dad too stop it Korn u didn't make him go villain mode).. Both tonkla nd korn got their romeo/juliet end sigh*(Bas crying made me sad... Wow the actor that he is... He's phenomenal alongside Fuaiz dark confession to Korn...both Bas nd Fuaiz got all my attention in this show... Wow i love their acting üëçso talented)... Bas really lived the character in the end.. üòç

Also Tonkla who did he even love in the end like?? I'm confused he stopped Korn from shooting Win and died getting shot by Win.. I'll presume he loved Korn in the end üò∂‚Äçüå´sigh*

Korn even was ready to runaway nd help Tonkla üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠(here i thought he came running to Tonkla because Fahsai rejected him).. He even committed suicide. Aaaahhh oh my Korn (my fav character üò≠died)

Also Win was unemotional. Like wtf he shot Tonkla but still standing there with his poker justice face üíÄüíÄüíÄreasoning with tonkla....did he even love tonkla ??i guess he likes his job more..sigh*..

It was 9.5 for me... Butt reducing. 5 for that plothole/not explaining(reason for great's mom shooting) . So overall 9/10. .. For me

They made it into a bl by the end üòÇ.. Atleast Greattyme are happyüëçgoodbye to 4 mins... It was fun.. I love this show... Cinematography/quality was top notch... Good job BoCüëç‚ù§

My theory, I think both of them are dead. The scene at the infinite lake and the two of them lying in the canoe is a metaphor for passing to the afterlife. Along with Great's comment, "Why are we here if I didn‚Äôt know this place?" seem like clues that they are dead, but together in afterlife. After Tonkla and the brother‚Äôs death, everything happens very quickly. We don't see how they recover, nor the direct consequences. The following scenes seem to take place in another dimension, and although we know that Great goes to jail, the series curiously ends with that unsettling scene. Really, the ending scene is so unsettling, I want to cry because everything makes sense. I won't believe they are alive unless BOC deliver a special episode

Can someone please explain it to me like I‚Äôm five - why did it matter that they had never been to the lake before? Why did that fact make them think they were still in the 4 minutes?

When they were in the canoe, they were thinking about their times in the "4 Minutes alternate universe" they each lived in while they were near brain death.

Tyme was wondering how did the place they were now in, in the real world, show up in Great's "4 minutes alternate universe" if Great had never been there until this moment in the canoe. Essentially, If you had never been to a place, how could you imagine it perfectly in a dream? Great did not have an answer to that. He did not know how he had pictured a place perfectly that he had never been to.

Given there was no explanation and it seemed improbable (to picture a place perfectly that you had never been to), it made them both suspicious they were actually not in reality. It's like a moment you personally may have experienced in a dream where you realize "wait a minute, this doesn't make sense...am I dreaming?" so they worried they were still trapped in the "alternate universe".

Well Sammon predictably gave them the happy ending...coward...and the other was so cliche it was almost painful. It was so figgin convoluted that it was borderline nonsensical. I'm just unhappy with the whole mess of this series. Next Sammon series I go in with 0 expectations.

I loved the viusals of this, I think the BoC boys killed it, but the writing was not capable of keeping up.

I'm with you. This show is NOT well made.

Storytelling art is making complicated storylines easy to follow.

What they did here was the opposite - make a medium complicated setup a fucking messy pile of random scenes you kinda have to wade through and nobody who doesn't read "secondary" sources can realistically follow.

As always, the first couple episodes were cool and intriguing, but the second half what a complete shit show.
