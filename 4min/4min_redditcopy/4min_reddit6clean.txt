sup dad
im screaming


i dont know why but this scene took me out i almost spat out my matcha  bible and his english strikes again

literally i wasnt paying attention and then when i heard it i was choking 


the way he just casually sup broed his dad when they were just beefing dad was like im not your bro with that paper toss lol

i wish he knew before he went in to see his dad cause i wanted his to be sassy about it lolol

tea

when i saw this is was like you know what i like this version of him like for a slight second in this scene i thought he was vegas again cause damn  he wanted it on of 

ikr i literally screamed that his vegas is showing

hes such a hot bitch i love it 


hes drinking a negroni is this now the official drink for hot messes in thai bl
this whole scene and the switch of the dynamic was truly phenomenal 

4 minutes will go down in history 

the unexpected tenderness tho even great was shooketh 


thats why he was obsessed afterwards no one in their right mind goes back for more after revenge porn

yeah he was dickmatized in a loving way and that was probably a first

jes uploading this episode to viu and gaga himself 


he is competing with you 

omggg the lifthop up and crawl 

its going down in the bl history books if only they had continued to the end there


that bathroom break pissed me off did great go to douche or something

he definitely went to prepare but its the one time we dont want realism 
on a pool table  with the 4
screaming tbh this great characterization fits the way he dresses and his lifestyle a lot more than the dreamy version great wants for himself


a thousand percent now the clothes match
i brightened up this part specifically 


need to do a taste test of the goods first never skip this step
help me jesus

this is what enjoying the bible is all about



i am at work and unfortunately cannot watch till later im walking outside on my lunch break and stopped dead in my tracks at this good lord they are gonna kill me 

it seems like thats pponds mission 
i love how peeps thought fuaiz was doing the edgier scenes because hes young and dumb and new and boc is taking advantage of him etc but ppond cackled and said we all float down here billy boy bible is gonna let yall know real soon 
im actually getting really hype for shine mileapo are gonna go scorched earth 

literally expected bible to shake his hair out like a pantene commercial 


they lost their chance for shampoo product placement
cmon people leverage what youve got
not a gigantic marble lazy susan the wealthy just live different 


it is such a weird setup
nobody can reach the center of the table the cleaning staff probably dusts it using a swiffer to reach the center
marble is a terrible material for dining tables it is easily scratched and very porous the porous nature makes it soak up stains like a sponge the process for removing stains from marble is quite involved you need to make a poultice mixture that has both liquid and solid components the liquid component penetrates the marble to dissolve the stain the solid component needs to be more absorbent than the marble to draw everything back out


me reading this detailed explanation of marble maintenance

i can do it with a broken heart
i love how i can learn something competently random in the unlikeliest places

just impractical rich people nonsense doing stuff because they can 

ppond said why yes i am a qaf stan tyme taking a bite out of crime screaming 
tyme you nasty for this but lmao  all greats condoms meanwhile ton wats to be bred 247 

ton is a raw food connoisseur 

you know how we have pdeeeeaaaaannnnnn until we meet again and hiiiaaaaaaaa both cutie pie and between us now i will never hear the word raw without thinking of tonklas sex scenes anymore even when im eating sushi ill be thinking of him

bocs cinematography
omg i fucking love this soooo so so many people say i would never do that in this situation and think they would be a big hero in whatever tragedy they read about in the news but they never would be great was seeing visions of himself as being a good person but we see that he wasnt hes a murderer and an accomplice to a second murderer everyone wants to be the hero in their own story and will lie to themselves about it wow great is such a grey complex character
okay so why does jet look so hot splattered in blood titles a fucking dick but still heyyyyyy
jes and bibles ass curves could crumble empires jesus
i love that great was turned on that tyme was trying to fuck over his father
you let someone die because of your cowardice correction great let 3 people die because of his cowardice
okay so what was korn doing when tyme was first spying on him he definitely was doing something that involved bloodshed
through the whole episode i was wondering how tongklas story was going to fit into this damn
mannnnnnnnnnn now i need to go back and watch all the other episodes because this gives new context to everything its just like dff all over again how is mr ascot going to fit into this
omg here we goooooooo

i can do it with a broken heart
heres me praying for the bts and just betting jes bumped his head at least once

my jaw dropped with his entry
the eyeroll bitch  this is so real great was not looking to get fuxxord on this night and has to get ready help


thyme so sassy why u rolling your eyes when your bottom needs to prep
i cant breathe

i cant get over this moment wasnt tyme lowkey hating great i get the angry focking with purpose but this was anything but and no one can convince me of the opposite like did he have to hold his face oh so gently and go into that kiss so passionately as if greats mouth holds all the answers to all of his questions worldshattering sigh

i think it all just comes down to tyme likes pretty things and regardless of how he feels underneath it all or his ulterior motives he can appreciate that great is so pretty and in a different lifetime tyme would be so down 

me tyme might be conflicted and not 100 sure about his feelings cause he might start seeing something in great
imomen he just likes pretty things lets be honest
me yeah im def delulu
someone turn on the lights gotdamn 


isnt that your job 

i first didnt see who commented and was like just wait imomen is going to do it and then saw your comment and was like oh its imomen



this made me cackle  we are all imomen stans here 


this is the rich bitch great i was expecting negl i could hear him thinking watch it fucker 


what i loved was this episode makes the tymegreat nc scene in ep 4 make more sense and is even sweeter now great clearly fell hard for tyme and in his little purgatory existence he imagined that precious awkward tent moment as their first time instead of what really happened drunk after a bar more feral sex great is actually a puppy at heart but we also get to see the real him in ep 6 i love sammon this is so true to how complex humans actually are and how we view ourselves vs reality
i didnt love kinnporsche sorry folks so i wasnt into bible but i love him with jes i can feel sammon all over this too it reminds me so much of manner of death which is a fave of mine jes reminds me of tul
anywho excuse me while i go rewatch minutes 1523 again even taking out the nc scenes im really enjoying this show


i like this version of great way better than the first half lol this one is bolder confident aura

this version of great is a terrible person and desperately unhappy though ill take the first lol
yas bad bitch great era is everything 
omg

lmao
werq bitch brothers avenging their brothers deaths seems to be a big theme for a lot of sammons writing for boc and honestly im here for it
when the music started i was screaming 
this is so cute  they found love in a hopeless place 


god i loved this moment
bible is at his best here
and another huh reaction was born lol



i felt kinda sad at the end of this episode i kinda liked nice great who isnt real then it also pretty much confirms that none of the characters are going to get a happy ending
edit and tyme and greats relationship i liked the fake time line much better 


omg just great episode i love this side of great but can we all agree that hes clearly depressed and only acts like that because he wants attention   remember the scene when he was talking about how unhappy he is and the meds he takes and whatever happens in real life or his reminiscence during his heart attack great got shot anyway xd
such a great episode  now were finally arriving in the present to see what is happening for the first scene of episode 1
like the few last time i tried to create a diagram with the main event i hope it will help someone
helpppppp
cute greats already in protect me mode w tyme lol
i loved this messed up version of great when he drove away from a hit and run we knew he wasnt a good guy but i still didnt expect this side of him im sad the nc scene wasnt continuous gotta get that durex ad in and by lack of fuaiz again i did think it was great reliving memories but changing things im just wondering if tyme is also is this limbo place with great so their cute dates did happen but not in the real world or is it all in greats imagination theres a scene when tyme gives great a coffee cup but the message changes on it to im sorry great so my thoughts are that they are both in this limbo place
i guess next week we will see what happened to tyme would tonkla have a reason to hunt him down is win protecting tonkla do we think things still have to go down between korn and tonkla too its torture waiting another week 


i think win gave kla a heads up i think he is protecting him

i think so too that boy is in love also he didnt look very shocked when they couldnt find tonkla he was like oh noooo 

well well well i am at the point that i have just decided to trust that i will i understand it by the end and im officially going to stop trying to work it out
great episode great nc cutie pie moments that were a good contrast and a compelling mystery i think it is the best show on air at the moment certainly one of the best of this genre


does anyone else panic about the cats fate if great dies
genuine question here  are the nc scenes actually worth watching in terms of adding to characterization andor plot i dont particularly find nc scenes all that interesting if there are no feelings involved so i skipped them as soon as i realized tymes motivations
im really curious to see the fandoms reaction to tymes action with the video because the reaction in dff was intense to say the least greats reaction also made me so sad because it shows how little he values himself the sexual promiscuity the drinking basically going along with whatever happens around him  this is a boy who doesnt really care what happens to him
ngl after both dff and now 4 minutes i am kind of glad that boc is going to do a sitcom because they appear to have developed an allergy to having any real romance or love in their bl i have an appreciation for real life themes but i also dont mind some actual romance and love yknow the prior episodes were sweet but knowing it was all fake kind of ruins it and strips their meaning away
realizing that tyme most likely hates great was a stark contrast in comparison to greats fantasy of the last few episodes not only has he been making himself a better person hes been imagining a world where tyme was actually interested in him and liked him which kind of makes it extra tragic
at this point i am mostly interested to see what happens from here there must be flashbacks from tyme i am guessing so i am curious to see what he will change perhaps he regrets the video i hope so as remorse should really be depicted with that heavy of a topic
i will say though  i do like that they made tyme absolutely terrible as well like he goes after great for the sole reason of creating revenge porn and then turns his back on safety for his grandmother for the sake of his quest for revenge  but judges great for his very human response to danger greats no innocent himself but tymes got himself on a white horse he deserves to be knocked down off of
now to see how this all wraps up in the next two episodes at this point i am kind of assuming that tonkla korn great and tyme all die but im side eyeing boc for their promo picture for the final episode lol


im going to play devils advocate and say that great isnt inherently evil troubled yes its a direct result of his family dynamics he goes along with whats hes told to do because hes to afraid to rock the boat when he meets tyme hes finally able to start taking a stand
so as expected w sammons writing everything is explained in a real world way seems like no timelines no powers etc just great and tyme experiencing near death and in his mind wanting to go back and make things right etc
sammon  ppond cackling rn lol

thats insane but also bible wichapas sumettikul the actor you are 


i knew it bible as a baddie is so much hotter though  i like it



oh god i loved this episode the best one
great what a brat bastard coward you are
this time his claims to his father about killing people are very hypocritical considering he killed that woman helped to kill dome and did nothing to help nan
the poor man felt so bad about disappointing tyme that he dreamt about fixing his mistakes and being a good person but too late
probably a lot of people will be swearing at tonkla but he did what he had to do title and great got rid of his brother like trash so they deserved the same fate
its just the 6th episode so i wonder how things will continue now will the series take into account the timeline great created in his mind or it will be just forgotten


the poor man felt so bad about disappointing tyme that he dreamt about fixing his mistakes and being a good person but too late probably a lot of people will be swearing at tonkla but he did what he had to do title and great got rid of his brother like trash so they deserved the same fate
full agree 
i am team tonkla kill em all kla i support you 
but also bratty great was hot af  and in another parallel universe i really really really really want the tyme that grabbed great by the hand and dragged him away from the aunties that were making the food when great got pickybratty and disciplining him


this show has an interesting concept but unfortunately the romance between great and tyme is the weakest part imo this is an issue that i have with sammon shows overall she doesnt write compelling romances the thrillermystery and some characters are the strongest aspect of her stories 


correct sammons work never makes the romance the plot it isnt central its just kinda thrown in there with some hotness but desire and want and passion stemming from actual romance is never central or important in her stories so we knew going in that it is unlikely that we would get happy romantic vibes

just because romance isnt the plot doesnt mean you cant still incorporate a compelling romance its interesting that boc did kinnporsche which did have a more compelling central romance but the mafia concept was underwritten imo they are doing interesting productions but need to find a balance 



secret crush on you
here is my contribution im ashamed that i havent read through the epicly long thread but here is my super long contribution
ok think i have two different theories about what is going on im not sure which im leaning toward more and i know i missing something but here we go anything is italic is my guesses
three timeline theory
for this one there are three different timelines og great and thyme great and thyme both get a chance to fix their past and then their combined efforts will be able to give everyone a hea
original timeline
this is the timeline that kla korn and wins story is taking place in it is the opening for each episode including the first one
title kills dome and great helps reluctantly greats help is caught on the dashboard cam of titles car
win gets pulled into kla and the injustice of his brothers death is being kicked under the carpet he agrees to move in with kla for protection while kla kicks korn to the curb for being a shitty boyfriend
kla drugs title puts him in titles car just like dome and kills him he also watches the cars dash cam and finds out about great
win finds out about kla and tips him off he is about to be arrested  win might have found out before moving in but i dont think he could have hidden the evidence for that long
kla flees and goes and shoots great
kla or win kills korn more on this down below
we get to see the rundown of this in episode 6 but here are a few things that will be important later on in both theories
in this timeline thyme and great arent that close thyme is using great and although there are moments with tyme where there is something more he hesitates to upload the video it takes looking at his moms picture to push him into do that he also didnt try to use great again but pushed him firmly away there is something there perhaps in another life type of thing but no way can anything happen in this time line despite this they part on very bad terms i do believe thyme was also transferring a great deal of his own guilt at nans death to great and greats words were said because he was mad at thymes accusations that he knew were true neither one of them wanted to face the part they played in her death
in this timeline nan dies she has already passed a flashdrive to thyme but she was captured trying to steal info about the investors in the casino they were on her phone uploaded somewhere but thyme doesnt have them if he had access to her cloud there would be no reason to sneak out to give him flashdrives he only has what she has already given him so it wont be a complete list of all the people involved in the casino there will be some still able to help greats dad cover things up like the general that is holding the cops off so they can clear the warehouse
we dont get to see what happens to thyme after they part but all the opening episodes have been in the og timeline so the first one where thyme is shot would be included
the rest is my guesses on what happens after they part thyme goes back to the warehouse maybe it is to retrieve nans body maybe korn wanting to get rid of thyme for screwing with his brother and trying to expose his family tricks thyme into a meeting at the warehouse
korn stabs thyme hoping to kill him but is interrupted by kla kla is ready to kill korn great killed his brother korn has been a spectacularly shitty boyfriend and murder seems to be rather fun right now thyme escapes wounded
it also could be klas part doesnt go down in the warehouse but korn finds out about klas murder spree and confronts him win shots korn to protect kla either way i suspect win will be a party to this killing if that happens it could be a random goon stabbing thyme
this is were we meet up with episode 1 the guy that shoots thyme isnt going to be one of korns men he is a hitman that is hired at the temple to kill great in greats timeline in the og timeline i suspect he has been hired by nans pregnant friend to kill tyme for getting nan involved in his revenge and getting her killed
tymegreats schoolmarm first time found in a ditch 


dancerinvisible



earthmix 
and now that im a little bit less confused does this mean that it doesnt really matter the timeline great is going to end up shot and probably dead
but it seems like all the tonkornwin stuff is realtime happenings 
omgggg

tyme said scar be prepared i am choking 


i love how much of a brat great is the look of disbelief he had when tyme said we cannot see each other again he was genuinely confused to be rejected the way he was looking all over like thinking can u believe this guy he said no to me and my bubbly asscomment image immediately he called his brother the one person he knew will never reject him he and ming in msi are typical rich brats they might not outright go to hurt a person but they wont help anyone also like how great tried to stop title from killing dome but did not give much care about it altogether they are made more trouble due to their ever supporting elder brothers the kind of brothers who will only ask are u hurt if the younger call them to say they killed someone then they meet someone who will say no to them for the first time in their whole life now they are done and cant leave the other person ever how great wants to change for tyme and wished their first meeting to be romanticcomment image im sure if ming had his 4 minutes he wud wish for the same with joe all in all loving all our cute brats


omg is great actually an ahole like evil evil somehow i liveeee


i guess its true birds of a feather and all that
i found it odd he was friends with a red flag like title that should have been a clue seems like the whole family might be rotten  to the core that has not been established yet
seeing korn wiping his bloody hands today made it clear he is more hands on and doesnt leave everything to his henchmen like i originally thought 

i knew it his instinct is not great and only his revised memories are good ugh


finally bible  thank you episode 6 for your service

whyyyyyyyy did they cut the nc like that it should have progressed without interruption  it would have been epic 


because they are tired of being accused of making corn 
i agree with you i wanted more 


actually why in the world is great so into tyme they hooked up one time where tyme secretly filmed a sex tape to fuck up greats family and great was just lets do that again but this episode got me seriously stressed honestly they need to make these like kdramas and have 70 minute episodes because 45 to 50 minutes are definitely not enough also im seriously missing wintonkla we havent seen them interact properly in like 2 episodes

yeah it actually made me so sad for great that he seemingly has such little selfrespect or selfcare that he just doesnt care and even goes after tyme again he is so messed up



wow  greattyme im shocked fourhublmao for 4 mins  lol nd only fans lmao
but this show is genius timetravel4 mins future thingy is done right they gave us a whole ep about whatll happen without 4 min abilityit was interesting 
and i predicted it was tonkla from his shaky handsmaybe he knew about great being an accomplice nd how he helped title with body disposal of dome so he took revenge and killed both title and greatmaybe he got the car dashcam footage and now hes wanted by the police
i love this show its genius i really liked jesbible in this ep it was natural great was not too kind he was coward and tyme lmao posting video on 4hub and also great is freaky like who in the right mind will follow tyme after thathe really is shameless haan wow i thought he set that secret camera to find out greats dirt hit nd run nd title case but he just did that all for nothing i also thought great will get revenge but bro got so hooked after their hookup and became cute puppy after that and the durex ad nd packet lube lmao also sleepy cat tortured to eat that sponsored cat food poor babie
i love this show i still dont know whats real nd fake at this point but i have no clue how the next eps will be this bl has my fav genre and im enjoying all this suspensethrillermystery 
i also liked tymegreat scenesnoodlescared of dogshandholding felt domesticnatural and fluffy i liked this scenes in this ep more than the arcadeboba tea one 
they both look so good here 

heres what would have made greattyme be a real romance with heat which is what i wanted but sammon and pond dont want us to have
tyme knocks into great in the hospital before knowing his name and is absolutely stunned by how hot he is the most realistic thing that could have occurred its absurd it doesnt have you seen bible in that shirt
tyme later goes to the bar because his research shows that the rich gay son goes there he sees great again and cant help but talk to him immediately attracted they banter and only then does tyme find out that great is actually the son hes been researching hes shocked
great makes a move and they wind up at greats we see tyme torn because this was supposed to be about revenge but its become something else because hes super into great
hes torn but decides to discreetly set up his phone before things get serious
they have sex and its clear its about mutual magnetic attraction and theres more emotion to it than either of them expect because theyre both wounded lonely souls looking for connection but so afraid of it
at no point does anyone have to go to the bathroom
tyme is torn afterwards but decides to go through with blackmail
great finds him and they have that date as shown and its clear theyre both into each other but tyme is torn
tyme tells great they cant see each other but hes obviously upset
the rest can basically happen as we saw
but thats not what happened
because there is no romance or fated love story subplot
its just about wounded morally gray characters who are going to die
because they dont want us to be happy
i added him he hasnt written back to me yet 
he dead 


the peachesare back againhoorayso we have involuntary manslaughteraccessory to murderthis is the real greathe may have hated what his family does but he is just the same and he cant escape thisthere was also no romantic dr tymehe was on his revenge mission did his research and targeted greatso was tonklahe saw that dashcam video and went after greatat least greats mother is alivebut how much of these are visions of wishful thinking
edit is inspector stache win harbouring tonklaseems like mr tonkla anuwat has flown the coop and is possibly in hidingthe description for this ep says this is the reality realmgreats dad mentions three realms1 greats realm2reality realmwhose is the 3rd pov realm

cherry magic 
i dont have words this ep was just a gigantic slap in the face i finished the ep drained of any constructed opinion and feeling just a big waaaaaaoooooooooohhhhhhhh  its so freaking good omg  it will definitly go down in history of bl and well talk about it for a long time

im already 5 mins in and i knew they were going to do this and im glad cause i really wanted to know what happened in the other timeline



oh im a little gagged i think this might be my favorite episode overall so far will have to rewatch all episodes to be sure but the plot twist the flow and finally that scene
everyone is morally gray and i love that great being the spoiled little rich bitch that he is but with a little bit of a conscience just a little bit lol tyme baby that was nasty work but he was kind of sweet afterwards  and then theres sweet doe eyed baby boy turned serial shooter tonkla and im not mad at it
though i will admit im a little salty were not getting the spice level we deserve with these tymegreat nc scenes like the first one i can understand but i was expecting like level 11 today and i got maybe a 7 i mean i still enjoyed it i just needed more 


though i will admit im a little salty were not getting the spice level we deserve with these tymegreat nc scenes like the first one i can understand but i was expecting like level 11 today and i got maybe a 7
i am so here  i think the expectations were set and not met and unmet expectations are the worst to overcome i wish i had no expectations cause then i wouldnt be disappointed and would have probably enjoyed it much more 
when i first saw the snippets of their them doing that shown in the previous episodes through greats time memory i thought itll be a beautiful moment of them with such passionate intent they have for one another with the way they painted itbut nahh it ended up way messy of an outcome than what ive expected like tyme out here exposing great theyre both acting like strangers and their onenight stand situation this episode is truly mindblowing and it conveys a different perspective with how it would have gone if great didnt alter his actions again i am loving this sm i love time traveling and their decisionbased format its so fascinating to see each varying aftermaths 

enlighten me guys what is happening

this episode is all about what really happened in real time while the previous episodes were mostly scenes of great imagining the things he could do right before dying basically he is shot in both the reality and imagination 


there is a slew of gifs to peruse come on in

tonklaaa what are you doing here babes 



honestly
wow


holy shiiii the ass bite thats it im dead and buried 
okay but i kinda like this dynamic better than previous episodes i might be broken
still not really sure whats happening though lol ill read everyones comments and get clued up on the theories



i dont interact much here but i follow the show i wanted to ask if someone else noticed this or could explain in ep 3 tyme visits great in his university he gives him a drink with a note asking him to check his head injury but it changes for a second to tyme asking great to forgive him but this scene did not appear in the original timeline they showed today will it be explained in upcoming episodes

i think that was probably greats mind wishing that tyme would regret what he did or possibly tymes flashbacks bleeding in as maybe he will regret the revenge porn

this also bugged me and ive read multiple theories but none really feel like they fit im hoping something in an upcoming ep makes it make sense otherwise the wishful thinking theory is the predominant one but i think if thats the case its unnecessarily confusing





so your basically saying that tyme does survive his wound and head injury the one where he almost had brain damage so tyme gives him a drink at his school that says forgive me
i can do it with a broken heart
hm i woke up and i had this this thought could the two different storylines we saw be either testimonies great and tyme give to the police or both storylines were the idealised versions greats and tymes brains are conjuring up and we are yet to see what really happened  we already know what we are being shown isnt a linear timeline and we also know theres different povs and both arewere probably dead or dying at some point in the story
ugh im slightly confused and im loving it 


late to the party because i have a big girl job help i work 7 days a week i am so tired when jungkook said 7 days a week i did not think he meant this
this show is wild
so greats actually a terrible person and everything weve seen so far is him trying to recreate his memories whilst he dies careful great your vegas is showing
i ordered them to delete all the cctv footage chills honestly kinda sad great is a piece of shit i liked soft bible you hit and killed someone with your car exactly have some remorse vegasi mean great tbh if i hit and killed someone with my car send me to jail like damn their whole family is immoral great thank your dad for covering up the murder you just did greats 4 minute brain deprived of oxygen making his victim suicidal to cope with the fact that he killed her is insane great and korn probably have a shit relationship too which is why he imagined it was better and that korn a bad guy
i keep forgetting about title but what a fucking psychopath get some new friends great you cant just likekill people poor dome dome was stressed jumped in the water and killed himself oh yeah and he also smashed his own face in with a rock title you dumbass i kinda feel like great maybe has some morality but hes a product of terrible circumstances and has bad people around him and a shit father and complacent mother bible  having characters with shit fathers lol hope his irl dad is nice 
the cat  chonky bby
so tike is normal now because this is the real world and what actually happened on a side note speaking of time and clocks i went to check my laundry earlier and the washing machine had 4 minutes left
great and his low cut v your vegas is showing
does thyme know whats going on with the whole reality 4 minutes thing i wouldnt be surprised sammon has pulled this move before triage when tol started living the time loop after tin died

fourhub 
sup dad fucking lol 
always the parents pissed off their sons are gay
nah i miss soft kinda shy great take me back to their kiss in the car after they won the plushies
thymes parents started the gambling business hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
ah so korns still a piece of shit
i love all the subtle differences between the scenesx
rip nan
yeah we knew tonkla wasnt a good person when he whipped out his meth pipe and cheated on his boyfriend with the cop assigned to investigate his brothers murder
2 mire eps left 8 episodes simply is not long enough


okay i know everyone is aboard the great is evil train but i have to say even in this versiontimeline whatever i think he is a weak man and grey but not evil like hes not evil for killing the lady with his car she straight up is trying to get killed and jumps into the road in a tunnel pedestrians shouldnt be in is he weak or cowardly for fleeing the scene for sure but theres no malice involved here and then when he doesnt rescue nan in time same deal he hesitated due to fear and she got shot the biggest sin for me is when he helps dispose of the body you can be shocked at witnessing murder but you need to then say yeah screw you im out of here at the minimum i just feel its important to distinguish the world where he wants to be the hero that his inner desires are to go against the values hes been raised with his entire life so its not evil great timeline for me is realistic great timeline and in both of them hes a sad puppy that desperately wants any crumbs of affection that time will give him


i dont think we think great is evil just a coward

gotta love a fierce kvnt baddie


bocs cinematography
i wish i was rich enough to own a marble table with a built in lazy susan specifically for trying to buy off my enemies


i can do it with a broken heart
i cant wait for later tonight to watch this from the looks of it tyme great is getting whats coming for him and great tyme is showing him whos bitch boss am i right
there i fixed it


will tonkla and win be the ones hiding out in the original timeline




just fyi  the global streaming link in the main post is linked to the wrong subreddit post there needs to be an s inbetween boy and love in the url the link goes to a banned subreddit


omg lol thank you fixed you are the best


does anyone have an opinion on gaga vs iqiyi i dont have time to analyze the subtitles from both but was wondering if someone else has looked at them


looked at a couple of scenes and it was exactly the same



ok i am taking a breath and just giving my hot takes before i got back now and rewatch
i was too anxious waiting for the nc to come so i didnt pay attention to anything truly until it happened then i was lost there for a while until i got angry and now i hate all bathrooms everywhere forever and also yay tyme could keep it hard while being inspector gadget and casually slip a condom on after 10 min of walking around fourhub vs pornhub is my favorite let us know how many of you searched for secretmp4 already 
post my anger about the nc being abruptly interrupted when it could have been the greatest nc of all time i didnt pay attention to much that happened after that
the end yes kla i am on your team you gave us epic ncs with so much context that i am jumping over to your team and you can go head and kill them all tbh
baddie great although a coward is way hotter than ep15 great by an exponentially huge percentage since ep1 we saw that greats initial instincts are not those of a great human only his revised memory in hindsight seems to understand what the right thing to do is
i knew it we are getting different pov all out of order and greats and tymes memories  added in hindsight i would have done x differently while both are on the verge of death sammon is a doctor and wont go fully into timelines and scifi she just likes to explore human decisions and medical mysteries
once i rewatch without rage and anticipation and can properly pay attention i will come back

sammon is a doctor and wont go fully into timelines and scifi
everybody says that but triage is also from her and wasnt it full of supernatural time travel and all genuine question since i havent watched it yet only bits and pieces
tonklaaa what are you doing here babes 

the way i kept thinking if the camera man just slipped a little and nobody noticed

can someone help me why didnt greats mom get shot again i dont understand if episode 6 is showing the reality of how things actually happened does that mean nice great wanted her to die in the previous episode or what im confused


nice great wanted her to die in the previous episode or what im confused
probably he realizes she is not a good person maybe


anyone in sea using iqiyi to watch 4minute what vpn you used





is the so sultry version on gaga or iqiyi bc i just saw a clip from an nc scene in epi 4 that i had not seen and i have been watching the sultry version on iqiyi does viu have its own version of the show it was a really short clip so i dont know exactly whats going on but it looks like tonk la went to wins apartment
guys i need an explanation for ep 6 cus im so lost i beeeg


the prevailing theory is that ep 6 is the original timeline  what actually happened everything weve seen that conflicts  changes what weve seen in ep 6 is great revising events due to wishful thinking  regret during the 4 minutes hes still alibe after his heart stops beating when he got shot
episode 6 tells us what really happened not the alternate reality great is creating after his heart attack


now i can die in peace

without spoilers what is the spice level for this episode on a scale from 1 to 10


very flat and boring for me i didnt love it its greartyme  it was interrupted and lacked intensity for me
others may disagree

ok so this was another parallel universe where great didnt save the woman and his relationship with tyme was mostly tymes revenge and also fuckin title killin dome i guess this is the connection to the beggining and the ending of this episode tonkla killed great thats why the police was searching tonklas house at the beggining maybe title sent part of that footage to him
they summarized 5 episodes into one to show another version lol i also felt like i was watching the battle of the bastards from game of thrones because i couldnt see a damn thing
anywho i was like this the entire episode
edit wait im seeing on twitter that some are saying thi is the og timeline and great is in a coma cause tonkla shot him pls i need answerssss


the theory is that episodes 15 greats scenes were just in his mind and it was a wishful thinking of what he would have done if he could travel to the past and fix his mistakes not killing the lady in the hit and run saving dome and nan and of course helping tyme and having a loving relationship with him
this episode 6 shows what happened in the real world and greats real personality a rich brat who didnt care about anything and was able to commit murder and of course his relationship with tyme was just sex and not love great probably regretted everything when tyme called him a coward and while he is dying he imagines the other timeline episodes 15
ok i have a question havent watched this episode yet is it explicit like yk any nc scenes


its explicit yes but not as explicit as the prior ncs


yep

not reading comments bc my internet is out again 




so what happened to greats mom that is the only death we have not revisited in original timeline

she never got shot because the lady died before being able to hire a hitman this is the crumb im holding onto to justify the multiple timelines plotline since there is a solid divergence and consequence of great fixing his mistakes which wouldnt happen if he was just imagining a world where he manages to save everyone while his brain is shutting down form the 4 minutes of no oxygen he has no way of knowing that the lady has a grudge against his family so the other timeline cant just be all in his head right 


yesss the sultry returns there been so many hot scenes but seeing jesbibles entire sexy bodies is a whole another level
so my predictions are right so far it is another timeline and the 4 minutes are visions from the previous times
but hes died twice now and there might be another twist lurking
i cant believe were almost done this series goes by way too fast 


sex scenes aside can someone please discuss the plot who do yall think shot great i think its tonkla or maybe tyme


its tonkla

shocked at who we saw in the last scene



i have to say i am surprised and really delighted that this show is so gorgeous not just the nc scenes but the whole thing is practically cinematic the lighting photography score all of it is a joy to watch   
i spent a couple of episodes wondering what the hell was going on with tonklas storyline since it didnt make sense with what we were seeing strongly implied he killed title who we later saw alive etc but what we were seeing was greats neardeath revisionist history and since he didnt know anything about tonkla it makes sense now that we never got a revised version of what was happening there i think but we still have 2 episodes left and a few questions still left from the earlier eps will there ever be an explanation for the note on the cup of iced tea what would tyme have to ask greats forgiveness for so i cant imagine greats death is going to take immediately  unless he spends them in the pink room of brain death with the other 4 minutes patient which seems like a bit of a waste  
nothing better happen to that cat is all

when i said i needed more tonal i didnt mean it that way lmao





i must say i really miss tonkla and win last episodes i hope they will have much more time in last 2 episodes i need more awesomely psycho tonkla  and i hope win is not saint either
