ill miss them so much 


vegaspete  kenta deserves 
omg i cant stop watching this gif the neck hold

boc always stunting on hoes just because they can  the neon angel wings is so good 


bocs cinematography
my brain was actually screaming during that scene not only because it looked so fucking cool and bible looked so pretty with that neon light on his face but i was like does this mean hes dead

awww i loved that great ending imo so the 4 minutes experience turned great into an actual angel  the only law abiding citizen and tyme into more of a realist  sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do type of brotha the why dont you stay cover was so good and so gaggy and it still gives me chills 



as it zoomed out it looked like the second hand on the watch and then it faded completely to black at 12 but im not reading anything into that because i finally saw the canoe shot and i want a happy ending

i took that shot to be one that was going with the theme of the show  clocks have featured heavily throughout
but also i think that the watch scene was saying quite clearly that theyre alive first of all 4 minutes would actually end when the watch hits 4 not 5 lol but also i think the watch hitting 5 was meant to send a clear message unlike say inception which ended ambiguously
but if you want outsidetheuniverse confirmation sammons tweet seems to confirm that they are alive to me


cause of death the heart killers 
for the longest time i thought they were gonna inception us they almost did but i liked the ending a lot theres still hope although not for everyone my heart ached when great was be happy with the one you love to korn
im not a fan of under water kisses but the whole sequence with the sunscreen that is product placement at its finest and it was so so beautifully shot
this is one for the bl history books loved every single episode


me too honestly this ending was beatifically perfect such a good show

me too i absolutely loved this series  every single episode kept me guessing plus they stuck the landing 1010 from me  no notes

i had a moment where i was considering pulling up airline websites so i could fly to thailand and yell at sammon i have trauma from dff okay but then it was okay hahaha

ublcompilations must be losing their mind  a guitar  an interrupted kiss screaming 


bocs cinematography
cat interruption is acceptable in my book though guitar  no cat  yes


cat interruption and product placement

the double whammy

lmaooo i also thought the same thing double whammy

i was hollering when the guitar came into frame and then choking when the kiss was interrupted


i am a sobbing mess between the montage at the beginning why dont you stay the meaning in the outcome of the show and just thinking about everything that bible has gone through
ill have more coherent thoughts later but yeah  in so many ways its hard to believe that were finally at this day at the finale bible cried talking about it and it reminds me of all the pressure and all the expectations that have been on his shoulders both from others and from himself im so proud of him and the entire cast they knocked it out of the park
edit
coming back here hours later now that i am a bit coherent to say that i really love how beautifully the two pairstriad were used to illustrate the poignancy of the concept of 4 minutes
great and tyme seemed to be hurtling towards certain doom  and in fact were  and had nothing but their own decisions to blame for it great lived a life of passivity avoiding decision making and responsibility caring for very little not even himself tyme was consumed by revenge so much so that he was willing to do just about anything to accomplish it even if it meant pulling in someone who had done him no harm setting greats other issues aside by using them for his own ends
then 4 minutes happens and each of them gets to reconsider those decisions tyme chooses a world where he isnt consumed by pain and revenge a world where he is a better doctor and kinder to his girlfriend when breaking things off he chooses a world where great comes to him and the two of them are actually blissfully sweetly happy with each other a world where he holds great safely in the circle of his arms rather than sending him off into danger and perhaps to his death
in the meantime great chooses a world where he doesnt take the passive way out  instead he chooses to take responsibility to intervene to try and do the right thing even if it means putting himself in danger he chooses a world where sex isnt meaningless and he can have a moment with tyme even if its just temporary he chooses a world where hes a hero instead of a coward
and then  against all odds  they get their second chance to be together to take responsibility to make a different choice tyme leaving the father alive rather than killing him to move forward and make the best of a future they didnt expect to have
in contrast korn win and tonkla are a mess of toxic love and obsession tonkla is failed by society but also by korn and win korn discovers that tonkla isnt the man that he thought he was in more ways than one and win realizes that maybe tonkla was using him more than he thought and in korns final moments we get a glimpse of what i think was his 4 minutes where he chooses to run away with tonkla  except unlike tyme and great there is no second chance for him the clock ticks on and he dies alongside the man he loved the beauty of tyme and greats story stands out against the contrasting darkness of korn win and tonkla and i really think its quite something how sammon used the two storylines to play off of each other and how the backdrop of the tragedy of their story makes tyme  greats second chance more poignantly sweet even though theyre going to face so much difficulty
ugh if im not careful im going to start crying again lol i really think that the entire cast knocked it out of the park here bible did an absolutely phenomenal job as did bas fuaiz and jjay but i think everyone was amazing  not just the main cast but also everyone in the secondary roles too im so grateful to jes for being at bibles side through all of this as it takes someone strong to step into this role after all of the drama and be willing to face everything that would come his way from the fandom i really hope that we get to see more of biblejes going forward as i think the two of them have developed a really strong rapport with each other
at any rate its been a wild ride and in a lot of ways its hard to believe that we got to this day but ive really enjoyed the whole experience of it even with the ups and downs from week to week

cause of death the heart killers 
not not why dont you stay in 4 minutes 

rightt just why


cause of death the heart killers 
the heartbreak 

i mean


that was so hot 


the way i screamed when this happened like weve seen the nc scenes but this was so sweet and about love not lust

i can do it with a broken heart
this just reminded me did ton kla ever get his wish and was barebacked by anyone
screamingggggg


the literal 

lmao he turned his whole body 
i am so done with win 


win might  most incompetent character of all time but he gave us great things 

hes such a mess my heart was hurting for him while i was cackling  him throughout this whole episode tbh i think he would have let them run away if kla had asked really cutely lol


i think he would have let them run away if kla had asked really cutely lol
10000000

fr if only kla show win his aegyo kla wouldve live happily with two hot mens under the palm of his hand

those three were such a mess in that scene lol and win being a bad shot on top of it all omg but the scene of them lying in the ground was like shakespearean tragedy 


but the scene of them lying in the ground was like shakespearean tragedy
i kept saying oh very romeo and juliet boys
awww i knew it 



perfect 10 liners
tymes 4 minutes was so cute and the kinnporche ost was so nostalgic
and that nod to uwmaatleast this time they spared me the visual
i like how they tied everything up neatly


that moment i immediately thought of uwma


i literally said welp they can end up together in their next life like uwma  our brains are all wired the same
century of love 
dont touch me im still mourning over tonklas death  so devastated i could barely keep my focus on the rest of the episode 


me too me too  i was wanting a happy ending for korn and tonkla but  at least they died together


and korn really did love him 

ugh and here i was being a hater of korn for ages only for him to pull this shit and make me like him at the last minute smh

he really did my heart hurts lol
century of love 
im headcanoning that their souls are tied by the red thread of fate uwma style where theyd reborn meet and fall in love again 

the therapy i am going to need thanks to the trauma from the first 30 minutes of the finale jfc


it was rough lol but the last 30 minutes more than made up for it
lmao


bocs cinematography
simping even beyond the grave

as the camera was moving towards him i was positive he wasnt looking at the pics of kla he took welp



i have to say i was expecting a much darker ending than that the entire last half hour i was completely sure they were going to pull the rug out any second
lmao i knew it


i guess well never really know but im going with the hea

oh yes for sure the watch is confirmation that everything is real i think

i can do it with a broken heart
i bet omega ponied up nicely for their timepiece to be featured so prominently and crucially 

happy ending and more product placement


and this is the end i really like how they showed one simple decision can change an entire story
in tyme fantasy he just chooses not to read his mother dairy and he got a nice life with a super cute romance with great without drama or death
as for great his life is a mess whatever choices he makes showing how immature he can be that actually helped him to realize his faults and rectify what he could after his lifethreatening experience
am i the only one who got scared to death on the boat scene to get a ending like dff  also the use of jeff satur song of kp  nice easter egg 
i have a controversial opinion about the ton and korn relationship yes korn groomed ton to his liking and we really can debate if he sincerely loves ton at some point but i think they are in a codependent relationship when hes at his bottom korn always seems to go to ton and i think back in their university days he genuinely
wanted to elope with ton at some point so even if we can debate about his last action as a way to escape his overall situation i really think deep down that he really couldnt go on without ton
we got justice for den
anyway here is my last diagram of the series i will miss making those
shambles


bocs cinematography
tee flashbacks im in hell

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
loved the nostalgia of jeffs song
im assuming julphan is a sibling


sammons explains a lot here especially that they were experiencing was not a fantasy it that it was a true alternate reality bridges by the 4 minutes effect httpsxcomsammonscenestatus1834641523067306504
welp i knew it


bocs cinematography
jjay is cursed boc save this poor kitten from having to kill fuiaz and give them a happy ending somewhere

idk why their love is so tragic in series if their next series ends in tragedy for them then i would advise all jjayfuiaz stans to either jump ship or riot because its tew much  if yinwar ended in tragedy every series i would log off officially lol
i was like whitefuaiz again died  i was so so devastated i really wanted to see korn and ton happily living together but it didnt work but still the series is a masterpiece


i was happy to see korn really did love tonkla though and i think that one side of tonklas personality also loved korn

when they kissed after they met
it was giving 

well and there it was the ending
i was actually expecting a more bloody ending with all of them dead but i definitely wasnt shocked when tonkla and korn died i was pretty much waiting for that to happen
seriously give a series where fuaiz character doesnt die at the end cuz his character also died in dead friend forever 
ps  another underwater kiss for bl history d

century of love 
not fuaiz dying twice in a row in the hands of jjay  get fuaiz a new bl partner pls so hed get a happy ending next  j
literally fuiaz is my favourite actor and he died in both series i was screaming like just let him live for gods sake


he stole the show for me haha d


bocs cinematography
all during the last third i was mentally screaming take your shirts off not for hotness but because i wanted to see if they had gunshot scars i was expecting it to be a fake out the whole time so i was very tense during the end because i was expecting them all to be dead ill have to watch the end again now that i know that they made it out
but did they whooooo is that lady running the art exhibition the held shot on her after lukwa left was really ominous right now im choosing to believe they did survive but there is a chance when the clock ticked past 4 minutes they died and the boat drone shot was them dead and in heaven
though nobody else did jesus can jjay get a break is he doomed to always kill his true love boc everyone loves jjayfuiaz  put them in a show where they can actually be happy i do love the angst though they are so damn good at it
i can see why they said it was a bittersweet end tyme and great did end up together maybe but its not like they arent going to have hurdles im not sure how many years the thai system gives for accessory after the fact for murder but where hes cooperative and can be valuable in his knowledge of the illegal casino stuff and how he helped expose that politician they are going to be separated for at least a few years he also lost everything but that life had been a shackle to him
korn fucking went through it tongkla was just digging that knife deeper and deeper bas did an incredible acting job in this episode
if you are near death please make sure that pretyme great isnt anywhere near you fucking hell man thats almost another person that you just let die you had your phone right there man that was another part where i was expecting them all to be dead and i would have been so sad that lukwa and den didnt have their happy ending
honestly id be kind of hardcore down for a fasai centric show where she goes out for revenge for the person who did this to her father and make it a gl where evil people are doing evil things and they are just bad people all around
wow you guys im so blown away this finale was perfection cant believe they wrapped up everything so neatly its a 1010 for me and the ending in the boat and the kp song was the cherry on top
and yes there is love and romance and yes were alive and not stuck in the loop  well rip tonkla but at least you got  revenge and your mans back rip korn you had a great  and you were a beautiful crier
thank you uthoughtsallday for that amazing onair experience and thank you all for letting me have the time of my life enjoying all those exciting discussions speculations and all the nasty with you 

im sold on basfuaiz can we get more of them

dafuq there was a huge lump on my chest the first 16 minutes of the episode  because of great and tyme
then i went on to hold my breath because of korn and tonkla  30 minutes in and im a mess i didnt know i was rooting this hard for korn and tonkla
and this episode affirmed to me that great was a pos before his 4 minutes
now i want to go canoodle in a canoe with my beau
i didnt know i needed why dont you stay rendition by jes
i can do it with a broken heart
well i like it when a series neatly ties all loose ends in a pretty little bow and 4 minutes did just that great and tyme are less evil and less saintly than i feared t everyone got what they deserved i am content
huge thank you to the cast and crew who delivered this is a great series and be on cloud continues to serve the industry with higher standards in the cinematography acting directing even setting the bar for bloody product placement and i hope all other studios and companies are sat down and taking notes furiously

i just hope this isnt the end of fuaiz and bas because i was totally enchanted i know fuaiz has a ship and bas has something with job
but you cant leave me without fuaiz and bas it lasted very little and i need more
edit word


i completely agree bas and fuaiz were incredible together

bocs cinematography
im wondering if there is going to be a twist with dens research like they were just case studies the whole time or something the socmed accounts made a post a while back specifically focusing on dens work and if there was a hidden meaning there
also whats going to happen with tongkla and korn is tongkla going to kill korn is korn going to kill tongkla is korn secretly glad that tongkla shot great


so many questions so little time  on oct 12 the writer and producers and actors will host a session where they are supposed to discuss all of their thoughts etc hopefully we get answers there if we dont get any today

so much said here already loved it loved it a lot
not sure if the end was real or not but it was satisfying the jeffs song the kiss underwater the soft beautiful kisses  everything just dreamlike
finally an ending that i dont feel annoyed
the only cliche though  the interrupted kiss  

i loved the ending  im happy that greattyme remember their moments during 4minutes and it was a valuable experience for both of them they got me nervous in the last few minutes thinking they are gonna make dff type of ending but luckily the watch has gone past 4 minutes  i also loved their little romantic moments during tymes 4min it was sooo cute another pool kiss
having said all that i cried my eyes out during tonkla and korns scene you could see that they truly loved each other despite everything theyve done
my applause to all the creators of this show  the writing directing acting cinematography everything was topnotch i gonna miss 4minutes a lot

can we please discuss the whole thingit was like the best thing produced and presented to us as a bl fan this kind of series is iconic and i dont think anything can match this series even though ton khla died i was devastated but still it was a masterpiece to be honest
i can do it with a broken heart
i keep reading how you guys are upset by tonkla and korn dying when all i thought was yes its sad but it makes complete sense these two would never have had a happy ending they would have broken up eventually and that was my best case scenario for both lets be honest ton kla is a very cute but very psychotic serial murderer who used both korn and win to his advantage and if he ever had any deep feelings for korn im not sure these were really all there by the end korn is a weak accessory to murder torture gambling and whatnot who dropped everything like a hot potato at the first sign of struggle and win became a corrupt policeman after all because of his desire for ton kla he would so have let this man escape we all know this


i agree this was the ending however i kinda did wish for win to let them go and kla and korn be out on the run doing it raw forever and always 

happy endingg bitchezzzzz

ill miss this brilliant series and the on air thread theories the whole time i was waiting for a dff style twist the scenes with great and tyme were very romantic they are beautiful together i dont know why but i wasnt as invested in their ending maybe because it was obvious they would end up together maybe too much guitar and not enough making out i dont know
now ton and korn are a different story was it love i think so in their own twisted way but regardless they were so good on screen together omg that kiss their tragic violent ending made sense for them even though i wanted them to be on the run forever the kinnporche nostalgia at the end was beautiful i need more psychological bls like this

earthmix 


how will they wrap it all up

well i think we can all agree win is not cut out for police work  hes pretty gullible although given tonklas hotness did he really have a choice  thats the real question i think

ive been riding for korntonkla since episode one but i think i rode a little too close to the sun i wanted them together in the end though so i guess i got what i wanted 


omg okay i havent cried in a long time but the minute jeffs song started playing the flood gates opened what a lovely ending also korn and tonkla had me on the verge  the acting from bas was superb this shot in particular from jes and bible was so beautiful all in all im happy our two main characters got a happy ending and a beautiful boat kiss  ill miss them so much


bas crying was exceptional



cause of death the heart killers 
im home and ready to watch it live 


ready too but i will probably lurk here for spoilers first so i can be prepared 


im still sobbing my korntonkla 
i hope that bible and jes work together again soon

did tonkla really have to mention the cheating


i think he did it for me i needed him to tell korn that for my own peace of mind


vegaspete  kenta deserves 
i forgot it was friday and that episodes air on fridays sigh id like my free time back



i cannot wait to read the variety of opinions on the ending and the series as a whole i imagine it will be wildly divisive and i cant wait to read the rants and raves 
i personally wound up really like 4 minutes while completely understanding why others may not and agreeing with many criticisms of it 
my favorite character korn
ugh the way i love a flawed morally dark grey sad boy who cries it may be a problem i think korn wanted to be a good guy but didnt have the courage to be i think he genuinely loved kla but was weak selfish and scared he tried to live up to his familys expectations feeling pressure as the eldest but was just bad at it he was bad at being good and bad at being bad but superb at fucking up and being alone lost and confused i think emotionally in terms of how alone he felt with no place to turn not feeling proud of his actions but not knowing what to do regretting too late how he treated the people he loved  i related most to korni wonder how dark my grey is huh worrying
my favorite tymexgreat tymes
og pre4m tyme and great werent really in love and had illtimed bathroom breaks i liked their chemistry at the noodle spot but it didnt go anywhere 
greats tyme and great were lacking in scorching hot chemistry and were too awkward for me i didnt like the virginal awkward bro vibe  
post 4minutes tyme and great were actually pretty good still had a bit of bro energy but i felt their connectedness not bad
tymes version though  just right for me maybe because it was just a montage and they didnt ruin it by like talking but they had a flirty romantic loved up vibe that was neither without heart nor with too much awkward energy the spooning was divine they seemed at ease and i believed them as a romantic pair plus the montage left me wanting more so that made me feel like maybe in the right circumstances which will never happen in any universe of multiverses jes and bible could have been a great couple the dream is kept alive for me 
my favorite actor bas
i felt like bas had fantastic microexpressions that made me understand his inner conflict and his love for kla however they must have been waaaaay too micro because so many folks didnt pick up on them and see him as a jerk to the end so maybe bas wasnt all that great if were not all seeing the same thing or maybe thats just the nature of the kind of character korn was but for me bas played a difficult character really well and his final scene made me cry i was heartbroken for him which you know maybe this is  more about my terrible taste in men than anything else 
my favorite scene tyme stitching great great ver
at the end of the day this scene  while basically a complete scam and a total lie as we did not see this chemistry develop later in greats ver  was the most enjoyable moment it made me giggle it brought my expectations up it made me feel chemistry and flirtatiousness it was well done it was total bait and i resent it in many ways but as a standalone scene it was a feelgood scene that made me feel butterflies
my second favorite scene was kla and korns last scene  from klas admission to wins patheticness to korns breakdown i felt that while cliche it was shakespearean tragic in a good way and i really liked it i know others hated it beyond belief and i do not disagree  cliche tired lame on many levels for me i dont mind a cliche and i thought it was a good use of a cliche tragic ending
my least favorite moment tyme and great nc scene  og ver
this was a scene i was really looking forward to i thought we were going to see two people truly attracted to each other connected in an unexplained way longing for closeness overwhelmed by passion we got none of that and i remain pissed i will never get over how we were baited here this was about selling us a lie in teasers and i think jes had some contract about showing off only good sides of himself and it was absolutely disingenuous and i cannot release my rage over it 
my second least favorite moment was tyme and greats nc scene in greats ver i am just not a fan of awkward embarrassed virginal sex scenes 

i love your take on korn he was a really interesting character and definitely kudos to bas for portraying him so well the thing that broke my heart the most was that at his lowest point korn finally felt free to pursue what he really wanted no longer being afraid and wanting to run away with ton kla except it was much much too late
also kudos to bible for portraying what felt like three different versions of great  the one in greats head the one in reality and the one in tymes head the one in tymes head is definitely the most sweet and charming version which makes sense given that tyme is falling in love but all this to say i loved the version of them in tymes head the most too it was the first time i thought i really wish we got more of them together on this show their chemistry was impeccable there

i agree with almost all your points loved baskorn i do think on the awkward nc scene from greats 4 minutes its truly meant to be so awkward because great is a big baby and had never been in love before and actually fell for tyme so he envisioned this childish awkward moment when trying to fix it i didnt like it until their real nc scene and then seeing tymes versionit all came together for me and honestly ill take any version of jes and bible because dear god they are attractive men and dont make me feel like im watching little boys like some of these shows do idk i understand why people are mad about that ep 4 scene but for me it showed so much about great and the story

the way i squealed when tyme put his hand on greats

that last scene of them in the boat wearing black and white was so lovely

i knew korn would do that i knew it 
the moment tonkla fell to the ground dead i knew korn would take the gun and off himself
anyways that scene wasnt inside the 4 minutes but some random day where great met that woman weird
my heart stopped when they stared at the watch by the end not sure if theyre awake or not inception style ugh
anyways do we know if jes and bible will be a couple in another show or bible will keep doing bl with different ppl this was way too short and i need more bible stat 
wtf was that ending my baby tonkla

earthmix 
i have no words literally english is eluding me i loved everything about it the story the characters the actors the direction the cinematography i have zero complaints discovering jes for me was just a bonus im feeling bereft now that it has ended i was not fucking prepared for bas blowing my fucking mind with his devastation fuaiz deserves all of the awards im emotional im all over the place




its a happy ending for those who came for greattyme
for those who stayed for kornkla we are in mourning and beyond devastated 

one more nc scene with tonkla and korn before they got caught by the popo wouldve been cherry on top

the sunsetsunrise shot ugh so good yes i cant stop rewatching tymes 4minutes its so heartwarming 


i think every rewatch will uncover more missed details so let us know
this shot was beautiful and those paintings have to mean something related to the characters


cherry magic 
i will only watch it tomorrow  i cant wait


happy cake day


 who thinks they got out of the 4 minute zone
and the lady in charge of the 4 minute exhibition who is she
if great and tyme did survive what a tragic end to tonkla and korn
ugh so we have an open ended ending like dead best friend forever 
boc does it again and i lovehate them for it


bocs cinematography
i had forgotten about the art exhibition woman and id thought they did get out but maybe the clock ticking past the four minutes means they truly are dead and in heaven where they can finally be happy i dont know right now thats what im choosing to believe


thanks for the spoilers seems as its safer than i thought to go in


i added the warnings  up top

even when this whole thing ended i was waiting for ton and korn to pop out from somewhere

well that happened a lot im still confused about and some things i totally predicted
i wish we had 10 eps bc i feel like we needed to see more
i want a 10 minutes love scene with the real and happy in love greattyme i feel slightly disappointed we didnt get any sultriness in this ep we were promised sultry but all we got was tonkla and win and korns ass where is the greattyme pls


where is the greattyme pls
this was missing from the entire series they forgot to add it in 


 asking the real questions


i liked the ending whether it was real or not at least one couple is probably happy somewhere maybe both  one in the real world and one in the afterlife much better than the bloodbath i was expecting

now i can rewatch this masterpiece and enjoy the entire story again the ending was beautiful and tailored for this type of plot also jjay klling fuaiz again  i chocked at that scene doing me a bambooze near the end too on the boat i thought it was gonna end like dff  but im very satisfied with the ending 

tyme redoing his meeting with great was just so sweet and heart breaking it was apparent how much he wanted a healthy rs and treasure great if things went differently 


i am not okay the happiness montageending to why dont you stay from kinnporsche omg  that song makes me want to cry on a good day but paired with this finale damn  i was expecting a really sad ending so pleasantly surprised with what we got never getting over ton kla and korn i was unexpectedly wrecked there
that was really excellent stuff though it was unpredictable and had me throughly gripped

the happiest ive been with a bl ending what a tragedy for clyde and clyde  ton  korn lol


omg someone put born to die as a fan made mv for korn and tonkla and i cried omg yall



i was confused until the end but from what i got this was a story about near death experiences and that there were no actual powers the real power was both of them inventing having a romance in their own 4 minutes  though i cant say im completely satisfied with this ending maybe it needed a few more eps to completely tie everything up
overall it was a great series jesbible had insane chemistry i hope they do a repeat project together but the star of the show was definitely sammons writing this is already her 4th live action bl and she still out here doing queen stuff i am now massively hyped for the upcoming spare me your mercy


very good storyline the way they wrapped this up in 8 eps is still shocking to me and am i the only one bawling my eyes out for kla he deserves better  the whole world failed him


the whole world failed him


damn you said it perfectly

ok my question from last week still stands in ep 3 tyme tells den about his friend seeing 4 minutes into the future in ep 4 den tells his female patient about it so either
greats dying brain conjured a perfect image of a person that he never met den
those scenes were shown out of order in which case the riddle was presented in a way that makes it impossible to solve
tsk tsk im not even going to dive into tonkla seeing his brothers ghost in that one scene
is this series worth watching in the end i think it is but ill say something opposite to what i usually feel after finishing a bl  i wish the writers were less ambitious with their script i would rather take more conventional explanation that makes complete sense rather than super convoluted one that explains everything in 95



its just one writer sammon and shes given some explanation which you can read here which thoughts also links above but you will find that its not a conventional explanation given sammons explanation  that the 4 minutes universe is a kind of special dimension  she makes allowances for impossibilities if youre not aware sammon is a medical doctor and her scripts often go deep into medical science however in both 4m and a past series triage she inserts some supernatural or beyond known reality elements that play with fate time and regret

cherry magic 
just a quick question if great was actually shot by tonkla why is it that we saw another image of great dying with his mother and not in the elevator  i find it strange to show a bit of his 4minutes at this moment of ep 1648 
also great went to the police about domes murder but do you think he told about the hit and run too  or was that already delt with i dont remember
and we were sooo fooled about the actual exhibition  nice job 
overall this show calls for a binge rewatching i will definitly need to schedule that somehow

its because its thanks to tyme that great regain consciousness at this moment they are both having heart attack and experiencing their 4minutes at the same time thats why we see great shot with his mom tyme saves great by calling his name


i think the reason we saw the image of great dying with his mother was that that was the last thing that happened in greats fake world episode 5 ends with him and his mother dying similarly tymes fake world is ending at that moment so thats why the shot of great and his mom bleeding out at the same time tyme is banging on the door i think 

i had the same thought about greats dying scene thought that was a bit strange and potentially confusing if one doesnt remember everything clearly x maybe even the editors got mixed up with the two timelines and put in the wrong death scene haha


yeah ive been wondering why they didnt address the hitandrun either really thought that great went to the police station to confess about that and not just about witnessing domes death


that was so good i definitely wasnt expecting a hea

i quit watching during episode 6 and decided to wait for it to end because i wasnt really enjoying it the only characters i was rooting for at that point were win den tonkla and nurse bee
i really loved triage the end was frustrating but not enough to ruin it i loved dff until the end which completely soured me on the entire show i should have stopped that one on a high note 
what do


if you want ask me questions and i can answer unless you want me to spoil it i will say the end scene made a lot of people panic that it was similar to the end scene in dff but thankfully it was not
ask me any questions or tell me how much you want me to tell you

still so confused with plot nd i cried the entire episode 3



i will follow bas to the grave to the grave i say


me too lets go together

i was watching this after coming back from the club with a terrible hangover and oh my god i cried buckets and suddenly sobered up i am gonna do a rewatch after i calm myself down how do you guys even lived through this this is pure agony comment image


i think many cried as much as bas did 


all i have to say is that bas is a very incredible and fine actor hope to see him as the lead in another show totally stole the show for me along with fuaiz both are the standout performances for me in this series




spoilers
ok the whole scene starting where tonkla tells korn he shot great and then ending with korn shooting himself wow so well done the way they faded out the sound and everything the acting from bas one of the best scenes in the show for me personally because it was done so well


agreed

thats exactly what i thought i literally warned them that i would throw hands if they dont wrap the last episode respectfully and they got scared yall 
damn that was a ride my bacteria brain finally understood the series like there are still some stuff that i was confused about like i dont remember seeing warit killing wanchai literally dont even know who that is and am i the only one that literally doesnt know where this warit guy popped out from like maybe they explained it but i missed it but like literally out of nowhere he popped and they didnt specify if he was a family friend or a relativeetc and tell me why i gasped when i realised that girl i think her name was fah who wanted korn was his daughter she was right anyways 
my heart ached for our poor kla who literally could never properly feel loved without there being death and blood involved and it hurt even more when korn realised that there isnt a life without himlike at that moment he didnt think about his brother that he loved so much or the business or his father that he tried so hard to satisfy he just chose his lover which he should have from the beginning  i was skeptical at first like i thought he was over kla but after that scene where the girl tells him to choose between her or kla and he gets up and like takes a deep struggling breathe making a very hard expression like he wanted to just break down at the thought of doing that to kla i was like my man is on the verge of struggling
the ending jeff satur song made me remember kinnporsche that was such a suprise fr
 ugh it will take me 50 million years to get over this until i watch all the interviews and read all the reviews i shall seek justice for our tonkorn couple in my heart 
also that 4 minutes story was hella well done confusing but well done
thank you for reading

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
tell me why we didnt get to see tyme great reunion once they were conscious again after the shootings
i was also missing tyme saying sorry to great repeatedly for how harsh he had been towards him
also wtf has just happened overall

im still lost ccan someone explain lmao


lol up top i linked sammons explanation she is the screenwriterauthor

bass acting was really top notch his expressions were so good in that short scene


it was incredible i think we were all taken aback by how much that scene and his tears got to us eventhough most of us were expecting a not so happy end for them but seeing his emotions floored many of us


fujoshi
i guess we just not gonna talk about the lady great killed with his car 




will miss this crazy show i still dont know how theyll endhope they dont make it all to be like a fever dream or dead peoples 4 mins before going to afterlife etc also im prepared for the crazy ending afterall its not going to be happily everafter for either of the couples unless wintonkla pulljoker nd harley quinn


there is a monk today

im dumb can someone please explain to me how bible saying he can see 4 minutes into the future in the beginning of the show is relevant to everything im so confused 


the series is about how both great bible and tyme jes imagined redoing their recent pasts and fixing mistakes they regretted while in real life they were flatlining and their brains were running out of oxygen
when they both came back to life from flatlining  tyme because den yelled at him to wake up great because tyme reached out to him through his own mind  they realized they had a romantic connection with each other and they both became better versions of themselves
was that what you didnt understand


sammon screenwriterauthor explains the 4 minutes here


i cried through the whole thing




i got not all my predictions right only that ton kla would die and that win would be left heart broken
but than there came that scene at the lake it reminded me of dff
i was like not again a ending that seems happy but in fact all are dead
so i was glad it turned 1105 and i thought that great really had turned his life around just because of the 4 minutes experience and both are happy ever after
untill i read that they both are allso death what i predicted last week but i dont need to be right
i prefer them alive
edit i watched that scene again and i think i did not pay enough attention to what they said that means in the real world you knew this place already exist right
so tyme says that in their 4 minutes they experience things and surroundings that are familiar so great must know this lake from when he was in real time and great says no never been here i just drove randomly in my 4 minutes to here
they actually want to be in their 4 minutes and are glad that it got 1105 so they are going to stay there in a happier place but that means that they are dead
this show is making me mental first i thought they both have changed so much for the better great not a egoistic person but is caring and tyme is now a doctor who has bedside manners
and that all because of their 4 minutes experience
but now i am thinking totally different
and still not sure now second edit of this comment cause in the end tyme says i thought we had not come out yet so if i follow that this is the real life

i think something that people are missing is that the 4 minutes would end when the watch hit 4 not 5 so going to 5 definitely means that they are alive imo
plus if you read sammons tweet it kind of backs up the idea that they are alive but going strictly by canon i think they were being very clear that they are indeed alive they remember their 4 minutes and thats how they go to the lake even if we dont know howwhy great discovered the lake in the first place
the author said they are in the real life  its very insightful and made the show even better for me
httpsxcomsammonscenestatus1834641523067306504

so kinnporsche exists in 4 min universe as a tv series and jess enjoys watching bl shows
that is why he could turn into a singer in his own 4 min experience and sang the one song which is his favourite from his favourite show



im also reducing it by 5 for the exact same reason just a bit too much head scratching throughout

i was very confused by this show i enjoyed but also didnt know wtf was going on i need to watch it again all at once


i need something really fluffy and sweet that i havent seen before to recover from this


kidnap is not actually about kidnapping and it is oozing bl out if it especially ep2
ok so i havent watched it yet i will come back after i do


wishing you all the best we will provide support here when you finish


earthmix 


i think now that we have survived all the stress and trauma a rewatch with calm nerves and hindsight should provide a very good watching experience with i am sure new things to uncover

ok i still fully dont understand what the hell happened namely what were the first 5 episodes supposed to be was all that an alternate reality they slipped into while they were both dying if so where does that leave this eps short alternate version of things
someone please eli5 


i linked sammons explanation above and someone posted it here as well hope it helps 

korn was greats safe place the only one who understood him from his family and made time for him great lost his bestfriend


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
am i the only one that wanted a winkla fucked up hea  im so sad that kla died in the hands of win  im so sad that win has to live with that and the fact that kla loved korn more than he ever even liked him 
that said what a show i cant believe the team was able to tie all the loose ends in this episode im definitely rewatching this show very very soon
thanks thoughts for running the onair threads it was lovely reading all the theories and opinions about the show 
ps i really hope the gl boc is producing will be up to par with what theyve been doing i hope the fls will be as messy as all the characters theyve given us so far in dff 4 minutes and kp


thank you for all your contributions every week

i dont get this show


its definitely not for everyone i am sure there is another bl that fits you perfectly 

oh my god the way i held my breath until the end bas the actor you are i felt so bad for korn and tonkla even they deserved better in this lifetime greattyme reunited at last i was bracing myself for a sad ending tbh but they surprised me esp when they were looking at the goddamn watch in the final scene i thought i would go crazy nothing to look forward on fridays anymore bye bye 4 mins


solid solid ending we dont normally get great ending from thai bl but this one landed
i have to hand it to boc they make great shows i hope they continue with sammon



bingewatching this in one day lol im just glad that i waited for this series to finish before watching it also it is best to watch it without any spoilers it was not that complicated tbh as long as you pay attention to the dialogues and the scenes if you are still very confuse about the timeline just go to recent discussions segment on mdl someone provided detail explanations it was a good read
im proud of myself because i mostly guessed everythings right my brain is still braining thank god although ngl the ending almost giving me heart attack i thought they gonna pulled some dff on us hello trauma my old friend got me there sammon korn and tongkla ending kinda appropriate for them because i dont see how they gonna end this happily given their current situations
overall it was a very very very good series  the acting everyone slayyy the beautiful cinematography the ost why dont you stay cover by jes literally chills guys everything was chefs kiss
also they did not hold back with the sexy scenes gosh blessed my eyes i think im in love again with bible and thank you for jes whoever casted and paired him up with bible needs a raise their chemistry 


binging i think is the best way to watch this series

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
that kiss in the water was beautiful



well atleast they gave us a clear happy ending unlike dff
but one plothole from greats 4 mins timelinegreats mom killed by the lady that met with accident they just forgot her completely nd unexplainedill consider it his manipulated memory coincidence like the river scene when they were in a location from his 4 mins
tymegreat got their happy ending but great in real life is a real coward huh did not call the ambulance for dens gf when she had heart attack killed a lady by accident accomplice to domes murderatleast he got jail time for that  did not help nan so the fourhub was the reality lol atleast he did not let his parents come back
tyme did a good job disabling fahsais dad aka warit i liked his revenge mentality also his 4 mins was the cutest tymegreat romance was top notch in this ep wow so cutend natural
also they killed my fav shipcharacters 
my dear korn he just used fahsai also called upon the partners daughterthat warit fahsai killed for korn he snitched on them as revenge lol
and i didnt know korn liked tonkla that much sigh he unalived himself blamed himself for whatever tonkla did tonkla killed his dad too stop it korn u didnt make him go villain mode both tonkla nd korn got their romeojuliet end sighbas crying made me sad wow the actor that he is hes phenomenal alongside fuaiz dark confession to kornboth bas nd fuaiz got all my attention in this show wow i love their acting so talented bas really lived the character in the end 
also tonkla who did he even love in the end like im confused he stopped korn from shooting win and died getting shot by win ill presume he loved korn in the end sigh
korn even was ready to runaway nd help tonkla here i thought he came running to tonkla because fahsai rejected him he even committed suicide aaaahhh oh my korn my fav character died
also win was unemotional like wtf he shot tonkla but still standing there with his poker justice face reasoning with tonkladid he even love tonkla i guess he likes his job moresigh
it was 95 for me butt reducing 5 for that plotholenot explainingreason for greats mom shooting  so overall 910  for me
they made it into a bl by the end  atleast greattyme are happygoodbye to 4 mins it was fun i love this show cinematographyquality was top notch good job boc

have you all noticed why dont you stay in 4 minutes it was literally the flashbacks i am screaminggggg



so dr tyme got his pound of flesh and moredeath is too easy living in a vegetative state contemplating the sins done over and over would be the bitter ending for general waritafter that fasai rejection korn ratted out uncle warit consequences the torture he gotkorn so hopeless chose his ending with his one and only true loveafter getting out of his 4minutes seems great has finally used his brain thus great and dr tyme planned the justice they wantedand great for someone who coasted through a carefree life finally took responsibility for his actionscongratulations to the 4min production cast job well done esp bas and fuaiz superb acting portrayal of the tragic couple


fujoshi
my theory i think both of them are dead the scene at the infinite lake and the two of them lying in the canoe is a metaphor for passing to the afterlife along with greats comment why are we here if i didnt know this place seem like clues that they are dead but together in afterlife after tonkla and the brothers death everything happens very quickly we dont see how they recover nor the direct consequences the following scenes seem to take place in another dimension and although we know that great goes to jail the series curiously ends with that unsettling scene really the ending scene is so unsettling i want to cry because everything makes sense i wont believe they are alive unless boc deliver a special episode


can someone please explain it to me like im five  why did it matter that they had never been to the lake before why did that fact make them think they were still in the 4 minutes


when they were in the canoe they were thinking about their times in the 4 minutes alternate universe they each lived in while they were near brain death
tyme was wondering how did the place they were now in in the real world show up in greats 4 minutes alternate universe if great had never been there until this moment in the canoe essentially if you had never been to a place how could you imagine it perfectly in a dream great did not have an answer to that he did not know how he had pictured a place perfectly that he had never been to
given there was no explanation and it seemed improbable to picture a place perfectly that you had never been to it made them both suspicious they were actually not in reality its like a moment you personally may have experienced in a dream where you realize wait a minute this doesnt make senseam i dreaming so they worried they were still trapped in the alternate universe

finale had me in absolute shambles win of course went ahead and gave us nothing as a cop  but thats fine had a breakdown with characters getting eliminated left to right  but my fave part was def the karma towards the end when tyme decided to keep that man alive but telling that mf hes gonna be heavily handicapped purrrr  laughed my ass off fr but the ending i loved it one of the best series ive watched

am i the only one who feels like tonkla took the bullet for win and not korn because he thought korn was gonna shoot win      i hate myself for loving korntonkla only in ep 8  now i am scrambling ao3


hiiii is there a cover version of why dont you stay im looking for it huhu pls help


in my villain era
well sammon predictably gave them the happy endingcowardand the other was so cliche it was almost painful it was so figgin convoluted that it was borderline nonsensical im just unhappy with the whole mess of this series next sammon series i go in with 0 expectations
i loved the viusals of this i think the boc boys killed it but the writing was not capable of keeping up
kabada


im with you this show is not well made
storytelling art is making complicated storylines easy to follow
what they did here was the opposite  make a medium complicated setup a fucking messy pile of random scenes you kinda have to wade through and nobody who doesnt read secondary sources can realistically follow
as always the first couple episodes were cool and intriguing but the second half what a complete shit show
