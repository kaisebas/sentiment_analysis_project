We’re only 3 episodes in but Fuaiz has truly been the breakout star of this show so far. The range of emotions he has displayed in a span of 3 EPs has been remarkable.

I feel like BOC is setting him and JJay up as the next big couple for the company. More than TaCopper at this point.

I was dying for Fuaiz to get to flex a bit more in DFF so I’m living for this and people seeing his potential. AND I’m glad that BOC is pushing them a bit more since Copper is going to be away so they can’t do anything with TaCopper in the meantime.

Was NOT expecting Tonkla and CopJJ to hook up so quickly.

ALSO not expecting Dr Tyme to reveal himself to Great already.

The time changing is also sus. Dome woke up but we still have no info from him, and Title is still running around free.

Captain of the Li Dongyuan/Ruan Lanzhou ghost ship ⛴️
So someone had mentioned way before the show began that apparently it takes 4 minutes for a person to die when their heart stops beating. So if Great is in the midst of a heart attack and his heart stopped beating at 11:00, and 2 minutes have passed, does that mean he has 2 more minutes left to live in some timeline that affects all the others? If that’s the case, he doesn’t have much time left and he’s nowhere near getting his and our questions answered 😩

Inspector Win/Tonkla sex scene was everything!! I enjoyed it so much more than I did when Tonkla was with Korn. Maybe it’s because I like angst and sad boys but their scene was more meaningful to me. Tonkla being a sad boy and taking advantage of Win’s feelings and using sex to feel something is so real. In contrast to the sex he has with Korn, Tonkla demands to be pleased by Win instead of receiving whatever is offered to him. Also it looks like he’s the only one that cums when he has sex with Win. Totally living for him being a power bottom

Can’t wait for Great and Tyme’s scene next week!

BoC's Cinematography
Angry Fuiaz. Power Bottom Fuiaz. Nihilistic Fuiaz. We got so much range from him today. Where does BoC find these incredible actors?? (Maybe someday he'll get his wish to be fucked raw - give it time, Win actually likes you). And I LOVE that we got another super realistic sex scene. Demands for what to do, actual cum shot on his chest.

The shot where Great was leaning in to kiss Tyme with it intersplicing the future of them together, plus the music made the scene so dreamy and romantic. It was my fave scene of the episode.

"Can You Forgive Me, Great?" Okay, way to break the heart of the audience BEFORE they are even a couple. So, as we know since he got into a damn knife fight with Korn, Tyme was just trying to get closer to the family by going after Great, but as we also figured out, Tyme falls for real.

I love the small cinematography moment of the nude bra on the sink in the bathroom with Korn going to Nan putting on her own nude bra. BoC is so good at cinematography that little teensy moments like that really are paid attention to.

Speaking of cinematography - we got THAT shot. That Bible ass in white undies shot. But with the music and the rainy city scenery with the two grumpy kitties holding hands on the couch? Such a fucking GORGEOUS scene. This show is such fucking eye candy, and not just because of the people. Each angle and color choice is *chef's kiss*

I was so tense for Nan when she was looking in the safe. How does this all connect? I'm so invested. Tongkla's brother obviously got killed by someone important. Maybe the Tongkla stuff is a totally different timeline than the Great stuff? I know that there has been some intersplicing, but only from Korn's POV and he tends to wear a variation of the same outfit all the time.

I wanna go on a kitty claw date!

EDIT - The whiplash I'm getting because interspliced with this, I'm on a big King In Yellow kick, so I've been watching the first season of True Detective. I'm going through the ringer with my current obsessions

Cause of death: The Heart Killers ❤️‍🔥🔪
I'm obsessed. OBSESSED. Here's all my thoughts with more question than answers and no particupar way to tie them up. Dome is alive and I'm starting to believe Tonkla's brother is just a decoy the same way we thought White was someone else in DFF. Did Great's parents have something to do with Tyme's parents's death?? Is that why he's after them?? When we started, everything revolved around 11 o'clock then Great got stuck in 11:01 and now he's on 11:02. We seem to be progressing into 11:04, 4 minutes indeed. But what do they represent? Tyme asked that same question to Den; why 4 minutes? Doesn't Tume come across as stalkerish? He really asked some rando and Great doesn't find this unsettling?? They cute though during the date. Shouldn't last though and that ending was announced with the "Would you forgive me" note.

Now, Tongkla. I bow down to Fuaiz. Baby is showing everyone how it's done. God he's so good!!! Both NC scenes have been super realistic. This time around he went for his own pelasure and didn't care about Win's. The attentiin to detail with the come on his chest??? THAT had me gagged. GAGGED. BoC is ona whole other level and I'm loving this relationship between Sammon and BoC. It's giving quality both in plot, acting and cinematography. No one is touching them. I'm here for them. 🙌🏻

3 eps. 3 🍑🍑🍑. We are being SERVED.

I was not prepared for this.

no, not at all.

I know next week is the big NC scene, but there has been an NC scene every week.

"f*ck me raw" X2
full on naked butts
very realistic motions and noises
j*rking off
and now...semen

The only unrealistic scene was the oral s*x scene on the woman.

WOW

I'm speechless.

I cannot see ANY of White in Fuiaz in this show. We are talking (rightfully so) about the duality of Bible comparing Great to Vegas, but Fuiaz is doing such a good job.

He wants to get fucked raw so damn bad. He wants to FEEL it. Korn keeps him at arm's length all the time, so I totally get it. He is on Prep after all! lol

I'm super confused, I'm not even pretending to understand, but I'm enjoying the heck out of it anyway. The scene at the car when Great grabbed Tyme's hand I fucking felt it in my gut, it was so magical? The use of the incidental music was perfect. I'm obsessed, I'm going to die next week if we're getting GreatTyme sexy times.

My theory is that we're being tricked and somehow the timelines are messed up.
The woman who talked with Great and then talked with Win was the same.

Isn't a picture of TonKla and Dome? But Dome is alive in Great's timeline and dead in Tonkla's one.

My hot take is that there are alternative universes or Tonkla's story is not in the same timeline that Great's one.

Oh and Great's power activates when he rejects Tyme or at least that's what I think, it has happened twice now.

interesting take 👍 about the power my guess is that it activates when great take a moral decision or don't take it, like with the car accident, first he runs and then he goes back in time, after that not saying sorry to Thyme after bumping into him, and about Dome situation,... but it does not really fit with the last after rejecting tyme invitation

Love when sth unexpected out of the usual pattern happens in cinema, like you’d expect him to knock Great down and run away, but he didn’t and revealed himself instead. I was clapping for that bold move! Like what’s the aftermath of that, will he uncover his plans/secrets to Great? Did he realize that he likes him more than he should and that Great is actually innocent and needs to know the “truth” (whatever it’s about..) so he might want to involve himself and help Great? Otherwise How will he explain the whole situation with Korn and Nan, Great obv has no clue 😩

OKAY I'M BACK AND I WATCHED IT FINALLY!

Why do I get the sense Thyme knows what Great is experiencing? He either knows or is like, manipulating the 'thing'. His name is LITERALLY Thyme (Time). The Thai Milk Tea with his apology? Brooooo what?! I reckon these are flashBACKS and the 4 minutes thing is like, the ability to correct everything that went wrong before. I dunno i'm trusting Sammon because her writing always pulls through. TIME STUCK AT 11:01? That's when he died, or when someone died SURELY

'What kind of condition is this'? Probably Psychiatric Great.

'Why are the symptoms just like the patient in my research'? So it's happening to more than 1 person.

Why is Bible such a cutie pie in this? It's SO WEIRD considering i've only ever seen him as Vegas (I still haven't watched Spaceless). But I love it, I like non Psychopathic Bible.

Stuck at 21:04-21:51. Mentally I haven't left this place. How does this episode end? 😂😂 BiblexJes chemistry ON POINT. Piss off they're actually so cute.

Poor Tonkla is a meth and sex addict and clearly not doing well. Boyfriend who has a girlfriend and ignores him, brother who's just died, no family and lives alone. He may have just slept with the inspector to numb his pain but I reckon he'll end up healing something in him that Korn never could or will. Or he'll end up arresting him (because he probably murdered his brother).

Ohhhh who left the NOTE?!

Damn why does everyone in this show smoke? 😂 What does 11:02 mean? (Also how does Great have the white cat too if he gave it to Thyme)? Love his little storyboard where he's just circled 'Sex?' in red.

I REAAALLLLYY don't like Korn. Horrible vibes all round from him.

So Nan is Thyme's.... something? I am STRESSED. Why did he show himself to Great? I have more questions than answers but I know this is how Sammon works. Thyme clearly shady, probably knows Great is Korn's brother and just wants info, hence the apology on the cup (in the 'flashback'), he probably kills him or gets him killed or can't save him. I just know it's gonna be SO SO SATISFYING when all of these unconnected stories connect. Mystery BL is so where it's at, genuinely struggling with GMMTV shows at the moment so THANK GOD for 4 Minutes.

Actually so excited for next week. Can we skip a week into the future? 😂

can someone fuck tonkla raw the guy is screaming for it!!

bible cannot have that fat-ass and doctor not eating it, so im expecting some of that

i was surprised by Tyme revealing himself at the end, that was a great way to end the episode, the anticipation for the next one is hugeee!!

the only thing that takes me out from the dramatic-suspense type of vibe that the show has (which i love, it gives it a very mature format), is when there are light-comedy moments, like when tyme and the other doctor are bickering the silly sound effects is so very much Thai style but i kind of wish they werent there.. just cause they feel out of place with the overall format of the series, but thats the only thing.. the rest is amazing

Ok so, Episode 3 served all the things.

Cute date, check. If that was not the most realistic first date I have ever seen in a BL. From the cute moments, to the "I don't know what to do next" glances, and the almost kiss. Absolutely perfect.

That NC scene...um, TonKla is now my own personal code word for that specific activity. But, seriously, can we get him in rehab. Don't need to se that.

Bible and Jes just get it.

That was awesome. The acting is 10/10, the show is a vibe, the story is intriguing. I'm hooked.

No. He found his Cop that will heal all. Until the black cat 🐈‍⬛️ from ep1 kills all of us.

Nope. Pond makes sure to clear the set for the NC scenes. He is the Intimacy Director. He keeps just the camera guy whenever possible. And maybe 1 other person in the room with the actors.

He also never shoots or allows behind the scenes content for the NC scenes.

Sooo...is he doing meth? Is that supposed to be hard drugs? Or just weed? Sounds like a bong tbh.

White and Tee have come so far since DFF 🥺 JJay's acting has substanially improved.

This plot feels like a Sammon story; doctor main charicter, morally grey areas, timey-whimey, mystery/crime.

This cinmatorgrapy though...the staging, camera angles, the intetional message in the shots...my nerdy little self loved it almost as much as those NC scences.

In ep1 he was looking for drugs in a clear platic baggy. Small. So coke. Or meth. Cause weed doesn't come in those baggies 🫣 at least not enough to put in a bong. I plead the 5th. Don't ask me how I know 😉

Sooo???

Ok my conspiracy theory is.. Tyme's parents were killed by great's parents(his eyes were too serious) when they were talking about their struggles? Otherwise why would he bother with it as a doctor.. And it is somehow related to that illegal gambling branch.. Also both great and korn are unrelated i guess their single parents got remarried? And Korn's birth mother committed suicide?

So BasFuaiz is almost over huh?? 🤡.. But both are sus... Korn is a stuck up /greedy..and Tonkla is the murderer(he uses Win to get info slowly and is threatening him?) .. Also i saw 2 bras this ep i guess?? (I guess they were emphasizing the hidden meaning/korn is tied to his fiancé more)

Also that Nan girl is held captive so basically she sent it to Tyme

I might get downvoted but 🤡💀it felt like Jesbible are too serious in a way that claw machine scene(it didn't feel lighthearted for me) but advantage is it suits them both for all the other scenes... (I'm just not feeling their cutesy scenes) ..

Also i liked the editing for WinTonkla nc scene (it was a bit dark for me... But it perfectly fits the vibe) win is so in love but for Tonkla he is just a tool.. It perfectly fits the character's vibe jjfuaiz are good actors👍👍Too bad tonkla wanted it raw but both Korn/Win are too careful( about protection) 😂😂🤭

Also the reveal in the last scene wow.. The story pace is perfect.. I still don't know how they'll answer all the questions that keep on building up.. Tonkla brother mystery(who is he) ? Serial kills? 4 mins? First scene/first ep near death of tymegreat? Also Title what happened to him💀? Also what's with the grandma patient in this ep? (Den/tyme )i think it is not of much importance i guess 🧐?Tyme's ex (that the nurses were gossiping about?)..Girl?is tyme a psychopath💀 Etc we still don't have much answers hope they reveal it in the end

I have more n more questions than answers now🤡

Aww I just rewatched the claw machine scene and I thought it was pretty cute, hehe. It has that 'awkward not quite sure of each other, getting to know each other' feel. But that's the thing with stuff like this, what works for some people won't work for others and vice versa.

Also both great and korn are unrelated i guess their single parents got remarried? And Korn's birth mother committed suicide?

No, they are actually siblings. Half brothers. Their dad was married to Korn's mom when he had an affair and created Great with Great's mom. Since Great's mom was the mistress, she and Great lived in a separate house than the dad. Once Korn's mom killed herself (or in my opinion, once Great's mom figured out how to get rid of Korn's mom) the dad moved Great and his mom into the family home. This is Kdrama Family Dynamics 101. 🤣

i agree with the claw machine date. the whole series is so serious, at least in terms of filming, it gives very depressing vibe. im so worried for great the whole time that even i couldn't enjoy the date. it's definitely lacking the funny moments but ig that's the vibe that they were goin for. what else would we expect from ml who is batman at night and surgeon during daytime. i wish there a character for some comedic relief. im not liking any character rn cuz all r giving trust issues except great.

We deserve the incredible acting from this cast We deserve the impeccable writing, direction, cinematography of this series. And I've seen gay men on twitter say they love it for the accurate depiction of gay sex. We're always on our toes to see what's going to happen next. Shout out to BOC and the whole cast, what an amazing show.

Ok, I said something similar yesterday, but here I come again:

There are two different timelines:
In the original one, everything went to shit: Great ended in the hospital having a heart attack, Tyme was shot in the streets and Dome was murdered by Title.
Tonkla's story is the starting point of this timeline when Dome is killed by Title and from there, we'll see what happened to get that tragic ending where the two main leads die.

The Great of this timeline, who is about to die, sends part of his consciousness to the past, creating the new timeline, where he tries to fix things.
The moment Great does something wrong or his choices take him away from Tyme, his future self intervenes, sending him "a heart attack" and 4 minutes back in time as a way to say: "You took the wrong path, dude, fix it inmediately".

Future Great just has 4 minutes to change his past in his present timeline where he is dying, that's why the Great of the new timeline keeps seeing the time as 11:01, 11:02.
Probably when he gets at 11:04 he'll die in the hospital if things go wrong again or the new timeline will overwrite the first one and everyone will be saved.

Of course this is just a theory of mine, maybe I'm wrong.

Do you think the timelines are science fiction type of timelines or just different pov based on his unconscious mind?

I am enjoying 4 Minutes so freaking much!!! This show is so right up my alley! It fulfills both my love for BLs and crime/thriller at the same time!!! 😍😍 The story is intriguing, the cinematography is amazing, the quality fire, and Jes and Bible's chemistry is 😘. I am very impressed by Fuaiz's acting as well! This show is an absolute delight to watch. ❤️‍🔥 It's so good! 🔥

For some reason I have the feeling that Tonkla will kill Korn (what we saw in ep 2?). It would also make sense that he killed his brother himself, he didn't really seem happy that Win wants to investigate the murder, but that seems too simple. But I feel like he's guilty of something, maybe indirectly caused the death of his brother?

Maybe Great's parents killed Thyme's parents somehow and he wants revenge, and that's why he got close to Great (or, at the very least to get to Korn). Then he will apologize later with the note on the coffee for "using" Great? But, again, that feels to simple, I guess we will get even more fights from them.

I think that the suicidal woman from episode 1 and her son are related to all of the murder (or the casino?) somehow, I think we will see her son's death later (probably murdered?).

Thyme's coworker definitely got a thing for Thyme. Remember episode 1 when he got weirdly close to him? Seems like an unrequited crush.

I think that the girl, who wrote the comment, thinks that Title killed Tonkla's brother. The girl seemed to be too scared to talk about who did it and after her friend (I think it was her?) was locked up by Title and after Dome was beaten up by him, it seems like the most obvious conclusion from her point of view.

As we know, Title's father is very influential, so it would make sense that she is scared, or it could be that she meant someone who's involved with Great's family's business, as they are also influential, or obviously Tonkla.(the murderer is definitely someone influential anyway, as they probably bribed the police.)

I mean, I could be that Title is the dead brother, but from her point of view, if Title was dead, I don't think she would have written the comment (she probably would be happy that he's dead), so I say that he is not the brother.

Dome could be the brother (then Title would be the obvious murderer, from her point of view), but that would mean there are two timelines. But, as they hid the brother's face, it has to be someone we know, but we don't know many male characters yet, except Dome and Title who could be related to him. But I hope it's not Dome...

My thoughts on episode 3: Ok so the timeline of the police boy is ahead to the one we see with Tyme and Great, yes?

Dome wakes up at somewhere in the nearer future, when Great and Tyme are already fucking. So I’m guessing Tyme is screwing over Korn for revenge because Great somehow found out about his family’s real business and that’s why he despises them - and he’s probably dead by that time, which is why Tyme is out to get them.

Also, Tyme is CLEARLY lying about how he knows stuff about Great. Man this is so fucked up. All of it. It’s great. 😅

So 11:01 is when Great technically died, yeah? And Tyme CLEARLY isn’t a green flag, but using Great.

3 episodes in, I'm just losing interest on GreatTyme......something something about lack of connection (or lack of chemistry between the actors).....it's just not clicking. I'm far more invested in the KornTonklaWin scenerio and Great's family scenerio.

it's the way tyme is supposed to act! i think his main goal behind befriending great was to get revenge of some sort. he holds prejudice against riches. great is innocent and can't see his creepy stalker behaviour and takes tyme as sincere person. but we can clearly see tyme has some other plans. his feelings are not genuine at all. so ig the off chemistry was intentionally done

Did you not catch the last part? Tyme did not genuinely talk to great with the intention of dating him. He’s there to get info or something about his family, I’m pretty sure he’s the one the girl sent the message to. Hence the lack of “genuine” connection.
