yeah so great heard tymes voice and basically imagined another version of everything working out differently 

i hate it if its true 


he can die with no regrets a bold ending if thats the case  honestly i dont hate it

lmao if they die and thats the end 


yup
seriously sammon decided to kill us with baby tyme and baby great just in case the rest didnt kill you already 

nooooooo baby great feeding baby tyme why are you doing this to meeee


this was so sweet
it also explains a bit why tyme looked somewhat reluctant when they hooked up i thought it was because he had intended to release that video but its because he was going to do that to someone he was actually fond of

id like to believe that yes he was def struggling and looked very torn 

isnt baby great baby grumpy great grampa mini version in century of love

thats what i came here to ask i think it is baby great is baby san 

yes that guy is a very good kid actor like nina from love sea and the loyal pin


yes thats the girl from the sign special episode as well right the niece in love sea they are both great amazing


sammon is on my shitlist


im sitting at that temple where you can hire some people to help you out with your revenge problems as we speak 
the moment i have heard this is my son tyme i went no way

you kill mine i kill you
bad bitches only


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
the way i kept thinking about new when tonkla was going through w his revenge plot i live for both these crazy vengeful boys


that kid who was doing little great is the same who did little san daous character in century of love that boy is going places 3


he is sooo good


he is 


haha i had a omg where do i know this kid from moment before it clicked


same 


my entire game plan with 4 minutes rests on reading the posts on here about 4 minutes because i dont understand whats going on with the plot but keep on watching anyway because bible is in it


for the first 5 episodes every time you see great on screen only him this is important you are actually following his memories of events since he had a cardiac arrest after being shot the 4 minutes thing allows him to create an alternative reality and change the events that happened in real life i guess its his way of coping you have conformation of this with episode 6 which shows us the true events  reality
basically each event that happened before great goes back 4 minutes in those episodes is actually what happened as you can see in ep 6 so he left the lady in the middle of the tunnel he let his friend kill dome he left the girl die etc
now why does great get shot starting all this because domes brother tries to kill him and he gets a cardiac arrest and starts to see 4 minutes in the future just like the lady explains to the other doctor that is doing research on near death experiences
remember i mentioned that only when we see great we are following memories well what we see for the other characters during all episodes is actually the reality this is way one minute we see great saving dome and another his brother morning himon greats memoriesalternative reality he saved dome but in reality he was killed
hope that helps let me know if you have any questions


what a fantastic explanation of the show so far 


bibles hair and lack of buttons and fits overall keep me glued to this series eventhough i hate that there is zero romance

literally jumped out of my seat 


only one episode left tt
im really intrigue of what were going to get for the last episode 
as always ive made a diagram linking everything if someone has other info dont hesitate


i loveeee your spreadsheets

awwwwweeee baby great and baby tyme are so cute im dying actually 


last ep so youre still afraid of dogs 


i thought that was weird last epmakes sense now 
oh look its ton  kla 


so its as we expected 
the beginning of the eps have been showing us a scene from original og timeline reality
eps 15 showed us greats alternate timeline of events after he flatlines where we learn hes just a sappy romantic who dreams of awkward dates and awkwarder sex and pretends to be a virgin
eps 67 we see og timeline  reality in detail
end of 7 we see the beginning of tymes alternate timeline at the moment he decides whether to read his moms diary
killers
klas father killed the cat as uthoughtsallday predicted
kla kills his father
warit  korns fiances dad kfd killed tymes parents
great kills suicidal woman
title kills dome with great as an accomplice
gambling manager kills mon nans friend
gambling manager kills nan
kla kills title
kla shoots great
warit kfd kills tymes grandma
warit kfd shoots tyme or orders it
sammon killed my dreams any remaining hope for a romance and any chance for a hot greattyme nc scene
mysteries solved
the alternate tea im sorry great comes from something tyme says to great while great is in a coma state notably before he starts flatlining so not during his 4 minutes
tyme and great met as kids so tyme knew great used to be afraid of dogs
unsolved mysteries
who is lakwa and what does she have to do with great
why does greats alternate timeline contain things he could not know like things that happen when hes not there and is it just lazy writing
why am i still hoping for a satisfying ending
aww i knew tonkla didnt do it 


told ya the dad killed the cat 

so im guessing this is he beginning of tymes neardeath hindsight is 20220 journey and hes probably still gonna read the diary lol 


but this time he read it with new eyes this time he saw that his parents apologized cause they were actuallu the ones that caused this entire huge mess he has also already read doc dens research so he will figure out he is within the 4 min cycle way faster than great did



jes and fuaiz delivering the acting this ep 
were down to the wire and i still dont have an inkling how its gonna end and what the heck is even happening sammon really outdid herself with this show
and of course they knew each other as kids

everything is great but half this episode being stuff that we already saw definitely annoyed me


right there with u

whoever come up with the idea of 8 episode count your days

this show is so amazing its beautifully acted produced edited and curated its the first show i couldnt wait for the next episode since only friends and i ended up not finishing that one live it has everything my heart is in it i care so much about the characters it may not be perfect for some just leaving leeway for others opinions not that ive seen much differing ones but its been such a perfect ride for me i cant wait for the last episode regardless how i think they stick the landing next week this has been such a fun and loving ride to watch week after week


i love it so much when a series grabs us and makes us feel so much 
i support tonklas rights and wrongs


me to kla

oh
my
gawd


hope tyme will brutally kill that disgusting trash of a human uncle during his 4minutes scenario

well this was the worlds weirdest tomatoe cutting 
anyways if i didnt love tonkla before i did id love him now still do  what a pos father
why do we not see korn in the hospital with great did he run
the scene with tymes grandma tho omfg did not see that coming


the blood running down the sink i was like how much juice do these tomatoes have

i want to know how he managed to cut all those tomatoes with the cutting board on that weird ass angle and not get any on his shirt
the grandma thing did suck that was not cool

smh useless flop this is why baby t gotta do it himself


 no one does anything right except for kla his villain origin story is justified and all his choices too kla is the star of this series he is the lead and i am 100 behind him 

hes never done anything wrong ever in his life


ever




voluntarily heisted by yinwar happily murdered by firstkhao
his villain origin story is justified and all his choices too kla is the star of this series he is the lead
agreed i kept thinking they gave him such an interesting story and arc and he should have been on the poster honestly

useless flop  useful top 

im sorry but the instagram  being thegreat is iconic 

lmao loved it also highly predictable of him 

bocs cinematography
i neeeed to know whats going to happen with korn and tongkla now that kla knows that korns brother is one of the ones that killed dome

earthmix 


i just want tonkla to take his revenge i wish he would just kill title that bastard is psycho omg


he killed him 2 weeks ago your wish has been granted 


yes he did i had forgotten haha
he did kill title wait am i tripping

i saw it till the 3rd ep then i decided i would wait for it to be completed and binge i got curious and saw some comments here and the direction it is going
now i am scared to watch it

youre not alone meee tooo
atp just give fuaiz an award or smth
wait so tyme will have his own episodes of 4 minutes to change everything
omgg the child actor that played baby great is the same one that played baby san in century of love he is currently my fav child actor after watching col 


that little kid is awesome
aha clock greats tea  i thought someone was video recording them but then i also thought it was a stylistic choice thing


it was the car camara this boy found the sd card that title threw away title didnt break it the boy found it and the police didnt think the boy made a copy of it


4 minutes come for the nc stay for the story actually and the editing
i know hes not all there but i am team ton kla
types olive oil stained broken hip
wow today is gonna busy i got kidnap 4 minutes three episodes of sunspot only onemaybe i just need to get food poisoning and have to head home
please tell me we get jj x fuaiz in this episode

whatintheactualfuck
i thought i had a pretty good grasp on it i think maybe i do not so rewatch weekend it is
i am mad as hell this is over next week

wow so the final ep will cover tymes 4 minutes and well finally know if they were able to actually change anything i feel like there were a few hints in this ep that it is indeed possible so they might have although theyre both dead in this tl i still hope both are alive in another one they were able to create together 
edit im so fucking not ready for it to be over 


at the very least great fed tyme when they were little and they were adorable together for like 30 min in their childhood one time so i guess saying sammon doesnt do romance is going too far 




i feel so stupid watching this because i have no clue then i come here to get it explained to me so thank you for posting explanations folks  although how itll wrap up with one episode left i have no idea
i bloody love ton kla though everything he does just hits right fuaiz is smashing it
for such an intense show that little heart biscuit bit and the childhood scene was cute


wow this show really is incredibly well done im loving it all the thrill nd darkness
fuaiz and jj both are good actors no doubt wow i like them especially tonkla that psychotic man wow killed his abusive dad for his beloved black cat great was shot by him in the elevator and i guess title was stoned to death exactly where his brother dome was killed that explains why the officers arrived at his house
so all this 4 min thingy is just their moments of life 4 mins delulu before clinging to life just mins before death i guess
but theres a plot hole i dont understand tho previous ep how did great know that the lady he saved accident in highway was responsible for his moms death and who even is she  unknown she had a son too i hope they explain it in the last ep
jes 4 mins starts from the very beginning where he discovered his moms diary the first regretmistake that led him to leak the evidence nd the messed up situation
tonkla is twisted murderer mostly for revenge so he is like harmless a bit with psychotic hallucinations
greats parents are bad but not too bad i guessto be mega villains
also rip grandmaagain i dont know if this is also real 
rip greattymei guess they showed us what led to the first scene but im still clueless about whats happening maybe last ep will give the answers i really hope they get saved tho
i actually hope this 4 mins is actual magic power of greattymeto alter their lives like second chance to correct all the wrongs and theyll magically just rewind to the beginning to avoid their demise 
since its boc i just know theyll give this show an open ending with two alternative theories and call it a day like kpdffi think ill be puzzled by the ending and end up being even more confused lol
and poor korn too forced to clean up his familys mess on run finds his bro was shottonkla 
villain reveal too
i still have some questions and im excited for the last ep
i also liked the fluffy flashback scenes the kids were too cute nd job with his patient lover cute
overall i think ill give this show 9510 i loooovvvveeee it sammons writing is perfect cinematographydirectionacting wow chefs kiss kudos to the entire 4 min cast nd crew  from coloristthat sets the tone to intimacy coordinatordirectorwritereditor they did a great job i like how the scenes are compiled  and also the storytelling leaves viewers puzzled yet clarifies little by little im in awe wow
firstkhao sandray akkayan kantbison 
this episode made me heartbroken for all the characters and the cat  for tonkla great tymeeven korn like what could have been if the situations were differentthe kids who played young greattyme did so well i could totally picturize them as kid version of gt


they were perfectly cast as little great and tyme


baby tyme and great were so cute  how does baby greats actor look like both bible and daou omg he did so well in both series
someone made a parallel video on tiktok and when i tell you i am stuck in this moment  adult tymegreatbaby tymegreat parallel like this is it this is the show for me
not greats parents dipping first  like they were concerned for him but not that concerned lol
anyways not much from me this episode im not expecting a happy ending but i am afraid its not going to stick the landing for me  i will say it again 8 episodes feels too short

baby tyme smiling here 


gosh in this gif these boys look so much like bible and jes   perfection


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
i noticed that in most thai bls they really seem to make an effort to find child actors who you can believe grow up to look like their adult counterparts


i rolled my eyes hard when they revealed the childhood connection sammon took the lazy way out again i guess because the relationship between greattyme is still so underdeveloped so they are trying to force some connection and emotion but it doesnt work for me the most interesting thing about greattyme is   the 4 minutes concept   
 i suspect tonkla didnt kill his cat all along his actions are justified hes been totally wronged by the justice system and had to take matters into his own hands 

ton kla is verrry dexter coded especially with the cutting tomatoes and juiceblood in the sink

voluntarily heisted by yinwar happily murdered by firstkhao
i am finally all caught up and ready to join theory shenanigans
forgive me for not reading through all the last 6 episodes onairs waaaaay too many comments but believe me when i say i lived through the gifs thanks to uimomen  feeding us all 
 thoughts so far
i live for this timeywimeywibblywobbly sht thoroughly entertaining the cinematography the directing has all been on point
fuaiz is a revelation and doing all the heavy lifting when it comes to the nc except for that time win was heavy lifting tonkla
the chemistry between tyme and great in comparison which is totally unfair cause fuaiz is killing it has been a little flat for me
i know tonkla is a murderer and probably unredeemable at this point but i was so much more invested in his slow decent to madness i thought that characterisation was so well played out moreso than great fixing his regrets because we didnt really know him at that point the real great is now so much more interesting and his actions make more sense now
 theory notes  predictions
there are 2 main timelines so far shoutout to longjumpingad6775 who did a great summarytheory with events from the multiple timelines
og where tonklas brother dome is killed he hooks up with inspector win and he goes on a revenge mission murdering tle and shooting great
4 minutes where great is able to reverse domes death but also women in the tunnel  who goes on a revenge mission and hires someone who eventually shoots great i know there are offshoots from this timeline too every time he changes the future but lets keep it simple because my old brain cant process it all
weve seen flashes of a timeline where the apology thai tea had a different message so theres at least one scene that possibly belongs to a third timeline possibly this third timeline is the final one where somehow they make it all right and everyone has a happy ending right
how does the female patient who also claims to be able to see 4 minutes into the future fit into the story i think maybe we will see more of her this episode or she could just be in greats head
even though there isnt a reason for them to meet in the alternate 4 minutes timeline i hope we see tonkla and win crossing paths anyway because fate


voluntarily heisted by yinwar happily murdered by firstkhao
episode 7 thoughts
yes tonklas villain arc has come full circle and  to echo thoughts comment  he should have been the lead character though i admit it makes it more surprising that we didnt know the seemingly innocent side character was the villain of the story until later
so we do see the female patient again and tyme looks through doctor friends research hes going to learn a way to trigger the 4 minutes phenomenon possibly in himself
little great is so freaking cute the feeding of snacks to little tyme the hiding from a tiny dog adorbs i believe hes the same child actor from century of love and he was great in that too
so tyme knew who great was all along more than the fact he was his enemies son but that he knew great was afraid of dogs because they met as kids
i had a theory that the repeating 1100 motif was time of death  and this episode showed it 1104 would be the time both great and tyme wake up from temporary death im not confident 1 more episode is enough to wrap up everyones stories let alone give us a happy ending i have no idea how theyll give us a satisfying ending will people get their justice will anyone have a happy ending or will we get an openended ending and tyme and great are forever stuck in this loop where they are undoing their regrets over and over again

possibly this third timeline is the final one where somehow they make it all right and everyone has a happy ending right
im with you on the delulu train lets gooooo


win was heavy lifting tonkla 


so from what im seeing here everyone sucks nothing that happens matters and everyones gonna die unless episode 8 turns it all on its head i might be opting out

ive been holding out on watching since ch4 because im awful with cliffhangers so i need a good soul to tell me if i should catch up today or wait another week
im a bit disappointed that we got so little of tymegreat this episode especially because i started watching this show because of bible however i could even accept them dying in the end if that is necessary for a good storytelling sorry for my grammar english isnt my first language



omg that kid that found the clip might be the son of the suicide lady
i am living for villain kla so justified go kla
so he didnt kill the cat the cat was his villain origin story and like i said in ep1 the black cat  is his hallucination and the cigarettes are his alter personality 
fuaiz deserves all the praise this series when ton kla discovered that great was korns brother and then did that smirk brilliant he realised great and title were in powerful positions and going to get away with it all
im curious if great and tyme are in seperate realities or can they meet each other just like lukwa saw great in the 4 minutes room
all i hope for in the end is that ton kla living somewhere safe with lots of cats


when ton kla discovered that great was korns brother and then did that smirk brilliant
it was a great smirk however i find it odd that in 8 years he never realized who great is i mean i am sure kla stalks korns insta and that photo was on his insta and tagged  so in 8 years he never figured out who korns brother was

that was basically exactly what i thought it all was i honestly feel like this has been clear once the 4 minutes thing was explained so now we just wait to see if it goes more supernatural and tyme and great are able to live in another timeline the only thing ive been unclear about is the lady who met great and also saw 4 minutes she said today she felt shed be stuck in her 4minutes world forever if her exboyfriends voice hadnt brought her backmaybe alluding to this other timeline where tyme and great will get stuck but in a happier world but then what was that scene where she met great with that weird voice about the brain and 4 minutes them actually meeting each other implies another world or timeline to me going with that theory over just purgatory or death
and i still have to say i do not see the jjfuaiz thing at all basfuaizsmoking jjs character was a total doofus in this so maybe thats whyand he was an ahole in dff and i cant get past the pornstache

in my villain era
fuck sammonvisually love this series the cinematography is to die for everything is so intentionally done with meaning right down to the framing i love aystemetical framing and the dutch tilts in the series are so well done
but
fuck sammon and her bullshit unoriginal writing she had a chance here to do something original something different but nowe need recycled plots form triage and mod i knew i shouldnt have got so invested in the plotline but i was naive i had hope we were going to do something different i mean it didt have to be completely revolutionary but at least something with a twist anything to keep the viewer guessing to the end
finale better be unhinged but this episode aside from the beautiful visuals was a slap in the face

i just read through the post and was wondering will the finale air next week or only on the friday after september 23rd this is an existential question 


so far it is airing next week in addition to it being shown this coming monday in person plus on friday also in person and on viugagaiqiyi
idol factory usually delays the youtube release when they do an in person theatre finale but boc doesnt delay

earthmix 

someone please tell me if korn goes and apologize and makeup with tonkla


highly unlikely after what kla discovered today

yea so much for happy ending theories
so im guessing this is he beginning of tymes neardeath hindsight is 20220 journey and hes probably still gonna read the diary lol 

i can do it with a broken heart
im think well get an open ending where both tyme and great remain in a third timeline aka in a coma but i havent watched ep 7 yet


since we are nearing the end here there will be no more sad very sadso greatyme knew each other when they were youngwhat greats dad said was true dr tymes parents were the og gambling lords but was later corrupted and double crossed by uncle warit and greats dadi thought the black cat haunting and the collar was a memento of kornits a trigger for tonkla in his serial killer modefirst kill the dad pushed him down the stairs2nd kill title as revenge for killing baby bro dome3rd kill or attempted murdergreat for helping dump the bodygreatyme will see each other in their 4minutes i guess that glamping guitar hammock scene as they are both dyingmeanwhile where is tonklawill he get caughtwill win get to win tonklahow can korn forgive tonkla for shooting his beloved brother greatone episode leftwho gets to live and survivetheres a slim hope of a hea because as i remember they killed barcode in dff


remember they killed barcode in dff
exactly


like dff i see this as an open ending


yup



welli wish i was wrong but they will all die right  the trauuuumaaaaaaaa
edit i just thought of something in greats memoriesalt reality he had tyme thristing for himhahahamade me laugh in the middle of the despair i am feeling because i hate unhappy endingsits the reason i am not breaking and watching onl1y onei have a felling that one going to mess me up


he had tyme thristing for him
that scene of him checking himself in the mirror and fixing his sleeves for maximum flexingit takes on a whole new sad meaning now

on1y will likely end unhappily while they bank on getting the script for s2 funded 

is tonklas cat a reincarnation of salem cause


lol

i have so much to say but all im gonna say is what the fuck


wtf seems to be the concensus 

that drop of tears 

 but also this to me looked like a hint that he and great can actually go back and change stuff and not only in his head  staying delulu yay 

fuaiz completely stole the episode for me his acting has absolutely blown me away and his character has been consistent for the last 7 episodes he didnt just turn bad its who hes always been
i am not sure what exactly i am expecting for the ending but i just hope that everything is resolved in a satisfying manner
when lukwa said her lovers voice brought her back from her  4 minutes  and then it cut to great responding to tymes voice 


fuaiz completely stole the episode for me
he stole the entire series for me he was the lead actor 100


is the release time different on different platforms


yes as explained above
but viu and gaga are only a few minutes apart for example



definitely going to wait for the finale to come out before i watch this ep so i can binge them together  god damn from what ive read kla is the main and honestly good for him


kla is the main and honestly good for him
without a shadow of a doubt he is the main he should have been on the poster

im so glad that most of what i predicted came out to be right im finding this more easier to follow along


secret crush on you
well here is my last attempt i think at this point we have two options the first is fairly straightforward the apocalypse scenario where either one or both of them wake up after being shot but experiencing the 4 minute loops if it both more than likely great will wake up first and then go and talk to thyme so he can hear greats voice in his coma and wake up like the woman said happened to her
thyme in his 4 minute loops will put the diary back and never get involved with the casino he will either never start dating the girl or break up with he will meet great and remember the time they had together as kids and fall in love when they both wakeup life around them is unchanged and their lives are basically screwed up but hey at least they now have a bond together after witnessing the 4 minute flashback loops and are in love oo
everybody is either dead or on the run in this option so im not sure what you have left for them expect they are together
kla will go on to kill korn korn disappeared when he went rushing in he found out his brother was shot i wouldnt be surprised if kla lures him in there and takes care of the last detail in his revenge
the next one is where we get a supernatural element going on that when the two of them wake up it is an altered timeline thyme is starting out where he gets the diary it is fairly obvious that the first flashback will lead him to putting the diary back in the end his need for revenge was a wasted effort it leads to the death of the person he really loves his grandma and his mother had a hand in her own death by running a business that brutalized people like nan
that is all thyme has to do to fix his past im not sure about the girlfriend if they were dating before or after the diary from the sounds of it he was using her as a replacement for him for his grandma if something happened to him it is a good possibility she is no longer needed his life if he isnt out for revenge
im fairly sure that we will now be in greats altered timeline they will bump into each other at the hospital but this time thyme will take notice of great as well just as a hot guy we will get a few moments where thyme backs away from great but 4 minute loops so they get close they fall in love since neither one of them is involved in the casino or exposing it neither one will get shot when they both wake up it will mostly likely be in bed together instead of a hospital there is a chance the casino does get exposed by someone else and great does get shot if so he will wake up to have thyme at his side as a boyfriend
since we are on the altered timeline the walking diaster area of klas life wont have happened but i still suspect that things arent going to end well there kla desperate need for raw sex from korn most likely is coming from the fact they started their relationship without condoms and now korn is using them kla has to realize at this point that korn is sleeping with someone else he wasnt korns boy toy at the start korn was helping him get away from his dad and they were in love korn promised he would come out after college and they would be together their college days are long gone and he is still lying in front of kla and now sleeping with others kla has been fooling himself but in episode1 you could see it wasnt working anymore
with the altered timelines korn has no reason to change thing the girl doesnt have leverage to force him into marriage and he is clueless about klas potential for murder but just because dome isnt dead doesnt mean that kla is going to let things stay that way in episode 7 we see the black cat run across the gun when kla realizes that great was helped kill dome and he is korns brother we also seen that black cat in episode 1 korn stops sex to answer a phone call lies and says he is with his girlfriend right in front of kla and then runs out the door to go to dinner with his dad every single thing there is something horrible to do in front of your boyfriend
im fairly sure the black cat is a harbinger of death in klas mind it was impetus for him to kill his dad it was there when he decided to kill great if dome hadnt died im fairly sure that kla would have ended up killing korn for being a terrible boyfriend
as for the casino and everything tied to it i have no clue this last episode showed us it is the fiances dad that actually is the terrible bad guy in all this while the episode itself felt like a retread of stuff that was easy to assume it did gives small details to shade in the story surprisingly greats dad isnt as much of an asshole as we thought moms ruled the day as villains in this story it was greats mom that actually started the business down the black path of illegal crap it was also thymes mom that brought the northern casinos and bootstrapped greats dads business into the casino business greats dad actually didnt want thymes parents killed at all
of course it is the fiances dad that is ultimate bad guy he killed thymes parents and seems to be the driving forced behind the casinos i suspect there will be some kind of way that he ends up dead or in jail by the end of the show but i dont know where it will happen
with there being only 1 more episode what ever they do it isnt going to feel satisfying this last episode was a wasted episode it added minor details but it didnt do a great deal to expand on the 4 minute loop or even add big details to the story going around right now great and thyme feel more like broken strangers 1 more episode isnt going to change that any ending with them together isnt going to leave a believable ending have one or both died would feel like why did we even bother they also have to deal with the casino aspect which once again will feel shallow because the amount of time they can devote to it kla and korn need a tie up as well at this point they only have a single episode to tie up stuff and they havent come close to doing that yet
to be honest the most fascinating story in this show has been klas they needed to get rid of all this supernatural junk and made this a murder love story and this would have been an amazing show


to be honest the most fascinating story in this show has been klas they needed to get rid of all this supernatural junk and made this a murder love story and this would have been an amazing show
kla is the star i dont understand why they have jes bible doing all the press when they are just side characters we know nothing about by ep7 while we know everything about kla and have seen more of his story and more screentime with him than with jesbible
yes make kla kill everyone and then stay with win in a one sided love win loves him kla uses him forever win is the closest we have to love in this alleged boyslove story

i love your theories my guess is anything you wrote even most boring case scenario will be more satisfying than what we see next week
i think one thing still missing for me  and i wonder what you think  is what the heck this lakwa thing is all about the fact that we see her and great in the 4 minutes room is never explained it has to mean something or its just bad writing
as for fuaizkla i didnt watch strong girl namsoon but i followed the hype around it which was all about byeon woo seok who played the villain no one really supported the actual main couple and certainly not the ml played by ong seong woo at the end of the day people watched for bws and he was the main character
thats exactly what 4m reminds me of i dont know if it was intentional but the most compelling actor and character is fuaiz playing kla im left wondering if pond and sammon knew that  especially as they focused so much of the ncs on fuaiz or are they that clueless theres such a disconnect between the marketing of this series and its content
this is not a romance and jesbible dont have scorching chemistry this is a psychological thriller with a complex villain as the lead are the creators not aware of what they made i genuinely want to ask them if theyre aware of this disconnect and why theyre trying to market any of it as sultry imo they look like fools
cc uthoughtsallday
ok now it links to ep1s scene  but now im lost with mhok seeing 11am please dont tell me nothing happen in the end

if jes doesnt survive bible aint surviving either and we may get the last scene with two of them on canoe and time 1104
else someone has to ensure jess reaches hospital too
good thing is  he is shot in abdomen both times and not in chestheart so maybe is meant to survive
jess has read the 4 minutes research so that should help him to regain consciousness from his dream world we already saw that bible regained it with his eyelids shaking when jess was talking to him
the open mystery  why did lookwa see bible in that 4 min room do jess and bible also meet


voluntarily heisted by yinwar happily murdered by firstkhao
thinking about this more the suicide lady is what really kicks off the sequence of events its because of that event that great starts to really shutdown his compassion letting dome and nan die etc for such an important character we dont know a lot about her unless i missed it why did her son die and why did she blame greats family for it was he just some random worker in their gambling operation or is there more to it
if she wasnt so important i think the story could have started with domes death and there wouldnt be much change to the story another vengeful family member maybe related to nan or mon could have hired the hitman to shoot at greathis mum and that still would have made sense
updated predictions  how i think it should end
in the scenario that the entire og and greats alternate timeline is retconned something would have to change before this event so that the suicide lady doesnt try to kill herself with greats car maybe tymes alternate timeline will correct this and he stops his parents from helping set up this gambling operation in the first place and they both live in this hea timeline but in realityog both are dead
or we see tyme attempt to correct the timeline in his 4 minutes alternate reality but isnt able to change much for some reason i keep thinking about the thai milk tea that he gives great how did he know great likes that drink he said he asked around but what random person is going to reveal something so specific and to a total stranger suss perhaps some of the moments weve already seen were from tymes perspective already i think the only thing tyme will be able to change for the better is greats demise but tyme dies  which is why we dont see him in the 4 minutes room with lukwa and great
gosh my head hurts too much for a saturday morning i dont know how yall did this for weeks

i think the only thing tyme will be able to change for the better is greats demise but tyme dies  which is why we dont see him in the 4 minutes room with lukwa and great
i also had the theory once cause i feel like they change every 4 minutes lol that they are in that room right before waking up like a waiting room for being released from the hospital so what you say totally makes sense tyme rescuing great but dying in the process i could see that unfortunately 


its the child actor from century of love  so nice to see him again and his acting is superb as always also im amazed by jjays height every time i see him its so funny when the other cops look like teenage girls beside him  plus i love how consistent tonklas character is he didnt turn bad bc of domes death its always been who he is i can sort of understand why he took matters into his own hands now only one episode left and gosh am i stressed i cant imagine how this is going to end is this one of the series where all good people have their lives ruined while the bad guys escaped scot free dang 


he didnt turn bad bc of domes death its always been who he is i can sort of understand why he took matters into his own hands now
i keep wondering if kla killed anyone else between the dad and these killings now 
im also sure someone killed korns mom very likely korns fiances dad

ok i watched again this time with good subtitles
i can understand ton kla perfectly the police system is corrupt and the only decent policeman is completely useless he got the usb at night and did he really have no time in sending the video to his phone or email really damn win the only thing you are good at is fuing
he did the right thing killing his father an abuser title a psycopath and great even if we like him he is rotten and got his empathy when he was shot
ton klas look when he saw great and korns picture is revealing i wonder if he will kill korn too for thinking he is covering for great
tyme what a naive fool you are did you really think that someone who killed your parents would let your grandma and you live going to greats dad to show him porn was beyond stupid
warit is the devil incarnate and unless someone kills him drectly he wont be touched by law if police covered for a brat son of a policeman imagine what they would do to cover for a mob boss
i wonder if tyme and great will find each other in the limbo and will wake up or will die together
i know its practically impossible but i would like to see what happens with ton kla korn and win
will korn kill win to protect ton kla will ton kla kill korn for being greats brother
i think ton kla will die like new did in dff after taking his revenge
i think its impossible wrap this thing up in just one episode but after thinking a while i want to have faith

warit is the devil incarnate and unless someone kills him directly
im waiting for tyme to do the job during his 4 minutes timeline 


late to the party this week because i work everyday ew and i am so tired
wow literally everyone in this show is a piece of shit except the inspector and dome ton kla will kill title  which is what we saw him do in an earlier episode and then go for great  hell work out great was involved somehow
the inspector is a bit shit tbh hes too pure for the world hes in ton klas brain has been damaged from the abuse of his father and meth hes 100 a psychopath does ton kla know great is korns brother im still not even sure ton kla and korn are together in the real timeline oh so he does know theyre brothers this is running commentary as i watch
nooooooo the psychopathic smile
honestly i dont even know whos side im on here i dont like any of these people anymore dr den ok i only like this guy
i wonder whos voice will snap great out of it hmmmmmmmm or maybe hell just die on the table does thyme actually care about great time and decisions lobe how sammon always has some deeper moral in her stories feels like shes strayed from the happy endings since the days of manner of death and triage though
oh my fucking god shooting his grandma over facetime is fucking depressing
im ready for 4 minuteception whos memories are we in today 
korns mum couldnt help and you want to sign the divorce papers oooooooft theres tea there
oh so thymes parents were shitheads too and he knew great as a kid aw baby great feeding little thyme
man swirling a glass of red wine and smiling about murder always a psychopath  who is warit have we seen him before omfg find the book tyhme thats gonna have so many answers
oh this scene is familiar
fuck im so stressed is great now dead
is thyme gonna have his 4 minutes now is this him just recreating a memory where he finds the book and somehow that holds all the answers for him so in reality he clearly left the diary behind and in his little 4 minute trance hell read it and itll provide all his answers which wont even be real
i see no way this show has a happy end how the hell are they gonna wrap this up in one episode


that journal is what thyme read and that is when he started his revenge mission in his revised memories now he is contemplating not reading the journal or reading it more accurately  last time he didnt get the part where his mom wrote she was sorry to him  because this entire mess is actually thymes parents fault cause they were the gambling den ogs also that note from the mom is similar to the note on the coffee cup that kept changing with great when thyme apologized while great was unconscious that might be why great saw the cup message changing

warit is korns fiances dad and very friendly with greats mom i think greats mom asked warit to kill korns mom tbh yes we have seen him several times korns fiance always tells korn that her dad can fix things and korns dad keeps saying that warit is the cleaner upper in the family this is why korn can never leave his fiance
halfway through cos i was going crazy with all the theories ive decided to stop liking or not any of the characters and just be awed by their acting 


watching ep 6 and 7 back to back was so intense tbh and i like how these two episodes tie up everything together little greatyme were so adorable tt cant believe just one more episode to go now


once its over a binge rewatch is a must knowing what everything means will likely allow us to see more things in earlier episodes that we must have missed
baby great afraid of woof woof

great still afraid of woof woof


combined scenes

this is the first bl ive ever watched and im hoping for even the smallest semblance of a happy ending lol pleaseee tonkla  korn and great  tyme plsplspls

question what did i miss that tymes parents to blame for the gambling ring


greats dads shippinglogistics business was going under it needed money fast to survive he went to his mistress greats mom the scene where baby great and his mom were playing and the dad walked in and told her his mistress that his wife korns mom was unable to help him with his business so his mistress greats mom told him she might be able to help him she said that she knew some investors that could help get him money fast she introduced him to thymes parents thymes parents were successful owners of gambling dens like the one grown up thyme hates that greats dad runs now so thymes parents are the ones that introduced greats parents into the gambling den business thyme wrongfully assumed his parents were poor and were working for greats dad to earn whatever money they could to feed their family but his parents were actually rich tyme didnt realize this cause he was little and lived with his grandma who was poor thymes mom dropped him off at grandmas cause their business was dangerous and they were being hunted much like greats parents are fleeing from now
its the second last episode and i am confused as fck what will be the ending  tyme died and suddenly he was in front of a clock  i know that diary has some insane things in it but still like what is even true atp 

after this episode i actually have hope for the finale
the woman from the study says ive been thinking about how i came out of seeing 4 minutes in the future because if i didnt come to my senses i wouldve been stuck there forever and in the real world i would probably be dead 
and then when tyme regrets his actions and says it will haunt him till the day he dies dr den answers but sometimes we might have a chance to resolve any lingering feelings  suggesting that there is a way to change things
for me it means that its not just a dreamfantasy there are indeed alternate realities and they can choose which one they stay in but it might also mean dying in the others ones
if great died in the reality having heart attack  in his 4 minutes one being shot maybe its to live in tyme 4 minutes reality where everything can still be fixed


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
the animal cruelty at the beginning caught me off guard i wasnt ready for it its the one thing that i absolutely cannot stand and sends me into a state of panic immediately the thought of someone doing that to a defenceless little creature takes a fucked up person with a power trip i went to lovingly pet my cat straightaway


up top i add the warnings  for each episode in case people get upset by different things  im sorry it caught you off guard
can somebody explain the story to me   i feel so dumb reading these comments i have no idea what is going on and the timelines are irritating me    but ik its a good movie so i want to watch it
will probably rewatch it after learning the story line


is great his dads biological son  im confused 
edit for the spoiler

this show is testing my patience and my sanity
i was up till 5 this morning trying to figure out what will happen next week
there are so many possiblities left that i cant predict exactly what will happen
first of all dr den leaves tyme with his scientific study insisting that he should read it and that is a reaction to the immense regret tyme has after having seen great in a coma of a sort in the hospital and that he will regret his decisions untill the day he dies
and den is like well what if you can do your decisions once again but than differently
if that is really the case this show has a phantasy element and i am not buying that completely i think that it is more realistic cause the events can not change like in sammons earlier work triage or it can why should den be so insisting that tyme reads it because if you can not change it that will means that tyme is like great only imagining things in his head in the cardiac arrest phase
so i am stuck with that and also if certain decisions of tyme can be changed will that affect great cause he was shot not because of that but in relation to dome and tonkla and tyme was not even aware of that
and everything lukwa is saying that she would have been stuck in her 4 minutes into the future thing if she was not called out of it by her then boyfriend
what with the note on the tea in a earlier episode that tyme wrote forgive me great will that play a role next week
i get a headache just thinking about all the possiblities
and last night i thought well for tonkla and win i dont see a future in fact i think that tonkla will die leaving win heartbroken
but for great and tyme i saw possiblities
but now no i think that one of those two dies or stay forever in a coma
i just have to wait for next week
dff left us with a ending that was much the subject of debate and that everyone could interpret as whatever they wanted it is possible that 4 minutes is leaving us with a outcome of that sort
the whole cast is excellent bas as korn was a pleasant surprise but fuaisz i still can not get over it how he plays this role and he is still that young incredibly talented



he told him to read his research because he wanted him to read the part the girl told dr den about the voice of her boyfriend pulling her out of the 4min loop since thyme hasnt explicitly told den that great is his boyfriend den was being cautious and not outright telling thyme hey go talk to your boyfriend cause it may pull him out of this
thats why after thyme read it he went to talk to great and great heard his voice and that is what triggered the revised prettier version of events in greats mind which is what we saw in previous episodes
