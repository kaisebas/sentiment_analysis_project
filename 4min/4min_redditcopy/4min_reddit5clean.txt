just dropping hubby off at work things 

fr i was like is there gonna be a goodbye kiss cause thats what married couples do 

yes theyre married already father inlaw mr rogers cant keep them apart 

so hot


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
how did i never notice what a fine ass bible has when he was in kinnporsche was i just blinded by his fine face

boc kept it a secret

enjoy and prepare your self for the end 

it was sad he had to see his mom die


agreed although its kinda what i was expecting i was expecting it later for some reason


so far everything has been in line with what many predicted and the photos jes posted this morning honesly were helpful to me in preparing for that ending 



maybe a girl can hope the shooting happening so early means we dont have bible dead in the end and time moves forward once hes saved  wishful thinking probably maybe next week we start 4 minutes for tyme 
is no one gonna get w dr den hes so big and hot and cute such a waste

lukwa should claim him theyd be cute together


bocs cinematography
i agree their smiles are so cute though the doctor patient thing but oh well this isnt real
boc better give job some love in a future series

is she really his patient or just a patient from the hospital he invited to question for his research im not sure but also yeah who cares 


dr den be looking like theb burj khalifa someone climb this man

love bible commitment to die or almost in every project he does


another parallel is that he needed to deal with grandmas in both series 

arent entirely accurate
so is this never happening im distraught 


hence why the guitar was making me distraught and why i cried when i saw the guitar cause omfg whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy did they waste time with guitars before he got shot ugh now we need to deal with trauma
however i did read the rules for the finale screening and it says the same thing as ep4 about 18 so i am hopefully we will get that scene at some point and it is not just flashes

im actually screaming that poor guitar he just wanted to be played
18 for the finally weve gotten so much already but i want to b greedy 

wait noooo i will riot if not still 3 eps to go 
i am wondering if there is a separate timeline for tyme because at the end we see flashes of him with blood on his nose and we know that he gets shot at some point so it might be that it happened in that timeline as opposed to this one idk

omg wait at the start of the 1st episode we see tyme get shot so are we the audience living out both tyme  greats not entirely accurate memoriesexperiences in jumbled order

i was just saying this in another comment but it occurred to me that we could actually have 3 timelines  a the original b greats and then c tymes because weve now seen tonkla seemingly kill title in two different timelines if we assume that the person he killed in the beginning scene of one of the eps a few weeks ago was also title since they didnt show it to us
but yeah i definitely think there are at least two and we must get to see them somehow because theres both the bar scene  the pool table etc and i dont see how those could happen after the events so far lol
another possibility that someone on twitter pointed out is that maybe great relives it again but this time tries to save things differently i guess well see


yk what i think when tyme would be shot we might see him reliving his memories for 4 mins wtf
the black and white color coding between great and tyme is a bit too heavyhanded for my taste
but damn bible is styled so well in this series every article of clothing he wears sits on his body just right

the black and white color coding between great and tyme is a bit too heavyhanded for my taste
its so on the nose it has to mean sth right 


agreed but also yes bible looks stunning i tagged on the post an insta account that keeps track of every bible outfit in the series and in all the photoshoots

i can do it with a broken heart
i think depending on where we are in the timeline greats white clothing is gradually mixed with black so the further down the unraveling if the mystery we get the more black hes wearing but thats just me and my addled brain at 140 am
thai mr rogers is so bad omg 


bocs cinematography
this scene was so fucking tense i actually found it more tense than any of the threatening scenes with kinn in kinnporsche mr rogers is the real mafia boss right here

grandma looked like she needed a diaper change stat everytime he smiled i got the heebiejeebies 
him saying ptyme is so cute


i think i can safely speak for a lot of us and say omg wtf 

def so

now why the hell is this show only 8 episodes you mean to tell me yall can wrap it all up in the next 3 eps
i feel like we only just started act 2 of a multiact series i wonder why they didnt push for at least 12 episodes theres so much more stories to tell
aww how can peeps not see korns heart hes willing to do all the bad stuff so great can just live a normal life he loves his bb brother so much 


i saw his heart i believe him to be good inside finally
i really love his characterization so far any other similar character like korn would have completely descended into evil by episode 2 or 3 but were more than halfway through and were still second guessing if hell be the final villain at the end or not
its great that they show how he genuinely loves tonkla and deeply cares for great we love a complex character

from the first episode i could tell hes a good guy and he puts up with a lot and is more than willing to put up with it for the people he loves 


cause of death the heart killers 
today it happened i felt his heart breaking when faisai refered to tonkla as that boy his eyes told me he wasnt just a boy for him

doesnt matter if hes getting his brother happy by destroying someone elses life  keep that shit to urself tbh the fact lorn knew that gambling thing harmed some ppl and said it was for the company tbh fck him as well i thought he was better  the entire family can rot in hell atp 

i love korn and where theyre taking his character you can really feel how impossible it is for him he cares about people and wants to love them he also wants to prove himself to his father but hes really been put in an impossible situation he cant have both


clearly i have been doing camping wrong all my life
also i decided to go back and watch ep 14 because it wasnt available in my area and the subs i found were horrible i figured proper translation might help the story a bit
i totally forgot about the opening scene with tyme being shot hes wearing the same clothes as the end of ep 5 this is where binging everything all at one time helps you dont forget details from a month ago
update well after starting the rewatch to figure out what i missed
iqiyi is not showing the sultrier version at least not on the app on my roku tv
where exactly was the black cat with tonkla in the beginning
update to my update
iqiyi does have the sultrier version i went to watch ep 5 within 10 minutes of it being released and there was only one option now they are both there my bad operator error
i found the cat it was a blink and you miss moment


or watching every episode 10 timesi recognized the clothes right away maybe next week we get tymes 4 minutes vs greats from 14


i couldnt really rewatch them that much the versions i was finding were ads every few minutes and had horrible translations usually grace instead of great she instead of he and completely missing full sentences


3 things after that episode
why is this series only 8 episodes 
im confused
bible  helllooooooo


what time stamp was 

is this a clue


sammon supervising


ive noticed that a lot of these authors are really young im not sure why i always assumed they would be older epi 5 is airing tomorrow and not today right

are we finally getting a few answers today  that we might have already
but whats up with the dometonkla stuff so all the seeing into the future stuff great flipping the script on title etc was greats not entirely accurate experiencesmemories but then why was ghost dome in an uber going home like whats good thats so sad  lol


the cat in ep1 told me they had to be hallucinations

omgg wait that makes sense he hasnt fed it again or worried about it at all lmao
ok i just finished the episode and i was caught off guard when great was with his mom  also it took me a good min to realize that time had blood on his nose as well makes me wonder what happened in the other timeline


also it took me a good min to realize that time had blood on his nose as well



this episode was the most tense omg
never felt at ease like the past ones not even in the most peaceful scenes
i can say that what everything happened in this episode was about to happen soon or later
still im still wow after ive seen it

i am so  after that episode
like
still trying to absorb everything we saw and howwhether it makes sense

i demand more shy bottom bible

i demand it too i need giggly bible again


bocs cinematography
holy fucking shit
im willing to eat crow about korn bass facial acting during his scene with fasai where she said hed have to marry her  damn the way he swallowed down his feelings for tongkla because he knew he was painted into a corner jesus it hurt so much that i felt it lodged in my throat too that was him killing his love for tongkla to save his familys reputation bro its not worth it
is title fasais brother the cold openings obviously arent in chronological order so we are seeing how tongkla must have gotten title before he killed him i assume one thing im curious about is if win actually knew about tongklas fingerprints on the rock before he went to help him with domes funeral that phone call he got during that one cold open could have been when tongkla was asking for help so maybe weve kind of been misinterpreting some of the looks on wins face obviously he has feelings for tongkla but maybe theres more conflict there because he knows hes fallen for a murderer and is either trying to cover it up and thus be just as corrupt as his boss or trying to get close to tongkla for evidence i dunno  i feel like there is more going on to that relationship than meets the eye just a hunch
jesus so great went back in time to save his mother and it didnt fucking matter she died anyway the actor playing his mom did such a good job in that scene all the women were spectacular this episode nan was great and so was manee just the rage she had inside of her bubbled out of her gaze too bad it was the wrong side of the family that got killed
there was no sense of calm in this episode everything was on a knifes edge that dinner scene at tymes house was so tense even when they were at that gorgeous campsite it felt like a dream but one you know youre going to wake up from and its going to be total shit when you do wake up so its not even comforting and it all just became a nightmare for great as soon as he kissed tyme goodbye in the car everything in his life fell through his fingers he and korn fought and korn blocked him tyme was threatened and ditched him at least from greats pov his familys foundation was built on a pile of shit and then he tries to save his mom from dying and she dies anyway and now hes on deaths door  fuck i love this show
this blue shirt that tyme is wearing is the shirt he was wearing when he got shot in the beginning of episode 1 so are we going to see tymes 4 minutes now will this show end where they are both just dead and korn marries someone he doesnt love and the man he loves goes to prisonis executed for killing the son of a prominent and dangerous man honestly i would kind of love that i know that everyone wants happy endings but i kind of love that with dff and now this sammon is just like fuck your happy ending hahahaha queen behavior
edit perhaps the campground that great just found without knowing where it was is purgatorylimbo and they are both dying they both want to stay there but cant i said above its like a dream you dont want to wake up from but maybe thats literal this is the last place they can be together


cherry magic 
one thing im curious about is if win actually knew about tongklas fingerprints on the rock before he went to help him with domes funeral
same i was wondering if win knew
perhaps the campground that great just found without knowing where it was is purgatorylimbo and they are both dying they both want to stay there but cant
the black and white clothes and the fact that nothing is moving there even trees there is not wind no animal no time no other people all those facts make the scene dreamy and not real at all so i kind of share that idea of purgatory or at least a place where their visionconsciousness merge together
okay so my incoherent thoughts
i was really not expecting the end of this episode because tbh i thought that we wouldnt see the scenes where tyme  great get hurt until the last episode but now its already happened for great which has kind of thrown that idea on its ear haha but every time i think i know what to expect for next week i am thrown for a loop
i am tentatively wondering if the other timeline that we see flashes of is tymes timeline we see him with blood on his nose at the end and then without just like we saw tonkla with and without dome in the last episode weve known all along that there are different versions of events but now i am wondering if whats going to happen is that now were going to see tymes version perhaps ep 6  7 tell the story from that timeline and then ep 8 wraps everything up
i find it really interesting how we see a contrast in passitivity from korn vs great actively choosing action in all his changes korn feels helpless and as though he has no way out even though there are likely choices available to him if hed just take them he doesnt though which just leads to him getting mired deeper
i really really hope that this wraps up well because theres so much going on i appreciate how much sammon packs into her shows but theres the lady and her son theres nan and her friend theres kornwintonkla and then theres tyme and great but on the other hand now that we kind of know the overarcing plot i guess now we have three episodes to solve it but im worried that theres still even more going to be packed in and that its going to be a kind of unsatisfying ending
i also cant help but wish that we had more time with tyme and great this episode was 48 minutes and i feel like they could have added another ten minutes or so and had some more time for them out at the campsite thing
we will never be safe from a guitar scene in thai bl lol
im locked innnnnn and i swear this pic boc is using is tulkan im losing my mind 


i hate guitars so much though 



the guitar annoyed me but what really set me off was tyme talking about not being happy it might be a translation issue but it doesnt sound good from any angle ive explored
great would be justified in literally kicking him out of the hammock they had just spent a steamy night together that is the kind of moment you are supposed to say cheesy stuff like until i met you to avoid hurting your lovers feelings
tyme hurt great again in the same scene with his i have nothing to lose line im surprised that great kept his cool after that remark

okay honestly i am usually a certified guitar hater x1000 but i actually didnt mind it here like i thought the gentle song was kinda cute and added to the dreamysurreal feeling of the camp site like they got transported and are suddenly inhabiting a cute bl sceneset somehow in the middle of their shared nightmare

lmao

holy fucking shit guys omfg prepare for the ending of this episode read the warnings i posted up top if you need to ask me questions about the warnings before you go in if you are scared to go in jesus christ

8 episodes feels too short for this series im worried its going to be a rushed ending thats not really satisfying 

well damn

ifylita 1 fan 


its like all of us are deadbut without the zombieskorn has the weight of the world on his shoulders that he has to trade the love of his lifehe doesnt want to disappoint his fatherhe wants to protect greathe wants to love tonkla freelyyoure boxed in the corneris fasai really the only way outassassins in the templesuicidal lady who jumped in front of greats car was not randomif he did not save her he would have saved his mother a vicious cyclei hope great and tyme survives thisotherwise it will be a very sad sad ending


bocs cinematography
anyone else getting a network error from viu when they try to get to the 4 minutes landing page

im fairly sure that viu has now blocked vpns since its available on other platforms internationally i ended up watching on iqiyi


yall i loved todays episode like i liked it better than the all episodes so far so that means great was just reliving his memories in those four minutes and what could be have done differently none of it was real shit it makes sense but i do have a lot of questions like going by this theory if that woman that great saved supposedly died in the real world then who sent the goon to kill his family 

i cant even form thoughts on this series anymore i almost just wanna go into it surprised without any theories 
so tonkla is def gonna kill title bc he knows thats who killed his brother but also hes still alive in another timeline wtf
i still dont like korn tbh i get that hes stuck but he could do the right thing and even if he needs to get married to that woman he doesnt need to actually romance her and kiss her hand like that lol shes calling tonkla is boy toy but shes basically using korn as hers
im glad we got more greattyme but at what cost  

also greats conversation with korn reminded me of the story the ones who walk away from omelas by ursula k le guin
its about a utopian society that secretly relies upon the utter suffering of one child but when the citizens find out about this they have a choice to remain in the paradise or to leave and never come back
great is like the ones who walk away because they dont want to live in a place that is made from someone else suffering


great is like the ones who walk away because they dont want to live in a place that is made from someone else suffering
i would walk too like how do you even sleep at night dude


 ep5 is live on gaga
 ep 5 is live on iqiyi
i linked it up top too


just wondering why boc ended their exclusive deal with viu and made it available everywhere and we are already half way through they should have done this at the beginning is it because theres a glitch in viu thailand i could not get in there i am redirected and none of their videos are playing sad they did not anticipate the popularity of their product hope they fix it soon since there goes another premium subsc


it was set up for exclusivity for 4 eps gaga gave a hint on aug 6 that they would get it after that deal
viu gave them more money to be exclusive

yoooo waiiit you mean to tell me we had to sit through a guitar scene in such a good show why 


1 guitar scene and 1 threatening guitar scene where they just showed us the guitar like it could be played any minute it was so hard


not very demure am i using it right 

no sexy time but still awesome why is that scene in the beginning look like their honeymoon tho
my new theory is that this is like triage theyve lived through all of this before and the visions great has been seeing is their previous go around or at least thats one of my theories 


earthmix 
im as confused as the beginning lol but this is so good i was owed a morning after though we deserve it at this point im obsessed with these two they have clicked so well that i hope we get to see them work again in the future i cannot believe we are just three episodes away from the finale im not ok


welcome to my ted talk everyone been dead thats the end hope yall enjoyed


what a tense episode like a quiet on the edge of your seat kind of tense
do we know how korns mom died was she sick of was she pushed out to make room for greats mom aka the mistress who got the gambling den off the ground and worked hard to get her and her son out of the shadows  her pushing korn into the illegal side of the business to make room for great to take over the clean side oof
i want so bad for korn to just let the familyfamily business go up in flames put yourself first korn
hard agree with the comments that suggest the campsite being purgatorylimbo everything just felt too calm too still too peaceful now does white represent death or does black 
with the shot heard around the world things seem to be getting ready to wrap up but in three episodes feels like this should be a ten episode series not eight 
i am confused
i held my breath and ff with the intense stuff
i am confused

so what we followed was greats memories and the mistakes he wished to erase it seems the first version of events where the real ones and dome is in fact rip makes sense he was looking to the past with the knowledge of the future lets see what we get from now on exciting i dont believe we will have a hea with this oneughhhhi should have knowni was not strong enough to avoid starting to watch it now we suffers2g


me sympathising with korn is pretty much on brand  why am i like this


so greats mom heads the investment scam she was the primary target by the temple hitmanshe was saying how she worked so hard to get where they are if not for her hard work they would still live in a small house somewhereso she was the mistress even before korns mom died i deducekorns and greats age are not that far apartdid great grew up sheltered and cuddledeven older stepbro korn wants to let him live his carefree life and korn will do everything himsefwhy does he have a diffrent moral compass than the rest of his familyis it his inherent characteris this why he didnt blink an eye on what dr tyme revealed and instead readily helped dr tymeor was it because he was dying and wished to change the outcome to save his mother

im still confused
probably more so now
wtf is happening
like i get it but i dont
bless the breeze always a sight to behold

them looking at each others lips before the cute kiss 


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
guitar scenes make me cringe


same thankfully this was short but not gonna lie when they showed me the guitar again by the picnic table i did scream wtf no not again stop it

hmm so her son aint nobody interesting
me hoping that either he knows how to play that thing or the guitar is just for the photos


the way i screamed when i saw that guitar last night  i honestly would have been less horrified if they had confirmed that both may be dead honestly this morning when jes and bible sort of confirmed that great is in fact having a heart attack i was calmer than when i saw that horrible guitar

he can play the guitar and drums
he has videos on his instagram where he plays and sings

so am i the only one the show isnt showing up in iqiyi for
oh also who was the lady at the temple the other person who sees in the future

the woman who got hit by greats car in the beginning
that was crazy good  i am so excited for next weeks episode 


ok i thought we would have answers in this episodes and it was just more questions
i would never have thought they would dare to kill great so soon of course he will come back somehow but we thought that this was the new timeline and he ended up almost dying like the original one or this was the original one
greats murder was ordered by the woman he saved oh delicious irony as rumor says the road to hell is paved with good intentions
by the way the guy who killed great here is the same who killed tyme in the first episode
httpsxcomevulienka3status1827037367301284032
den says that one of possible effects of cardiac arrest is fix their mistakes and having supernatural powers so we cant discard the fantasy element here
i think its pretty confirmed that tonkla killed title in revenge for his brother

greats murder was ordered by the woman he saved oh delicious irony
maybe its more like karma is a bitch and no one can escape her since originally great committed a hit and run on that poor woman i mean hes trying to make things better but somehow it still ends up a shit pile or its like in triage where the mc needs to find the right thing to change otherwise the ml just keeps on dying over and over again


yes

i thought maybe pre credits were running in order but that would mean tonkla killed someone else with a rock
dr den who draws circles for some reason said that when patients have a cardiac arrest they relive past experiences some have supernatural powers some go back to fix past mistakes and some get a fresh start with those they love patients experiences feel real but arent entirely accurate if we just watched great go through this with only a minute left im with the guesses that tymes 4 minutes are next and it will be a different version of events there has to be a reason weve seen things flash and change and then go back like the thai tea that said dont forget to treat your wound to im sorry great and back what really happened and why is manee hiring a hit man after greats family
the beginning seemed out of place why are they having a chilled picnic with everything going on lol great said he wishes he could stay forever but probably cant and tyme singing a song with the lyrics  if we could meet again my heart will still give it to you ill remember this day those memories forever to meet in the land of twilights veil in a world where time stands still its very ominous
i think id love any ending with this show its just too good 


great said he wishes he could stay forever but probably cant and tyme singing a song with the lyrics  if we could meet again my heart will still give it to you ill remember this day those memories forever to meet in the land of twilights veil in a world where time stands still its very ominous
in this entire part i was saying
they are both dead fuck omg they are both dead this is not reality they are in some limbo place dead or dying and this is where their subconscious took them
i can do it with a broken heart
noooow im caught up with everyone else lets see rubs hands together


i can do it with a broken heart
noooow im caught up with everyone else lets see rubs hands together
i wonder if tyme will come clean with great also i wonder if great realises korn probably did all the dirty work to shield his baby brother i love how tyme is wearing all black and great is wearing all white its almost as if theyre trying to tell us something
those beasts
can someone tell me what the difference between the cut and sultrier version was this week i definitely watched the sultrier version but was curious

their wasnt any sultrier scenes this episode so i guess not that much difference 


copying from a reply i made on another outlet im just going to accept that every theory i have is wrong and every idea i can think of is only part of the whole story i love how this keeps me on my toes i love puzzles and usually figure stuff outbut this one makes me feel stupid until the end which i usually have to make myself do so i dont give away the story for anything else i read or watch but figuring this out and still seeing something coming out of left field and not knowing how it impacts everything else i think i already know is incredible
these characters are becoming so much more than 2d every time i watch an episode i learn something new whether it be backstory motive emotionsand its all tying into a greater plot i cannot wrap my head around loving it so far


no more tonkla nc the comment section is dead this episode whoever was complaining about too much screen time for tonkla count your days


oh now i get it the woman that great hit  she paid for hitman that was moonlighting as a budhist priest very smart she did her big one revenge for her son i did feel bad for greats mum though she loves him regardless and he was being a brat


i feel bad that great had to watch her die right in front of him but she had done some terrible things in her life korn and especially his dad are still roaming around

  


can anyone tell me how long the sultry version of this ep is im having trouble finding out if im watching the right version or not


i too am confused

4811

im so confused ep 4 last scene we saw that guy tonklas bro was still alive and this episode it felt like im watching a whole new drama so many things happened and went above my head wym great died tbvh i dont think he can die thay easily he is the main character so many questions why did that guy shot him and his mom did his dad order who was he what was that lady praying for what was the purpose  i know she is somehow connected to this murder situation like she knows someone is gonna die n stuff after that paper with those words also i didnt expect tyme to be that selfish  man took the 5m and went on or maybe theres something mroe we dont know yet idk why i have a feeling theyre rushing the series why is it just 8 episodes man


tyme accepted the money for the gangsters to leave his grandmother alone i guess they would have killed both of them in the house if he did not accept
the lady at the shrine is the same lady from episode 1 from the car accident she gives money to an assassin to kill greats parents because they were responsible for her sons death the guy that shot graeat and his mom is the assassin from the shrine in the real timeline the lady died after the car accident so i guess the shrine scene happened before she was hit by great

im glad theyve clarified the general plot as this point but i still have questions
so exactly what is real and what was not i thought the 4minute explanation meant that people were hallucinating about going back in time to fix their mistakes that would imply that great saved the woman in the first place and thats how she managed to hire the hit man to kill himhis mom so is he trying to leave her there so she never comes after him
also in the first scene great ran away from tyme and later changed it so that he met tyme instead so does it mean the first time he never really met tyme at all or that he wished he drove away instead of coming back to save his mom
i get what theyre implying but the mechanics are still confusing to me or maybe im just reading too deep into this


i love this show wow the story is mind blowing its so unpredictable and the writing is soooo goood sammon nd the screenwriters did an amazing job and the actors i loooovvvveee iittt


i really need korn  his mommy and daddy to be killed by the end of this series no stupid redemption or forgiveness nonsense


im confused when he saw the future the mom wasnt shot until he was in the car when he got back to reality she was still begging him to apologize to his dad when he got shot every other incident lined up in his future visions but not this one and he didnt even change anything 


question are all episodes on gaga and iqiyi uncut versions


gaga should be uncut

the eighth sense  semantic error  atots  moonlight chicken
iqiyi has both versions at least in the uk


as much as i dont like korn i sympathise with him as he has gone through a lot and his the oldest son so he has to take up a lot of work given by his father with a lot of expectations i get why korn feels like everything is blamed on him his father is a piece of shit and his stepmother sees her son as he cannot do no wrong
