sultrier version is fucking peak boc really won 

jesus fcking christ i literally had to pause for a sec there they were not lying about the sultrier version woahhhh

like it kept going and the camera work was amazing holding shots and a good balance of tight shots and zoomed out shots gagged


lol this gif is literally both of us rn
yeah it was done masterfully a whole ass new benchmark right there everybody should learn from them

it gagged me up more than wayujaos scene in two worlds and i thought that was the best scene of the year this truly makes that look like something from star hunter lol

no pls dont remind me of big dragon 
havent watched two worlds yet but as for nc scenes its love sea for me this year well it was until now 

it was hot but i can see the heartbreak and frustration they will put me through

i know and after dff im worried about fuaiz literally praying for bb

cause of death the heart killers 
ok they really won and they are screwing us all with their shenanigans of vpn and stuff 

and now social media will do all the promo for them and make interfans even more ravenous when they finally announce a platform so evil


cause of death the heart killers 
actual footage of boc right now

boc posted an ig story of i think the audience in the theater screaming and covering their eyesmouths during the nc scene

i gasped  bc what is this
im at a loss for words and this rarely happens it was so soft and hard at the same time they looked phenomenal

yes its like so ott smut but still so sweet and romantic the same sort of vibe lie kinnporsche boc really knows how to give layers and show colors its truly amazing

34 minutes in you will absolutely fucking die i am absolutely dead kp nc scenes were disney compared to this can you fuck me raw so i can feel it jesus christ i cannot breathe
also ep1 overall stunning


i had to pause omg what did i just watch sjkskalalal


i am unalive right now 


i am surprised how good the camera angles were like i think havent seen in a bl yet


the camera angles improved tremendously from kp to dff but 4 minutes is on another level completely


bocs cinematography
whyyyyyyy do i have to still be at work for the next 5 hours


this is an emergency you need to leave work immediately
the cinematography is just so fucking kvnt this is why boc can treat its interfans like dog shit lol because hew else is doing it  this level 


bocs cinematography
nobody can touch them when it comes to cinematography
did not expect bible to be turning all these lewks tbh 

hes such a babe 


and hes supposed to be 21 a baby 


i could not focus on anything here cause that fit is absofuckinglutely stunning and breathtaking and like whoever thought of this is a genius and bible is a freaking work of art 

helpppppp


i immediately thought oh were getting this from bible too

in one of his lives he said this role really pushed him and challenged him in ways he didnt expect and jes was an amazing partner to go on this journey with so i think so he better lmao

i can see that challenged him to the moon using your gif btw 

i hope it challenged him good
i can do it with a broken heart
trust you to gift us with this gif orgy thank you for your service

i fell off the couch and died while yelling and screaming

i was eating chips and literally choked  all the screamingsounds they were making  i wonder if jjay is gonna be bas henchman and thats how him and fuaiz are gonna meet and it will be lub  first sight omg still dying

can we give a standing ovation to these ppl pls





his eye contact and eye acting was absolutely incredible
when he made his request and it looked like it was not gonna be granted his eyes immediately looked so sad and disappointed and the reaction from korn when he saw those eyes was to immediately rethink his opening of the condom and he looked at him deep in his eyes and said condom be dammed and threw it on the floor  and then here when he ensured his man came cause only one of them being satisfied was not right 

a gif says a thousand words heh

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
he sure did an a job in ep 1
i dont think ive ever seen an intimacy coordinatordirector credit in a bl or at least i never noticed

how i feel watching the nc scene
if i didnt wanna see this so bad id boycott it bc of bocs bad handling of internationalglobal release 
making fans wait years and now this


the ghosting is what has me livid i get it money talks they signed a deal with viu to use our love of bible to allow viu to softly enter new markets without needing to invest so in exchange viu gave them probably more money than they would for a viu original but then boc should say something or reply to the hundreds of messages posts asking for info on global streaming on their socials
they just needed to put out one post explaining and saying sorry guys we love you but we needed to do this to be able to make 4 minutes the way it deserved i would have understood
but putting out a warning to not watch on nonauthorized channels when there are no authorized channels except for 89 countries is insane and insulting while also providing instructions and time lines on how to make the series trend they had time to create three instruction posts but could not do one addressing the lack of global platform ugh
why do they keep doing this to bible bible needs to find a new company 


but putting out a warning to not watch on nonauthorized channels when there are no authorized channels except for 89 countries is insane and insulting while also providing instructions and time lines on how to make the series trend they had time to create three instruction posts but could not do one addressing the lack of global platform ugh
that was so insensitive just making is walk the plank


ive been waiting for weeks to see if they will say iqiyi and i am just disturbed at this limited release jesbible deserve me paying to watch them weekly and screaming im hurt any word on when we may get to watch legally


zero word from boc they are ghosting  us 


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
they just needed to put out one post explaining and saying sorry guys we love you but we needed to do this to be able to make 4 minutes the way it deserved i would have understood
this is exactly whats pissing me off the most
i mean how hard would it be to just acknowledge the fact instead of ignoring the elephant in the room

gagginggggg screaming
bas i did not know you had that in you lol



i kept yelling basssss what what omfg what is happening why did they hide you all this time 

fuaiz and bas was not a couple i saw happening but dang they look good together fuaiz is a baby though just turned 18 last january


fuaizs eyes are so incredibly expressive he gave us an entire character breakdown and a full monolog just through his eyes in that entire nc scene

 bad guy bosskateer 
i am mesmerized by his eyes they are the prettiest most expressive eyes ive ever seen how is he pulling sexy puppy eyes  l literally cannot watch his eyes enough
it is kind of fierce how boc is so seemingly unbothered lol



viu doesnt even give the 1st episode free like most streamers do jeez
bible he is such a babe im so excited for him also when he couldnt light the cig and he shook his head sigh and said god i died i replayed like so many times is unhealthy
fuaiz is 18 years old he is so young i didnt know that 
that was insane something that caught my attention is that one of the doctors is studying cardiac arrests and a woman gave the example that she could see 4 minutes in the future and here the same thing happens to great could be the dude at the beggining him ans thats how he got this power
why do i find shoulder kisses like this more sexual than the act itself and fuaiz  i have the tendency to still call him white  postcoital look is beautiful


the way they melted into each other was spectacular
also we kept thinking white had something up his sleeve over at dffand here we are this was what we were sensing over there 

flashbackkk


omg was this a hint about the power of his shoulders  like they needed to be covered and protected cause they knew we would self destruct if we knew 
trust the thrust asking  does it hurt shows how much you acknowledge the feelings of your partner love it
but i am sensing a different kind of hurt coming for tonkla very soon right
firstkhao sandray akkayan kantbison 
im ready to throw my money and support a well made bl project if only they allow me  wellvpn it is
wow guys the cinematic production quality of it is superb im buzzing with excitement  also bible speaking english again 


it is a crime that they are limiting viewing when clearly they put forth so much effort into the production 


yeah its just rude and honestly its on them now im watching it somewhere else  if they release it on an international platform like gaga ill gladly watch it again so they can have my money as a support

a very strong start interesting plot good acting great nc scene i was depressed my stand in ended but this will fill its place
 bad guy bosskateer 
that nc scene was so hot so tender so early that im worried one of them is going to die

earthmix 

 if i ever get kissed like this i will melt like butter on a hot skillet 


earthmix 

its the most natural thing to do cause your body cant lie it irks me in situations where couples who have been apart for a while or have made up after a big disagreement barely share a kiss or a proper hug to mark the occasion what in the world is that about anyway
welp this was seriously mind blowing you guys im mind blown actually everything blown


i am unalive i am in shock but also cannot stop rewatching and my mouth is still on the floor
kp was nickelodeon compared to this hbo max

listen i was so ready to throw my hard earned money at another streaming site just for this show i really was but then boc pulled this crap and left me no choice i will definitely pay to rewatch the right way if and when they announce a global streaming site but in the meantime ive waited too long
if boc does nothing else right they will give you a quality production and i mean everything and everyone was so good the pacing the acting the cinematography
the nc scene was  but also kinda soft bas and fuaiz were so sweet with each other
bas stood out so much to me glad hes getting the chance to shine and i love that bible and bas have a good sibling relationship for a second there i was convinced otherwise
yep i knew i would not be disappointed a really great start gagged and seated for the foreseeable future

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
so after a whole bunch of monkeying around i finally got a hong kong vpn  a viu subscription and it worked beautifully until i kid you not the start of the nc scene when it started to buffer i had to turn the quality down to 240p which is hardly worth paying for  at least now if i have to sail the high seas  i wont feel guilty
so far totally worth the hassle the usual high boc production standards and bible yes bible its bible and bas im impressed how he really does appear older than bible here after looking so much younger than him in kp
ive got no words for the nc scene and honestly who needs them that was amazing and not just from an explicitness standpoint but by how well written and directed it was the dialogue felt really real to me anytime someone says how certain actors cant possibly kiss because theyre so young 18 yo fuaiz can say hold my beer and watch this
im looking forward to the plot development and cant wait to see how bible  jes work together
wat so every nc scene will be 4 minutes longest bl nc scene ever lmao


bocs cinematography
if thats the case its fucking genius

i didnt time it but it seemed to go on forever lmao


bocs cinematography
work was the slowest its been in a hot minute and it made the time drag by jesus christ but i finally got to watch after i had to restart my computer nobody wanted me to watch this show
holy fuck this was spectacular because i was looking at this thread i knew the sex scene was coming but honstly i didnt even care i was so engrossed in the story
the music was incredible and of course boc cant be beat when it comes to cinematography and color grading the shots in tongklas house were so pretty i loved the lighting i also loved the location of their underground gambling place such a cool abandoned neighborhood
speaking of that sex scene  okay basfuiaz go off not only was that sex scene hot but it was realistic the way they talked to each other during sex was so natural and real and how they both didnt come at the same time i felt like this was the most real sex scene that ive seen in a bl ever and thank you fuiaz for almost showing us bass asshole i was like you know  you could spread those cheeks a little wider
im so fucking glad to see bible acting again hes so good never over the top even when he was doing over the top stuff as vegas  it was all in pocket and natural id never seen jes act before but he was great too
my fave of the episode though den job was so cute he didnt get much time to shine in kinnporsche but he was excellent here and the glasses made him look super hot
the woman who played mandee was also really good i felt her pain and her son definitely isnt just some rando maybe her son is dead and shes also travelled back and cant handle it
i have so many questions i cant wait to start theorycrafting when we have our footing and really know more about whats happening that was one of the best parts of dff for me  figuring out what was going to happen so we heard a gunshot the first time that great had an episode when he was in his apartment elevator and he clutched his abdomen right where tyme was injured in the cold open are we in an alternate timeline did great go back more than 4 minutes since he can see him and tyme in the future past


oh my fcking god
what a spectacular beginning just amazing gooped and gagged d
fuaiz bas hot damn


its just my opinion but if the release is going to be so limited and you are going to instruct international fans not to watch it or share clips its understandable so dont promote so heavily it on a global platform like youtube or ig just promote it well in your country and let those fans enjoy it to the fullest with our blessings and good wishes
it seems counterintuitive to promote internationally and then act this way
firstkhao sandray akkayan kantbison 
5 minutes in my watch and the question that 1st arrived in my head is this is cinematography  justeverything looks so so good  i have a very particular sense of aesthetics which is why i feel japanese dramas and movies the most well shot and 4 minutes was hitting that hard i had to stop watching and simply admire the shots for a moment also why is gmmtv not shooting more shows in wider shots we all have wider screens in our tabslaptopsmobiles these days whats stopping them whys trainee is the only one

oh my gawddd


that nc scene was insanely hot they werent playing when they said it was the sultrier version they even showed their entire butts i want mooreee
great having a superpower of time traveling while having a heart attack is making me angtsy sir dont go dying on ep 6 now
even though i caved in and got the viu sub since its kinda cheap i am very much distraught that theres like a hundred different platforms for bl couldnt boc have given this to iqiyi i thought they had a good thing going already 
oh there you are
no shade but were there a lot of rewrites because i cant imagine build playing any of these characters lmao

yes sammon and someone else said that it went through a lot of rewrites and isnt much like the original at all


hold on 8episodes only
pls tell me when i should blink
i realized that they focused on tonklas expressions more than korns in this whole scene no complaints cos i am thrilled it made me feel things but what could be the reason for this


to show his incredible eye contact and eye acting cause his eyes gave us an entire dialog into what he feels and thinks
okay it was so good 
my goodness there was a brief period during that nc scene i couldnt pick my jaw off the floor actually no my mouth was wide open pretty much throughout that whole scene and believe me i tried
i cant wait to see more 
we were all wrong dyingggg lol


all this ep i was like  oh my gawd bas
also waah the story looks promisingthe production looks top notch durex and the cat food marketing was subtle it was a good start
also that nc sceneive only seen that stuff in manga i need time to process it wow and glad to see bas and job here
i love the show sammon writing is still so cooland the first scene was sus jesbible knock outwhat
i dont care if its sadhappy or open ending  i was getting bored of romcoms with polished flowery ending anyways so i needed some spice hope its dark and makes my brain worki needed a thriller bl
so far kpaction and dffhorrorthriller have not disappointed me so i have more expectations for this showplotwise also i think bas character is grey  thymegreat by jesbible is nice too 
lets see how this goes
this is so fucking good  i knew i could trust boc on delivering highquality projects  the cinematography the plot the acting everything is phenomenal 

in my villain era
met at that 33 min mark i may not survive this series but baby what a way to go 
fujin
hey did you all catch the same thing i did so greats heart stopped at the start of the episode and now hes living his life again but with the power to see 4 minutes into the future so maybe he can save tyme from being murdered am i right am i right were getting a happy ending right r i g h t 

cherry magic 
thank you for the warnings and info about the release  its good to know this context  though im sad i dont know when and where ill watch this  

omg


cause of death the heart killers 
im living vicariously through all the gifs youre posting
i can do it with a broken heart
props to you uthoughtsallday for this very detailed but comprehensive overview this is not only dedication but also a massive public service announcement and i appreciate that very much
im pissed with bocs lack of professionalism here this is rookie level noncommunication and its well it doesnt look good
im also pissed with capitalism because even when theres clearly a massive following able and willing to spend money to watch this series legally it and the greedy folks at viu prevent us from doing just that having nice things
lmao
that was cinema everything was soo good what the fuck acting cinematography nc scenes music editing one episode in and it has majorly upstaged kinnporsche this is bananas we have one for the history books on our hands also the production value is at the level of basically any high budget american show which is crazy i didnt think wed ever really get there with bl damn boc just knows how to shake things up and how to bring it nobody else in the game is doing it like them right now

bocs cinematography
im trying to purchase a premium account and do you need to have a thai cc am i going to have to jump through another hoop to get some asian prepaid

the music the colourgrading the set the fucking smut why is it so good

yeah it is to the extent that i feel i dont deserve this


hey furry thing do you know how lucky you are  in the voice of vegas telling pete in kp  do you know how sexy you are 


 do we know if this lucky kitty is bibles real life kitty

four hundred comments in 24 hours is this what the kinnporsche onairs were like that was before my time lol



its actually making me really curious as to what the viewership numbers looks like like how many people saw the first ep bc going by the number of comments its at least as many if not more but i dont know how reliable that is as an indicator

for what its worth it was pretty simple for me to sign up with a vpn  i chose the ph option i just finished watching the first episode d




 bad guy bosskateer 
im sooooooo happy with how expensive bible is in this why do i love expensive mens i cannot afford them 


his wardrobe is absofuckinglutely exquisite and tells an entire story on its own

unfortunately the direct link doesnt work unless you have the vpn active and the premium viu membership

perfect 10 liners
of course i havent watched it because its not available for interfans
also how many boc boys  have i seen now and whatever they are spending on their workshop is totally worth the money 
the premise is very interesting the patient giving her experience was very foreshadowey but it might be just there to keep us guessing i look forward to not watching the next episode wink wink


also how many boc boys  have i seen now
hmmm keep em coming we are ready im never really ready but i practice so yeah

when youre all dressed up but realize you forgot your phone at home


i loved this scene


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
holy shit that nc scene made me scream like i had never screamed what was that
that was so hot i am vibrating


i was shook to the core



yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
someone pls come collect my mouth off the floor


my mouth is going on 24hrs and refuses to get off the floor so i cant come help you right now


great thats called a hit and run tsk tsk tsk i guess she was trying to commit  glad he stopped the second time though
i usually really hate medical shows but i always find myself hooked on whatever sammon writes  manner of death triage dff and now this side note i really want transplant  the triagemanner of death sequel
korn and tonkla and their softcore porn scene  korn clearly so far in the closet hes discovered narnia  poor tonkla i feel quite bad for him the black cat after korn left was kinda creepy
sitting at the opposite end of that massive table is so petty great clearly theres something going on between him and his dad bon appetit ka to you too 
oh so korn and great are step brothers i guess same dads different mums
really intrigued by greats powers  why does he have them where did they come from whats the lesson here number 4 being a recurring theme will mean something
its weird that he saw 4 minutes ahead and ended up not seeing manee like the first time it was to avoid killing her the second tike it was to  see him and doc have sex is he reliving his past because that clearly wasnt 4 minutes in the future
im sat im invested activating chokehold also ive just missed bible on my screen and i like that hes not a raging psychopath in this role sammon always gets me with her mystery element and this feels very sammon thank god this came when it did because ive been fighting for my life to find a bl thats got me hooked since unknown my stand in was really good though and tldhlb has me pretty invested


is he reliving his past because that clearly wasnt 4 minutes in the future
i think so too the opening scenes show us jes shot and a man with long black hair getting rescusitated with a big 4 on the wall above his head
the doc conducting interviews spoke to a lady that explained the 4 minutes situation while having a heart attack and when bible got off the elevator with his incredible low cut shirt he grasped his chest like when you have a heart attack and the other person said they could see themselves when having a heart attack so i think the whole series is what bible is feeling while being rescusitated as we saw in the opening sceneshe is reviewing his life reel while under this awake asleep state

half brothers not step
yup we are watching bibles past i wrote that fan theory if you pay attention to what other patients does the last woman describes it perfectly
overall what is happening is that bible is in hospital opening scene and doctor is trying to revive him through shocksso bible is relivingthinking of his past like a normal life without realizing his current true condition and living life normally and the only abnormal thing is 4 min in future
summary we are in bibles thoughtdream world 4 min into the future is actually his past his heart aches in elevator etc are linked to real life shocks he is getting from the machine and since this is dream world time does not flow well and that black cat  if you have seen matrix is the aberration
mind eventually will have to adjust between dream world and reality

i cant be the only one who was thinking thats a white couch the entire time they were fucking on it the stains


i got past that after analyzing the couch scene extensively from the trailer i was way past that by yesterday i did the homework lol

do i need a premium subscription to watch im searching for this at the app rn and i cant find it


you from any of these countries

you do need a premium subscription even for ep1 here is the direct link in case it helps


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
i need to watch this


me myself im taking this personally boc has made it clear to me that they dont give a if we cant watch 4 minute have viki iqiy and gagaoolala why should i have to use a vpn for something they dont want me to see if you knew you wasnt going to let it be viewed internationally why show me the polit sorry for the rant


i am quite disappointed i really wanted to support this series especially for bible i have subscriptions for iqiyi viki  gagaoolala i refuse to add another subscription just for one series it pains me but i will sit this one out and watch short clips about it instead 


100 agree im too old to be figuring out how to use a vpn just to pay for it plus another premium service im out the clips were something though so im glad folks shared


i thought since the fambiz is in logistics i was thinking smuggling arms dealingoh well offshore gaming online gambling works toothats millions in minuteseldest son was keeping his shock and surprise wellso other doc is doing research on this phenomenon the 4min future time distortion might be a brain tumorsolid first ep cant wait to unraveling this mystery


my guy how could you hit her again lol take another route gorgeous
intrigued by the plot honestly very disinterested in korn aside from his relationship with great i know people dont mind the age gap with tonkla but it made me uncomfortable and i didnt really enjoy how he and tonkla spoke to each other  it added to how juvenile he is im mildly curious about how they met i guess lol
mostly interested in whatever is going on with great and i like that his love interest is a doctor i feel like that will be fun to explore

point isnt that point is that unlike the future he took responsibility after hitting her


never have i been happier that i chose to watch the premiere of a show on my tablet because boy would that have been awkward on the living room tv
as for the rest of the show im curious as to why it seems that no one has told the police that the accident was intentional it should have been cleared up a while ago and great shouldnt have to take responsibility because it wasnt his fault
im also still very much on the fence about how much i trust sugar baby


when jes the doc picked up his phone after she confessed to both docs i totally thought he was calling the detectivecops to let them know what she said but nope he was just calling to get the or prepped and i was like omg someone call the cops cause what if she dies in surgery so then i was like ok well its good that she told both docs so there were two witnesses just in case she dies since jes will be a love interest they may not belive he is telling the truth later

he he that woman is dead what we are watching is bibles dreamthoughts and a what if scenario
brain is already overworked building the world and filling the story it had to weave entire individual backstories who cares about police d
not boc saying south korea  tba and it not being available upon release i knew this was gonna happen but come on


 i know and we are all upset about their terrible communication failuressetting that aside the fact they created this masterpiece of an ep1 truly is spectacular and i am completely ok with how they chose to stream assuming the money they got in exchange was what allowed them to make this masterpiece of an episode
i just wish they would have communicated clearly and honestly what they were doing

i knew it was boc and the quality was gonna be good as always but im still shocked everytime and yes i appreciate bc no one else is doing such amazing cinematography


oh this is good  not surprised though because boc knows how to produce acting plot and cinematography all on point i will be watching every saturday with my vpn im so excited to see the rest of the series 




earthmix 
jes is so soft i feel hes going to break my heart he kind of reminds me of a grown up first i think i need to rewatch again


i am on watch 5 and it has not worn off 
he reminded me of first too which made me look forward to seeing him in more mature roles


earthmix 


as far as i know no at least not legally 

this is so unfair i have been waiting for so long


i know  me too 


fujoshi
so sorry if im just slow to the up take they werent allowing us in the united states to watch or do we have to have something special to watch on


read the post for all the details 



ugh i have major fomo but i had to work today no time for hoop jumping i am jealous and will have to try tomorrow
ok it wasnt bad vpn to thailand and go to viucom is only the first ep free


i will try going on the straight and narrow next week i have no choice  this week


earthmix 


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
ive noticed that the thing i struggle with with thai bls is the first 15 or so minutes of the first episode when characters are being introduced i always get lost and lose interest so many a bl have been dropped for this reason honestly 4 minutes was no different i struggled to follow along in this ep and had to watch the first 40 minutes or so twice to understand wtf was going on it felt like i was introduced to too many people too soon and felt overwhelmed by it all i first watched the uncut version and the nc scene was completely cut off the scenes moved from tonkla saying hes not just good at talking to korn seated at the family table and so much was lost with this cut versionand i dont mean the nc scene the post nc scene where korn leaves in a rush and tonkla sees a black cat feels like important info that the audience should have anyway watching the cut version added to my confusion but after the second watch i get whats going on and i cant wait to see what happens next
the first shirt that great has on is everything i love seeing rich male characters who dont have to wear conventional suits dress up i get lots of fashion inspo from them
lastly what time did korn start his day bc how did he get a promotion go see the business that seems to be far from his dads office go see tonkla have sex w tonkla drive to family home and have dinner with his family all before 7pm and where did he get the energy for all this



lastly what time did korn start his day bc how did he get a promotion go see the business that seems to be far from his dads office go see tonkla have sex w tonkla drive to family home and have dinner with his family all before 7pm and where did he get the energy for all this
korns day is a typical day for me minus my meditation at 4am workout at 5am etc 

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
when cut versions cut more than just the nc scenes eg cooking crush its always a disaster how long was the cut version was that the only cut you noticed
wow best bl sex scene ever we got booty cheeks nipple play and actually realistic thrusting  love that they had the lube on hand lol fuaiz is sooooooooooo hot
im really excited about this series the premise is cool the acting is good and the writing seems really good i loved bible in kp i thought he was a great actor so im really looking forward to him in this




im back at ep1 do we see a ring on doc thyme at 46sec technically the future maybe uthebookhuntress uimomen



i was watching ep 3 and thinking to myself maybe ton klas bf didnt pick up the phone last episode because he knew 2 things already
that tk brother is gone
where the bodies are buried and the reason why he had known this was because hes the one who dumped the guy there after he got him killed but after those ep 2 and 3 endings i dont know what to say about dear doctor


i didnt think this about korn when he hung up on tk the first time he answered but hung up cause he was freaking out about the emergency at the gambling den
however when he saw all the missed calls i wondered and these thoughts crossed my mind but also he was dealing with a lot of chaos in his new important job and tk is not his boyfriend so he is not his priority he is his sugar baby and his well being is not his main concen and he wont make time for him he has a new important job and his fiancegirlfriend is his priority given her dad is the one getting him out of the pickle he got himself into
but you have very valid points and maybe you are completely right

my heart is overflowing with happiness and excitement  i finally get to watch one of my most anticipated shows without jumping through hoops i literally watched ep 1 and stopped because i couldnt bear all the nonsense surrounding streaming availability it really made it hard for me to enjoy the series
watching on a big screen makes a world of difference i was never ready for a close up of korns sexy bum and the way tonkla was semi parting it  firm  start to the series i loved ep 1 now onwards to ep 2 comment image


woohoo welcome

i can do it with a broken heart
so first thoughts on episode 1 yall can laugh at me great and korn are brothers yes great is the good poor little rich kid yeah korn is slowly being jaded by his familys secret dirty business everyone has secrets duh tonkla has some hes keeping from korn too tyme has little empathy for anyone let alone his patients hell probably learn that from great he clearly doesnt like working for the public hospital system  where his talents are possibly needed i thought the suicidal woman could be tonklas mother but probably not

i can do it with a broken heart
ahahahaha the dinner hes so over his family lol
i just love how everyone is always making a distinction between drugs alcohol and nicotine boy do i have news for you
tyme is so jaded he hates being poor eh
so my theory is great actually got into that accident when he hit that woman and he was hurt badly and all we see is an alternate reality ie what would have happened had he been able to see 4 minutes ahead im guessing the moral of the stories ultimately is about choices the ones we make and the ones we dont make and all the main characters are dead or near dead

it is just enraging i like many others im sure have been waiting and dying to see 4 minutes and of course its the oe straming site that isnt available i even left tweet on be on cloud twitter page honestly i wasnt expwcting them to answer its just frustrating

how can boc make something as great and exceptional as kinnporsche and then put their two heartthrobs in something as dull as man suang even jeff satur and barcode left the studio and they are two up and comers why would boc limit its audience on their latest release


where can i find this


hey which country do i need to chose to watch the uncut version i am having a hard time


soooooo at just after 3433 did any one else him ask is in it or out during the nc scene


just finished watching 4 minute sultrier version through vpn and i have no wordsgaggedi mean daddy chill

christ i was not ready for that
cinematography is amazing story line very compelling and the nc
what to say one of the most realistic looking i have ever seen even with the throwing away of the bottle of lube
fuaiz is completely blowing me away the way he uses his eyes no wonder the camera is focusing on his face
and me feeling especially old and creepy he turned 18 last january
bas is also killing it not only in the nc scene the thrusts
but also when he walks in that office and the relationship with his half brother
jes and bible they are great
8 episodes in total
that is not what im used too but with this high quality i dont complain


the nc scene is crazy but i just wanna know if fuaiz was at a legal age



so i feel really dumb i got vpn and was able to watch the 1st episode sultry edition no issues but now i cant watch the 2nd episode on vpn viu says content not available
for reference the vpn is express vpn and im connecting to hk both 1 and 2 with no luck
any help would be appreciated
edit apparently hk no longer works for sultrydirectors cut how i watched episode 1 on vpn viu wont load with thialand so i ended up trying the phillipines and that works hopefully this wont be a round robin guessing game each week for the episodes

lol this might be the first time i will willingly watch a censored version
in my head nc scenes like this fit more to a trashy series but 4 minutes seems to really put emphasis on the story and shots and overall cinematography to the extent that the nc scene is just taking me out of the story xd
so far really nice start


what okwell yes i guess it may not be for everyone
