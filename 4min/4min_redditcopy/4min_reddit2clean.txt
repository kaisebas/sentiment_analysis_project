this is so cute im screaming boc really knows how to balance insane plotdrama and cute romantical stuff like this so so well 


bocs cinematography
he was immediately like omg hot guy hot guy hot guy hot guy

i thought he was leaving but no he just wanted to get himself together for boyfie



please so many people on twitter are like omg tyme is a traitor and im like hes checking his hair and flexing in the mirror hes not just after info  i loved it so much especially when hed go from suave and hitting on great to obviously inwardly facepalming at himself


i may sound stupid but what info does tyme need from great have i missed something

what imomen said  basically it implies that tyme has ulterior motives for approaching great we saw him pause when he saw the card on the flowers which possibly means that he recognized his name but just because he has another motive doesnt mean that he cant also be motivated by finding great hotadorable af
at the end of todays episode its revealed that tyme is up to something with the curly haired woman that works at korns online gambling outfit we see her walk up and gave tyme a flash drive b4 it goes off 


damn that was tyme i have poor eyesight  i was excited to get a new hottie but

i love this nurse

when tyme is about to examine him i noticed that he says ummm in english then goes to thai

that whole scene was so fun and hilarious and was giving me manhwa vibes so bad like a lot of bls try to capture the manhwa vibes that japanese bl specifically does so well but few thai bl can do it as well as boc lol
yeah i noticed that too lol

screaming


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
the way he got in between those legs so nonchalantly
doc realising he was being too transparent too early 


reel it in doc too obvious you are not a good actor buddy you are a surgeon he is gonna figure out you are sus also as a surgeon maybe punching faces and damaging your hands is not advisable

types olive oil stained broken hip
im glad he used his hands though that dude deserved it


yes dont mess up bibles immaculate face dude
still screaming


this part killed me like where are your eyes going sir


i screamed very loudly here

theyve barely met and i can tell wins already seduced lol


bocs cinematography
theres no more romantic place than the morgue while he prettily cries over the corpse of his brother
look they dont have to put my love life on blast like this


funeral hookups are a thing its how some guys confront their own mortality and sad boners

literally happened in the pornographer mood indigo  that was a wild scene

so thats why jj had the pornstache to look like an older cop guy i still want to shave it off though 

yeah its not a good look and makes him look like hes trying way too hard to look older on purpose lol 

im so confused
but doc hottie stepping between greats legs to examine him like that er was oozing from the sexual tension lol
the inspector stache and tonkla ship is starting its journey and im on board 

that er was oozing from the sexual tension lol
oozing what tho 

lol you choose imma say gay pheromones


but doc hottie stepping between greats legs to examine him like that er was oozing from the sexual tension lol
this was my ep 2 highlight

title rolling up to great like can you help me hide a bodyyyy  like its a casual friday evening
this is so good so far its definitely going to be a series i rewatch to analyze all the juicy bits


title rolling up to great like can you help me hide a bodyyyy  like its a casual friday evening
i said outloud oh i am definitely not a ride or diei may help but explain the situation first 

bas you better werq bitch 


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
well i guess thats what i missed in the cut version

same but looking at it i cant shake the feeling the actress had a good laugh i always remember emilia clarke talking about scenes with jason it was big pink and fluffy xd he wore a cute sock apparently



i was not expecting to see a cfnm scene that is a very niche kink
are they related or did korn just call her dad uncle out of respect it would be super weird if they are actual cousins by blood

hot 

jes is both cute and handsome dashing but in an understated way
wait so whos dead


bocs cinematography
mannn this is going to be dff all over again where we can go back and watch the episodes after we have more knowledge and see all the clues in hindsight

sammon stays saying bitch you thought to us 
dr flex 


he is such a cute undercover wannabe falling for his victim lol


with his serious face it took a full minute before i realised what he was trying to do 

hot cop jjay omg


his heart eyes later did me in 

and it was so immediate i was hollering lol

also why do i have a feeling that the son of the lady in the hospital who commited sicide is smh important for the story and will appear at some point she mentioned him so many times to the doc and great was he working at the gambling business to pay off his debt 
i got my cherry pepsi slushy and a bucket of chips its almost 9am here im ready 2 go


how do i get that chair

temu but results may vary


now im super curious about what generic nat chen would look like 

there you are white  i meant tonkla


he is so freaking pretty 


quick psa last week i watched by accident the not so sultry version and then watched again the sultrier version after i figured out i had the wrong vpn anyways the sultrier version also has other scenes not nc that are cut from the other version for instance there was a scene where great and korn talk after the dinner at their parents that was cut from the shorter version i found that overall the sultrier version gave more context to the story and of course the great nc scene

thank you for the warning thats really good to know


yes as mentioned on the post there are different versions of the series in each country not just ncs are removed  viu mentioned this in their post


bocs cinematography
jet playing a character who isnt a total shithead challenge failed id love to see him being someone nice sometime his face is so expressive and interesting to look at that id love to watch him and not want to chuck boiling water in it i was hoping wed get some jetmio action guess not
i was scared there for a second that we were going to get a hetero sex scene hetero gross but fasai is really pretty that thigh shot though
so korn probably knew about the gambling all along and was lying
them not showing tongklas brothers face interesting my theory is that we saw tongkla in the future in the cold opening i think that he was killing who killed his brother in the place where it happened also the fact that it deliberately didnt show us his brothers face is that his brother is maybe tyme or den or someone that weve seen already i think he was killing korn or he was killing his brother and all of this is an act
tyme being all flustered about seeing great again was adorable checking his muscles and tucking his shirt in and seeing bible all nervous when tyme slotted himself between greats legs to check his wound was cute since bible has such a cool aura
tyme and win being instant simps on the job loser icons
so why is a doctor interested in closing illegal gambling dens are the timelines all out of order
poor tongkla you could tell he was just carved out i hope its not all an act and hes just a liar who murdered his brother but the fact that korn just completely forgot about him in his time of need  i mean i get that you were busy because you fucked up your illegal gambling house but you dont have to be an asshole about it  and he just lost his brother and knows that no justice will come of it thats a person who will do anything because they have nothing left to lose
vip this episode is anne i love how shes just trying to blow up tymes rizz him yanking greats chart away from her was hilarious

are the timelines all out of order
thats how it feels like atm like were only getting bits and pieces and it all will come together at the end low key loving that concept but also hating it cause im constantly confused lol


i think the opening scenes are in the future
the thing that keeps frustrating me is that i keep trying to figure out the disconnects and then going wait no because i remember something that connects it the only thing i feel like could be possible is that korn and tonklas timeline is before everything that happens with great


bocs cinematography
see i thought it was after i imagine by episode 8 our brains will be exploding just like with dff

fujin
from that woman who had a heart attack in the first episode i think were dealing with two different timelines in the first one great almost dies and cant save tyme who started investigating all the gambling stuff maybe because of the suicidal womans son  i dont know in the second one great gets the power to see the future to fix everything he did wrong and repeats because his heart stopped and you get that kind of power  i dont know like if you reach your thirties and youre still a virgin you get to read peoples minds lol
i want to know how much delusion im working with here but this is my take

great theories though tyme is interested only because he knows he is a brother and part of the mafia family he made sure to mention he knew his name
tongkla being the actual killer is possible i havent thought about it

woahyou just called hetero nc scene grossso unoriginali wouldnt like to see a hetero one eitherbut i wont say its gross 


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
way more questions than answers for me from this one i had to watch the cut version which is 3 minutes shorter than the sultrier version so i dont know what i missed
im not sure who died tonklas dead brother was referred to as nongchai or younger brother dome doesnt look like hed be younger title either but he sure is a dick isnt he just like top in dff
im loving tyme so far kind of cold on the outside but soft and sensitive on the inside jes is very impressive and he gets hotter to my eyes with every scene
baskorn looks a lot like milekinn same hair same styling i dont imagine thats 100 coincidence
i hope we get an akuma cameo every episode
bible continues to slay that is all
off to watch it again
arghhhhh not again with these previews


i could watch those all day every day keep throwing them in every episode please

and thats ton in the beginning so what he had beef w title and saw him lying there and finished the job 


bocs cinematography
i think this might be in the future there is more blood on that rock than in the beginning i think he might be killing his brothers killer or maybe he killed his brother and is lying

ahh yes good point this show is really fking w mee 


i think the beginning scenes are in the future but they tie them in so good they showed us tonkla smoking exactly like this later in the episode to tie him back to this person we are not supposed be able to recognize but like fuaizs eyes gave him away immediately i gotta go back and watch but do we know for sure he is killing title
i mean the police investigation definitely could tie title to tonklaa bro death due to circumstantial evidence since they were there together but what if they are throwing us off cause that rage could be directed at korn rage like that often happens when love goes wrong and you find out he had something to do with your brothers death


bocs cinematography
crazy theory time
so the stuff with tongklakornwin is all in the future and not the same timeline that were seeing with great so for some reason that will be revealed later jes is trying to close down korns gambling den maybe because he is tongklas brother and knows about his involvement with korn tyme was the person in the body bag and tongkla kills korn in retribution so great has to come back to change this past so tyme doesnt die
this will get holes poked in it in an instant but im just throwing it out there
edit or tyme is using great as an in to take down this company tyme falls in love with great but gets killed for it  tongkla kills korn


the only thing is im pretty sure tongkla calls his brother nong not phi when hes crying over him so if thyme did die hed have to be the younger brother which im not sure i buy lol

yes i was thinking the samethe brother that died must be someone we already saw i was thinking tyme as wellaand that connects with the first scene of the first episode when tyme was being shoot at it was him right
maybe they are brothers that dont live together and are doing this ton with korn and now tyme with great  to avenge their parents or something maybe they worked at the gambling farm and got killed for it or something  nobody can know tyme and ton are brotherthus the disconnect btw the houses tyme does seem very insistent in pursing great it looks cute but it has more to it
what do we know for sure it cant be korn nor great
if it is in the futureit could be anyone else but tyme makes sense could be too close to dff though i havent watched it all but i know the reveal at the end was connected to brothers
i dont like thisthe show is so well made but its going to be one of those too close to reality give me the same quality but with some fluff and just a bit of conflict to make it interestingi have a feeling everyone is dead already or going to


bocs cinematography
fun fact before the episode starts  people who have had near death experiences and diedcame back often report that they have issues wearing watches or with technology because the electromagnetism in their body is all wiggidy schwiggidy the scientific term of course
cutie mio finally 


perfect 10 liners
jes is so hot and after seeing countless vegas edits over the years its still a bit weird seeing shy bible but hes so cute all flustered and shy
and are the officer and the twink endgame because i would be ok with that


shy bible is everything i didnt know i needed

what the fuck happened at this ep too much have been going on hahahaha
and the tension between tyme and great 
girl 

im fuckin tripping everytime jes is talking i can hear first from gmmtv im crazy they have the same tone of voice
doc basically throwing himself at great lol
for a moment i thought title was dead the little bitch is still alive
who is tonklas brother wait did tonkla killed his brother cause the intro was him rocking someone to deathh
korn u bitch
so we are gettin jjayfuaiz after all
ok so doc is behing the hackin


earthmix 


that was me i was like wait title is tons brother and he killed his brother and now pretending to mourn him but then he appeared at greats

i dont even know where to begin that was a bit of a mindfuck of an ep even though there wasnt any actual fucking donekinda lame imo
it was confusing they jampacked so many things all i know is these so called professionals the cop and the doctor acting really sus and horny nurse you better clock him might just be a green case but flexing while patients literally bleeding comment image

earthmix 
i cant be the only one who tried scanning his line id 

vpn loading in 321

i love the mystery i love it when the show doesnt hold your hand but lets you figure out things throughout the show i just hope it will make sense at the end 
i dont even care if its a bl show still would watch it as a straight one
i am soooo intrigued by the timeline here and whats going on because we know that were seeing things out of order its just a matter of piecing it all together
thoughts
something i loved about this episode is the way that they put in fluff and comedy it can be difficult to do that with a show thats focused on action and intrigue but they managed here and it is top tier also can we pause for a moment to reflect on the fact that it seems like great is seeing himself have sex with tyme before it happens like of course the boy is having gay panic and then im wondering if hes had sex before or not and whether hes been with a man before or not
i have a lot of sympathy for korn in this episode he had this job dropped on him and didnt want him but he obviously wants to do well at it and to make his father happy it doesnt surprise me that hes feeling stress over it and is getting tense especially when he makes a monumental screwup our sympathies are with tonkla because we know whats going on with him but korn doesnt also damn that scene with fasai was everything and ive now seen more of bas butt in the last two weeks than i have in the last two years lmao
i saw someone else say that they were hoping for jetmio but i am actually so relieved that didnt happen we have enough going on without adding in another couple title is a grade a asshole and has me questioning how and why great came to be friends with him tbh
i am so curious about the connections here we have the woman in the hospital who lost her son and we know something happened to korns mother we know that something happened to tonklas brother but we dont know who is brother is for sure yet and we know that tyme gets shot and that tonkla kills someone but we dont know what goes down there weve been told that things in the show are happening out of order and that people may not know what time theyre in etc so my brain is going about fifty miles a minute trying to figure all of this out lol about the only thing that seems to be linear so far is great hitting the woman  taking her flowers  seeing tyme  then seeing him later but we also showed a snippet last week that seemed to be of the woman still dying so whats happening here i feel like i need to go back and rewatch to get a better idea of what the possible timeline could be but it could also be that we just dont have enough info yet
it feels like tonklas storyline is definitely happening at a different time but the question is  when is it possible that it happened earlier the woman mentioned her son being greats age so i feel like that means that its either title dome or tonkla with i guess title or dome being more likely since tonkla has a brother 


the woman mentioned her son being greats age so i feel like that means that its either title dome or tonkla with i guess title or dome being more likely since tonkla has a brother 
cant be title cause title has money and an influential father
she said her son tried to make money but lost all of it what if her son was a gambler or part of the gambling business

omg its only the second episode but i can already tell these series are gonna be one of my most favorite  literally everything is so great its feels like watching a high quality western movies
and can we appreciate jess acting i knew he was an actor in the industry for a long time but this is my first time watching him on screen his portrayal of all the tiniest emotions is just so spot on  and his and bibles chemistry is definitely chemistrying 


hopefully we got another nc scene to this week


lol yall still havent figured out boc logic they do not do a lot of nc they do 12 nc make it so good and thats it now focus on the plot they say 

well that would be ideal but boc typically spreads them out and doesnt usually do one in every episode but lets hope thats changed here 

bocs cinematography
and hopefully its also 4 minutes long again
right now my main theory and im always wrong is great is creating alternate timelines and in one of them dome dies and were seeing the result of the timeline where great doesnt change anything
so my theory is dome is tongklas brother but again im always wrong lol

captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
is that fuaiz at the beginning of the episode with the rock
with every scene jes appears in i find him more and more attractive i thought bible would be the one id have my eyes on but jes quiet charm has me hooked
tyme falling for great and trying to act cool while anne side eyes him was the best thing that happened in this episode
every day i am so grateful i decided to get a vpn subscription

 already because every time i was like oh ok thats whats going onnope never mind lol i for one love a good plot heavy series and even if i dont get it nowand i mean these timelines what i love all the little twists
poor tonkla hes going through it but like i also knew my boy wasnt that innocent didnt expect a full on murder though and korn honey get it together like it did not take long at for him to screw things up so much for tons little pep talk  pep sex combo 
nurse anne clock him sis tyme trying to act like he didnt care was cute im sure he has ulterior motives but i mean its bible he said might as well get me a good time to
i also just need great to keep better company because sir who is talking about i know something fun we can do murder  his initial reaction was not big enough for me it would have been an immediate nope as soon as he said he had his girl locked up police


i also just need great to keep better company because sir who is talking about i know something fun we can do murder  his initial reaction was not big enough for me it would have been an immediate nope as soon as he said he had his girl locked up police
this when he mentioned the locked up girl i was like what do you mean oh ok

im so confused but im sure by the end i will understand all of it lol


yeah i dare not say this but it makes no sense to me im just here to see jes and bible


i ran away from work to watch this the acting writing duh directing and cinematography are all very well done thats all i came to say gbye




i am so confused but i love it sm
like i know that tonkla is def the person at the beginning was it him that killed his brother and lied about it cuz if not he killed his brothers killer it would be damn weird for the police to let that same rock remain at that place after a freaking person already died because of it so either tonkla is a mastermind liar and actor lets go bitcvh or this is a wonky time episode with time travelingleaps and shi i hated inception so istg
and for the brother himself maybe tonklas brother is the accident ladys son cuz tonkla was like why did it have to be you cuz maybe both of them were struggling for money but his little brother was struggling more this one im kinda not sure about cuz a lot of things wouldnt add up
another theory about the brother cuz bro is making me mad like who r u man is that maybe the person who dome was talking to near the lockers seemed kinda romantic was tonklas younger brother and bc he promised to meet up tonklas brother went looking for dome and thats why he ended up at that place where something happened if this were to be true im gonna assume that he didnt get oomphed by the rock and it was same place but different timing and circumstances the rock that win found was from titles whole tantrum thing not tonklas brothers thing
but honestly whats most likely gonna happen is that they will reveal these things to be a couplefew different timelines this is mainly because 1 this whole series is about time 2 the place with the light tower thingie came up like 3 times this probably means that a bunch of things happened there but different ways i would bet that greats power allows him to also jump to different timelines not just see 4 minutes into the future
okay so last thing im actually so happy that fuaiz is getting a bigger role and i hope he has a lot to do with the plot also bro be pulling like crazyyyy i gotta get in line fr


so korn is everybodys bitch and we get to see his gorgeous behind againdr tyme so cute trying to lowkey flirt with greatdoc up your game i think it just went over greats headfuaiz is crying againdont worry too much inspector stache jjay is doing a house call at nightso definitely lady nest hair at the offsite gambling is a spyeverything ties up with the gamblingthere are those who want to shut it down and there are those out for revenge for lives destroyed and lostinteresting to see how will great navigate this with his 4minute superpower



writing this before reading any other comments so i may be completely wrong only watched it once
this is sooooo freaking good
ok dying to see the photo tonkla was holding of his brother  who is his bro i dont think he is the shareholder that fahs dad had killed off the guy with the unbrella in theflashback cause if tonklas bro was rich enough to be a shareholder tonkla wouldnt need korns money
so guessing tonklas bro maybe was the hacker but at the end maybe the girl from the gambling place with the usb drive was the hacker
did she really give the usb to doc tyme at the end  i have no idea i didnt have time to rewind or record or rewatch ugh it looked like him though and he was dressed all in black and he obviously seemed to know great at the hospital and great had the hot af  flashbacks or flashforwards so it seems like doc tyme definitely knows great from before and not just from the papers flying
unless the doc and the police officers are just falling in lust immediately and instantly with great and tonkla respectively  when doc tyme was moving inbetween greats legs to stitch him up their chemistry was suffocating me omfggggg 
title is a dick with a well connected dad since he offered great his dads help if anything went wrong with the lady great hit with his car last week
titles location for the murder plot maybe coincidentally is the same place where fahs dad had the shareholder andor the hacker murdered maybe its the go to place to make someone disappear my city has a place like that so its possible it is just a coincidence and ofcourse the rock will tie the two crimes together and probably get great into trouble
the way doc tyme was randomly in that car elevator parking and aggressively tried to get greats line id is sus  unless we consider greatbible is fine af and i could totally believe doc was just hot for him  but if we are analyzing plot doc tyme has an anterior motive probably
bas completely nude another week in a row and i am not mad the slurping  sound though when he was eating fah out though was not as hot as when he moaned with tonkla last week ngl 
tonkla last week was definitely stressed out and hiding something from korn when korn arrived last week was it just the drugs empty baggie from today or was tonkla in cahoots with his bro to screw over korn
or is tonklas bros death unrelated and just there to throw us off like title and view tried to throw us off 
update
after thinking more about todays episode here is my current theory on great


bocs cinematography
one thing about tongkla last week too is i noticed that he very deliberately unbuttoned his shirt more while korn wasnt looking he might be playing him

i dont think tonkla was hiding anything shady from korn he was just hiding his cigarette box and lighter bcs korn hates smoking as established last week

ok i went back to try to figure this out and its a hot mess in my mind so dff was exhausting i dont like exhausting


im exhausted my brain is exhausted but also i want to rewatch ep1 for a 5th time and ep2 for a 2nd time tomorrow 

why did pkorn do that i loved him he cheated  i cant express how i feel rn


sadly we knew this from ep1 korn is cheating on that girl fah with tonkla when he spoke with his dad from tonklas place before they finished round 2 he told his dad he was with fah his girlfriendfiance tonkla is just korns sugar baby

this series is already gonna be iconic omg the twists they keep pulling i never know wtf to expect next
the camera shots cinematography the editing music sound editing everything is  immaculate
i was shocked from the first second of this ep onward expectations are irrelevant bc you cant predict anything
i knew fuaizs character was going to meet jjs but holy fck the way they met and we still didnt see who his brother was i knew korn was just using him as like a sugar baby situation but wow we got bas booty again 
jes is gorgeous and so hot in the all black outfit like boi i saw you primping in the mirror bro dont even lie you were tryna hit  like no gimme the chart  ill stitch it up myself 
im digging jes  bible so far
i cant believe great was friends with title like he is a rich scumbag i wonder who his father is i thought maybe the uncle but idk
the plot threads and threading 


i already really enjoyed episode 1 but episode 2 was so much fun and brought so much confusion bible and jes chemistry is top notch the looks especially jes has me blushing so curious what is happening and where things will go


bible and jes chemistry is top notch
it is palpable


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
bro greats friend is super dangerous




fck
this series omg holy sht my head is a mess i wonder who tonkla brother was i thought it was title but then he appeared again like wtf omg
and now also tonkla please make korn a cuckold please i command you sir the bastard deserves it
do it with mr hot policeman win please i want it haha d

wait so i had no trouble accessing the full subbed version of ep 1 last week w my vpn but now i an only get the first 3 minutes wout subs of ep 2 is ep 1 free for anyone but after that you have to have a viu subscription or are the eps getting released later for nonsubscribers

i live in those countries where the series is available on viu but yeah i got cut off too after the first 3 minutes and it says i have to subscribe i wonder how those in europe and the us will be able to watch the full episode

you have to subscribe to watch only ep1 was available for free per vius announcement
babieeee that 41 annual subscription is worth every penny


for vpn users what country are you using i uaed hk last week and it was fine now its not working at all weirdly enough i tried sg but it asked me to upgrade to premium but im already a premium user


i have the same issue used hk vpn last week and it was all good this week they only have the cut version and my subscription doesnt work on thai viu 

bocs cinematography
i use thailand


im using thailand

earthmix 

did not read the spoilers but i forgot episode two is out today im currently watching two worlds though 

what country are people using to get the uncensored episodes


so hk had the uncensored for ep1 but people are reporting that ep2 in hk is censored people are also saying that singapore has censored so no nc and also some scenes are removed even if not nc
most are able to access both versions cut and uncut through thailand and philippines so far

am i the only one who is scared we wont be having a happy ending i fear not all of our favs are making out alive


i came into this knowing there absolutely will not be a happy ending unfortunately 

after dff im just assuming everyone is dying lol i mean to me dff had an open ending but by no means was it happy


im really liking how the actor plays tyme the comedic timing is so cute and funny to me kinda realistic even haha i first wanted to see more vegas characteristics but getting into great bible is doing well just wished his character wasnt a student tonklas character is interesting then idc about the other side characters lol


tyme cand also see in the future like great


as far as we know no but tyme seems to have ulterior motives for getting close to great so he is trying to get greats phone number as part of his plan with the gambling site


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
just gimme a second im gonna watch this im so excited


okay so episode 2
poor great is having an absolute time of it hes going to need therapy after all of this shit
what does dr thyme want from great he seems way too invested this early
oh so korn decided to strip and go down on fasai then whilst also ignoring his boyfriend whos unidentified brother was just found dead in the very same place korns own brother was the night before with his friend title who might actually he a psychopath i dont think i like korn anymore
i get this feeling that all of these seemingly individual stories are going to link up at some point like a jigsaw puzzle and well all collectively be like omg that makes so much sense now unidentified brother korn living 2 different lives dr thymes motives the woman who tried to commit whos still getting scenes  backstory of her son who committed so clearly she andor he is important title being a psycho and of course great and why tf hes seeing 4 minutes ahead  so many storylines to follow
already love the biblexjes chemistry i reckon it will grow more as the show progresses just hope its not a tragic ending


just for clarity as we found out last week korn was cheating on this woman who is his girlfriendfiance with tonkla his sugar baby last week


queen sammon the plot is interesting
i think dr thyme was the one that hired hacker and also saved great either he can look into the future or is investigating greats fam for revenge i dont know
so korn is a two timing prick has rich fianc connections i think his character is eye catching cant wait for more also bas naked scene lmaoi saw his butt for 2 eps lol
dome is the nice guyi almost shipped titledome lol
title is a violent person with murder tendencies i think hell harm great again
so its official jjfaiz is back in this series i guessi guess kongkla will cheat on korn vice versa and unites with his police lover also the first scene did kongkla kill someone did he kill his brother with rock or acting innocent i need to rewatch this scene im a little confused so kongkla is not so innocent huh he smoked and killed his bro
thymegreat are growing on me thyme is a complex character i cant understand his intentions im loving this show boc never fails to awe me with a good bl thriller

i think this series is going to be too gloomy and jarring for me
ive noticed that as soon as a character acquires super powers death and destruction follow them everywhere great seems to be strangely disconnected from life and this new power of his is forcing him to step forward


gloomy
this is the brand of this series it most definitely is not a happy situation



im really enjoying it this bl has so much potential  boc youve done it again 


i havent watched epsiode 2 yet cause its too good

mind if i ask did they show the full sex scene of jesbible in the uncensored version of ep 2 during one of bibles futuresights

and is the uncensored version of ep 2 only 47 minutes long or did i just watched the censored one

they didnt show the full one but a lot of parts from the main one that we should be getting in ep4

i still dont get tle is still alive who tf died in that lighthouse area




help with what wow whats wrong with title no friendship is worth jail time


right
i can do it with a broken heart
thoughts about episode 2
title is the bad bad friend with bad influence who uses great for clout and protection because his family is either linked or more powerful he also probably killed view and did something to dome
ahahaha fuuuuuuuuuuck

i can do it with a broken heart
muhahahah tyme is so whipped for great who might accidentally have killed is trigger happy friend title
ahahaha i repeat my fuuuuck from earlier so tonkla and title are brothers well shit
huh so mor tyme was there to break up with his gf right but why was title there so somebody else coincidentally died on the same spot whaaat lol im so confused
the curly haired woman in the casino is either a mole a reporter or an undercover cop right
eeeh hows mor tyme involved in the casino business wtf

title actually has the connections and offers help to great over the car accident situation

wait thats dr jes right


it is so refreshing to watch actors that know how to act all of these guys are acting downnn like fuaiz is just 18 my goodness shoutout to boc

fujin
they made me love and hate korn so quickly that im a mess this show is absolute fire yall im still frustrated that something with so much potential is only being shown in a few countries bible jes and the rest of the cast deserve so much more and this could have been something praised outside bl productions

i completely agree with you


this show is too good its so painful waiting for every new episode

not so related but to me the actor fuaiz thanawat looks like this another actor named tai thanaphat not part of 4 minutes does anyone see the similarities between these two or am i tripping


one thing i really do enjoy in this show is that it seems like greats default language is not thai which is like bible and its fun lol


i am so angry with korn  tonkla deserves sooo much better he needs to get with the cop immediately


has anyone in canada figured out how to subscribe to viu premium i can vpn to viucom just fine but the site wont accept my canadian bank credit card for payment
do they hate money seriously its baffling


the way after finishing this ep i have more questions than before lmaooo i love this show


i guess boc doesnt care about the us global fans oh well there are plenty of other bls to watch that do care about the global fans  


context

guys i tried to post a pic of bass ass but it was deleted
i am too stressed out to watch out of context incoherent bls
theres no sex in this ep i might lose interest


i mean its sammonboc theyre more plot focused if you just want the nc scenes then you could probably just wait for spoilers and watch based on that because we probably wont get a ton like even kp only had 4 and that was spread out across 12 episodes and dff had 3 iirc


im just here for bible and the doc hopefully they both live but if not just would like to see the full nc scene p i figure someone will put up a nice diagram once we get there to explain it all just like the horror one i never understood 

types olive oil stained broken hip
post it in chati need a good reminder

two things for one of which im going to be crucified
my friend and i used to classify good looking men into three types knitting pattern shaving advert and gay porn jes and bible have completed their journey to arrive at the pinnacle of hotness
at the risk of getting slaughtered so far guys i dont think the show is very good great production values yes but its all confusing as hell and the writing is just awful ill still visit from time to time for the hot men but a masterclass in storytelling it aint maybe things will change
im going back to bed now bye


why do you think the writing is awful i dont think you gave enough detail lol like yes its confusing but its also meant to be at this stage of the game


how is it awful the multiple timelines are being connected flawlessly they are providing clues every step of the way
but yes it may require analyzing and rewatching and that kind of active watching i do understand is not for everyone
