when he was lying on the bed heart racing unable to calm down and smiling so much i was just like

tymes pace gradually speeding up is so fucking peak i cannot no slomo sultry scenes here


bocs cinematography
spread tattooed thighs are so hot


 glistening skin

from this messy hair point till they finished its exactly 4minutes


thank you for clocking that i watched twice and failed to clock anything 


i dont think i blinked in this episode let alone look at a clock 
win is such a fatal attraction mess hes acting like the wife being cheated on 


bocs cinematography
win is a mess

i keep forgetting his characters name and just call him confused cop jj
gag

we love a sassy power bottom in this household
boi knows what he wants and how he needs to be treated fr
kick korns ass to the curb sis

ton should keep them both tbh win for the raw sex and obsessive nature and korn for the  and more sex lol


for clarification for those asking if ton kla finally got his wish up me means cum inside me and our cop delivered just that 

dead dead absolutely dead omg dead

when win dropped his bags i screamed lol honestly this is what i dont understand about bl the whole no no we cant possibly bit where guy 1 is forward and ready to go and guy 2 is always saying no and looking disinterested the way win is always down to fuck when prompted is probably the most realistic portrayal of mm relationship dynamics ive seen in a bl so far
boc stays dragging the gworls


not just mm many people are down to fuck at any time so like i do not comprehend this either but yes i love cop being completely ready to go immediately without hesitation
omg my standin flashbackkkkk lol
helllllllp

the straddling  lifting up part always gets me exquisite 
in that clip i am going to assume tonkla finally got his goal raw power there cause i didnt see the product placement


bocs cinematography
i recently read a book called recursion by blake crouch i highly recommend it and him as an author his books are great  especially dark matter and its premise was that there was a thing called a memory chair that had initially been created to help people with alzheimers but you could use it to go back to a specific memory and relive your life starting from that point however you and the people around you who were affected by the memory change would get false memories once the timelines converged in the future and they would remember the dead timeline and it didnt end up great usually
it made me wonder if we are seeing dead timelines here moving together the picture of tongkla and his brother when they were kids sure looked like dome i think we are seeing two timelines overlapping with each other and great is the recursionconvergence so when we see tongkla we are seeing a timeline where dome wasnt saved mod is the friend that win tried to question who we of course also see with great maybe tongkla killed title as revenge but maybe he killed someone else korn or great since this case is obviously metastasizing titles dad is a big deal  is the police chief titles dad and thats why hes trying to cover up the murder its just a working theory and obviously not all fleshed out and i could be way off base but just putting it out there
i know people arent here for plot theories today and are here for the porn but why not both

im always here for the porn with plot so that is one interesting theory thanks and chapeau 

this theory seems very plausible
multitasking between plot and soft pretty pornwannabe is what boc is so good at
the kissingggggg  so wait theyre gonna have another sexy time scene right because in greats visions hes riding someone tyme lol 


bocs cinematography
this was my fave shot of the whole episode out of all the shots in all the sex scenes this felt the most mutual and equal they werent having sex here they were lovemaking


im really starting to think that tonkla is the real main character of 4 minutes d

and he keeps showing us why he could be
my good sis did not put his pants back on i am screaminggggg


bocs cinematography
he just looks like a heartbroken little boy here he is so pathetically in love


hes so down bad hes crying at the gym at the club at the police station everywhere
this boi he barely knows has him gagged fr


bocs cinematography
tongkla got that magic asshole
i just keep smh and laughing everytime he looks so forlorn because of bb ton ton is truly gong to ruin his life lol

i was laughing the whole scene lakjdflkfj
im saying why didnt he put his pants on 

i cant believe we saw actual 

i have never seen  or  and this has both

i was screaming so fking high like please you had plenty of time to put the goddman pants on
hot
help

so this was rather sweet  unexpectedly
i guess it supposed to show the contrast between greats innocent sweet love development and whatever is going on in tonklas messed up world 


right a little brighter literally and it would look like its a scene from a different show it was a nice break from all the angst and desperation and whatever in tonklas lifehomescenes
help


i am waiting for your contribution with the brightened scenes 
wins dying while tons having the time of his life screaming


bocs cinematography
i absolutely love this dynamic of the simp top compared to the power bottom we get it so rarely in bls because of their heteronormative dynamic

this series is doing a spectacular job of telling stories through intimate scenes imho i feel like 90 of the scenes weve seen tongkla in were somehow related to sex and yet he also feels like the character i know best and feel most connected to its not just sex all those scenes tell us so much about who he is as a person and i love that
that flashback to his first time with korn i was honestly shook its such an emotionally complicated scene korn definitely holds the power there and it certainly feels a little weird only time will tell what kind of person korn really is part of me at the same time cant help feeling sorry for korn never being able to be himself around his family for not being able to make true on his promise meanwhile tongkla is just so vulnerable and open i honestly got goosebumps
and now with win he seems to repeat the sexual patterns korn taught him i guess this is just how he has learned to show and receive love except this time tongkla is very much the one holding the reins for the first time hes in a relationship inasfar as we can call it that where hes not dependent and hes enjoying having power over someone for once while at the same time filling whatever hole is left in his soul hes really a very lonely character
like most people i am also definitely wondering whether he is the murderer though especially after that opening scene
tldr i am absolutely fascinated by the dynamics between these three characters
and then we have great and tyme i did feel like i wanted them to have a bit more of a chat before moving on to the nc scene but then they looked at each other and i honestly stopped caring lmao the gentle hair brush the way great kept laughing a little it all felt so real honestly kudos to whoever is directing all those intimate scenes and the actors executing them chefs kiss no notes
im also wondering if their closeness being slightly rushed is intentional if theyre feeling more drawn to each other because they already have history that great is vaguely recalling from wherever and this is making them feel closer and more trusting of each other than they should maybe be
also i assume the other person in that red room that woman was seeing was great but i thought it looked more like tyme tbh or am i just imagining things
no we are not okay boys what have you done to us


i mean i love them however adrenaline induced sex does not look this calm though 

4 minutes is amazing
the second amazing thing is coming here and reading those shameless comments 
and i am here for it

perfect 10 liners
i knew this episode was gonna be steamy but it exceeded my expectations the jesbible debut was spectacular and it seems tonkla got his wish because i didnt see officer stache suit up
also what was that ending i have so many questions

for the millionth time imma say it again fuaiz better be getting that bagggg also we been knew who his brother was but i was still gagged so my theory is that there are two worlds the one before and after the 4 minutes
the way bible and jes were smiling through the nc scene was so cute


bocs cinematography
omg i was right hahaha  peep my post before the episode started we have overlapping timelines
the difference between then tongkla and now tongkla is staggering i dunno  i feel like korn groomed him korn obviously does love tongkla but he was tongklas first lover rescued him from an abusive household bought him a house gilded cage promised him that he would tell the world that he was tongklas boyfriend  only to have a fiancee and tongkla is still the dirty secret sidepiece that he doesnt call for weeks and only comes to fuck him and didnt care about what tongkla had been going through until tongkla forced the matter you dare to kick me out isnt a line you use with someone that you really truly love
korn was so villainous this episode even the scenes where he was being sweet with tongkla had a sinister undercurrent he groomed this boy hes trying to be good cop with nan even though hes running an illegal casino and trying to have the high ground his reaction to finding out that tongklas brother was dead wasnt oh baby im so sorry let me comfort you it was who did it so i can exert power of them for you to further engraciate you to me
win is such a mess hes down bad for this broken beautiful boy like he looked so pathetic and sad coming out from hiding in his underwear heartbroken that tongkla had someone else he was love at first sight and will never know a moment of peace from now on the way that tongkla was so fucking happy to get fucked raw was hot as hell but just really sad too korn has always kept him at arms length in his lonely apartment and is keeping him a secret so he just wanted to feel something this triangle is so interesting to me
i kinda wish wed gotten more explanation about what exactly is happening with tyme and nan great was just like okay ill help you and there hasnt really been many questions besides that maybe well get some answers next week after theyve fucked it out of their systems props to nan though that girl is not breaking
i loved the contrast between all the sex scenes in terms of tone wintonkla was so desperate and full of need korntonkla was very sweet and innocent except had this sinister air around it because we know how their relationship ended up despite korns pinkie promise and tymegreat was full of smiles and while it was kind of awkward it was very sweet and naturally so the first time is never fireworks
lukwa is so cute her and den in the same scenes just smiling are so healing they both have such great warm smiles so she was the one that great saw which i had already assumed
if greattyme doesnt have a 5 min scene like tonkorn ill shit myself

pahahahahah gorllll i knew it
cacklinggg

the sights the sounds the faces 

im choking


im not sure if its part of the character but dr tymejes has the sweetest most deliberate gestures his index finger here seems to be counting the seconds until he makes his next move



ahhhhhhhhhh we finally got soft bottom bible this bl just keeps getting better and better with every ep 

this picture


bocs cinematography
i love this shot because you can see the power dynamic despite the height difference
ifylita 1 fan 
they have this otherworldly chemistry so casual and sweet i need more screen time of them next ep 

ifylita 1 fan 
tonkla side quest getting fucked raw []
wait is this the first ep with a  rating like how explicit are we actually talking here if we already saw almost everything in the prior episodes  im

im actually glad the main couples nc scene is more soft and slow burn because its going to make the last couple of episodes a lot spicier haha that being said they need a lot more scenes together to make up for the lack of screen time though


ok it took me two watches to soak it all in the first watch had a lot of ff and 20x to see quickly if it was safe now i rewatched fully and calmly and without being completely lost in the incredible varying emotions of the ncs that honestly had me laying on the cold tile floor in my office for a bit
ok here we go
after watching every single episode of criminal minds for yearsi immediately recognized korns manipulation at work since ep1 but in this episode it was clear that he is without the shadow of doubt a narcissistic sociopath who manipulates because it brings him a high that he cant get any other way sociopaths are incapable of feeling love what they feel is adrenaline and power when they can control and inflict emotional pain on other humans while giving the appearance of being well intentioned
from the flashback we learned that korn intentionally made ton kla remove the cat collar he smiled as he watched brokenhearted ton kla kneel down and get the collar anyone with humanity if they truly cared about another human would have removed the collar for them his intentions were not genuine even back then he saw a broken prey that he could mold into everything he wanted and make him dependent on korn emotionally and financially there is zero love from korn ton kla is just a release for korn from the way he feels powerless in his relationship with his father stepmother and fianc and the cat collar was intentioned as reminder to ton kla of korns alleged caring but to korn that was a key to his control he even immediately tied a ribbon around ton klas head to claim his ownership over every thought of tonkla going forward he owns him now forever
their first time shown here in parallel to greattymes first time which was fueled by adrenaline
the scene where we saw title trust great to kills someone with him showed us that greats personality lends to his friends trusting him blindly however when he refused to kill and we were told he also released the imprisoned girl in a prior episode was foreshadowing to todays episode great doesnt hesitate to do the right thingafter he considers and sees the alternative he didnt jump in to help tyme or to save this girl today until after he saw the consequences of his inaction and it makes complete sense that he would help tyme without any hesitation after he heard and saw the consequences of inaction on his part
i dont think this series has any romance tbh this is a series about human intentions and decisions and adrenaline induced action i dont think great is in love with tyme at all and the other way around either they are somehow being pulled together by grief and curiosity and power and mainly adrenaline
and ton kla is now acting towards cop the same way he learned from korn the tables are turned his constant request for raw or up me for those that dont know that means he wants cop to cum inside him is symbolica desperate yearning to feel something real
bas is honestly killing it every micro expression is giving sociopath and the contrast of his gentle voice is perfection he wants to appear gentle while being lethal he did the same exact song and dance with the kidnapped girl as he does with ton kla
and his rage and tear filled eyes when ton kla kicked him out was not hurt because his love kicked him out it was rage that the object he owned had the gall to turn on him
this series is honestly spectacular
every single detail has a purpose cop coming back in without pants shows he is not covering anything up he is raw and exposed and down bad for ton kla he has saviors syndrome he sees a broken boy and wants to be his savior the same way korn seemed to be that but korn was dressed immaculately and wearing panties  and he asked ton kla to remove them while cop immediately willingly removed all his layers korn also asked ton kla not to remove his shirt he said he would do it he kept a layer of the shirt on ton kla their entire first time while with cop ton kla was completely exposed
i know many may say that the ncs are gratuitous and perhaps with a lot more writing the same nuances of these characters could maybe have been told with clothes but the fact that everything in every nc so far has had symbolic meaning is spectacular
also bibles tats had me so dead also greats red car has me in a chokehold however i wish they didnt ride the gears like they did cause my heart hurt for the car
great screaming oh shit and just yelling on the bridge also told us that great is highly addicted to this adrenaline he has been mostly calm from our pov but today showed us that adrenaline is definitely a drug he liked at first try
note 4 minutes from the hair
black cat from ep1 then we had the cats from the claw machine too lots of cats oh god then we have greats actual cat man i hope nothing happens to that cat 


bocs cinematography
hard agree about korn there was something so sinister about him this episode

is it really a bas series wo bas getting drunk and letting loose lol
anyone else think clip before the credits are the real version of events ep1 great is in hospital coding at 11 oclock whilst tyme is being gunned down ep2 tongkla murdering someone with a rock ep3 a body is found ep4 murder investigations with someone being linked by dna cop guy seems to know the name
greats scenes appear fragmented to me we dont see much interaction with tyme they just kind of end up in places like their date when they are in the hotel room great even laughs saying he doesnt know where they are its all safe and romantic when theyve just gone on the run supposedly we dont see great question anything thats happening with his family and tymenan hes mostly in white and tyme in black i think hes reliving memories that great and tyme are dying at the same time
my guess with tongkla is that he manipulated moustache cop into helping him find out who killed his brother afterwards once they find out the police protected title he helps him get revenge i think moustache cop is the one shooting tyme but then where does korn fit into it all and why is tyme a victim i dont know why we are seeing dome go back to tongklas house other than tongkla is hallucinating
the 4 minutes room with that lady im guessing is some kind of pergatory i cant explain the psychologist friend of tymes meeting the lady and great though
sorry for long comment i cant sleep  loved this episode and reading everyones theories

yall im not prepared for whatever is about to happen 
prayer circle for us all to survive 
its happeninggggg dont hold ur breath 


i am shook that we saw actual dick shook
omg


bocs cinematography
you dare kick me out
bitch the way you were just manhandling him after weeks of no contact without asking why he seemed so down man fuck korn there was something so villainous about him this episode

i am glad he kicked him out he deserves so much better but i think he is definitely not over him

18 clockt
get it boys 


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
durex did not sponsor this episode i repeat durex did not sponsor this episode 
i love tonklawin scenes sm sad broken boys is my jam and tonkla is delivering on that part and win is just willing to give and give and give to someone that cannot reciprocate is both heartbreaking and hilarious to watch the man is whipped
bible was magnetic in this episode the way he portrayed being on a adrenaline high and trying to calm down from that the way he laughed and smiled at tyme before and during sex was mesmerising i didnt feel like the greattyme sex scene was too intimate there was a lightness to it like they were comfortable with each other but not yet in love w each other
if we assume that there are two timelines and each timeline has its own people like there is the tonkla that lost his brother and the tonkla that didnt then that means there should be another great there is a great that did not save any of the people hes saved in the past 4 episodes including tyme i think that that great is the one having a heart attack stuck for 4 minutes somewhere between life and death trying to fix everything before its too late


while i dont mind the tonkla win and korn triangle story i am disappointed at how little screentime greattyme is getting i havent actually paid attention to minutes but it feels like they arent getting their fair share considering they are supposed to be the main couple 
their nc scene almost felt a bit sudden to me because we didnt have much of a relationship progression during the episode it went from rescue the girl to first time so quickly it felt a bit odd i hope we get to see more of them and what their deals are from now on

ngl im 35 minutes in and im a tiny bit annoyed at how korn tonkla focused this is particularly since this is the intheatre ep i have no problem with side couples but the balance is starting to feel really off with the amount of scenes weve had of korntonkla and wintonkla vs the very little with tyme and great
sigh anyway will come back here later with more


really i would not mind if the whole show is about them i normally prefer the main couple too but here tonkla and his triangle have stolen my heart and attention

already screaming

lmao this show


omg that was absolutely insane 
there were exactly 3 sex scenes multiple butts so many snatched waistlines and a dick
also i dont even know where to begin theorizing and were halfway done
i woke up this morning and remembered this kiss
tonkla 

earthmix 
i knew it

time seems to pause as they hover close a beautiful blend of longing and restraint its like their world and perhaps ours too shrinking to just this moment tymes kisses is so purposeful shows so much intent
we indeed had a great time with greattyme pun intended


best pun of the day 


i am yet again reminded that i hope this show had a good intimacy coordinator on set 


pond is the intimacy director and he ensures there is a closed set so just the actors and the camera guy and maybe 1 lighting person if needed

is this sub dead or what are other people watching im so excited for this series every week 


we are watching in fetal position atm heavily medicated


listen i dont know if it was just me but i think i waited more from the nc scene of greattyme or maybe their scene is to be more like this more romantic than the ones from tonkla to show us a more deep romantic connection between greattyme
like even the scene of tonklawin was more hornier than theirs
i dont even feel like this episode was that on fire 18 like they had been saying for a week in that poster
anyways so dome really was tonkla brother at the end i guess tonkla killed title the brothers murderer remember that opening scene from episode 2
i wonder what will happen with tonkla and the cop because that scene of korn wanting to force tonkla excuse me you can see that tonkla no longer loves korn like he did in the past he just waited him to get out to go down on win oo
this is really getting toxic now i can sense a big jealous murderous beating moment coming up oh my god oo
at this point im definitely more involved and interested with korn tonkla and win story than the mains sorry


i thought the same on the greattyme scene but hopefully we will get more from them theirs was definitely framed as more romantic so thats likely why it wasnt as over the top
ditto i was all set for it to be intense and serious given the buildup however those little moments of chatter between them actually brought a suprising warmth there was so much thoughtfulness in their exchanges judging from the deliberations even though its clear how much they want each other at this point im already rooting for them to have a happily ever after but of course we all know theyre just getting started

i feel the same way but theres more nc scenes to come cause that aint the one they advertised on the pilot thank god

omg kan and tul finally 


so little was explained and it happened so suddenly but my lordt the scene with great and tyme at the end was one of the most beautiful first time scenes ive ever seen a tiny bit awkward yet soft and tender ahh

jes doesnt walk he glides and steps through spaces as if the ground beneath him is merely a suggestion rather than a barrier fml i am obsessing over this again i need help


 i love this so much i am seeing fragments of jes through these onairs someone is obessed with the way he taps his index finger i love all of these micro observations so much putting them all together is beautiful

i was not expecting to see a soft  in a bl drama before

am ecstatic because baskorns sexy peaches are here againoh lets add dr tymesif the black cat was dead while korn and tonkla was still at uni then the black cat after the first nc scene with korn and tonkla was a flashbacklove the contrast great in white dr tyme in blackso it was lady lukwa with great in the 400 minute roomthree people held that rock the murder weapontitlegreattonklaso which of these three is mr anuwat warindej whose fingerprints are in the police database which means this person has a prior record


if the black cat was dead while korn and tonkla was still at uni then the black cat after the first nc scene with korn and tonkla was a flashback
so i was thinking the same thing mayne not necessarily a flashback but somehowe inside of ton klas mind just like the cab seemed like dome was alive like wishful thinking or both ton kla and great are kinda dying and we are seeing inside both of their brains

alright at the end of the day i dont really know whats going on ive read all the theories here and on mdl ive watched every ep at least twice and ep 2 five times
it could be that sammon has revealed all the clues and its just a matter of putting them together and someone here has already gotten it right it could also be that shes withholding key clues that once revealed would rule out everyones theories
i think sammon has played with both corruption and timeline changes in her past works so its not clear to me which direction she may take it im not going to focus on the question of timelines  alternate realities ill wait for more information
i do think that were seeing many morally grey characters im not sold on any of our mains  great tyme tonkla korn win  being all good or all bad not even title is all bad he didnt seem like a bad friend to great when we first meet him tyme seems like a cold jerk but is obviously very tender to his grandma and is fighting for a good cause great makes bad choices and regrets them
i also think were seeing how sex can be experienced and used in a variety of ways  love desperation escape control i agree with uthoughtsallday that were learning so much through those sex scenes the difference between ton klas blissed out love expression after he and korn have sex in ep 1 is in stark contrast to his expressionlessempty face after he has sex with win greattyme seem to be just two dudes who fell for each other and are actually having like relationship sex which is both attraction and connection its maybe not my favorite storytelling technique but its definitely well telling a story
at the end of the day i think the series has an interesting plot and is something different than usual and thats fun i liked the series more when i thought it was going to be romance and a happy ending but this is not that so now im a bit emotionally distant from it because sammon isnt here to comfort me and make me believe in the power of love at least i dont think she is i dont know ive never finished a sammon series
i mean personally i prefer explicit yearning tension romance more cardigans and a guaranteed happy ending over like murder sadness and graphic desperation sex but i am happy to be watching something in realtime again as part of a community


sammon isnt here to comfort me and make me believe in the power of love at least i dont think she is i dont know ive never finished a sammon series
 yeah sammon is not one that likes to comfortsadly
im glad you were able to come to terms with the fact this isnt a romance yet are still finding ways to enjoy it differently this may be the first sammon series you finish especially given it is 8 eps not 13 as per her usual
you may not be comforted by sammon but i cant explain to you the comfort i feel seeing you engaged in this puzzle of clues 



you have talked about the nc scenes so my turn to talk about the mystery
the theory of at least two timelines has been proven true
in one of them dome is alive and happily talking and visiting tonkla and in the other one is dead and tonkla is grieving
i read the theory that the happy timeline doesnt exist and its just great fixing his mistakes in his mind before passing away sincerely i hope you are not right i know boc shows doesnt characterize for having a super happy endings but i dont need a show where everyone is dead hello there dff
if there are two timelines then we havent met yet the key characters in the other timeline
we havent watched tonkla in the happy timeline where his brother is alive he talked with dome on telephone but we just saw the sad tonkla who doesnt see his brother
we havent watched great and tyme in the sad timeline except in the prologue where both of them are dying great didnt save the woman in the first episode dome and nan in this timeline so he probably is not a goody two shoes and we dont know tyme either but i think he is more or less the same in both timelines
ps i know a lot of you are fed up of tonkla having too much screentime but he has to be a key character maybe the antagonist so probably is not wasted time

thoughts this the day i have still a few hours to go but ill be glued to my seat


omg i dont knowwww all signs point to yes  but i dont knowwww ive seen spoilers from korea since it already aired there but they are from scenes that were in the trailer so not sure 

im sorry but when will bible get kissed the way he deserves lmaooooo and lets be real that bottom was not having fun 
still love the ep tho jes still is an eye candy love seeing and hearing him 
i love this plot kinda getting tired of tonklas nc scenes but he acts so well


jes at least kissed him back unlikehe who shall not be namedcough build

bocs cinematography
really because i saw it as great staring intently at tyme drinking in all his reactions unlike the other nc scenes  win and tongkla only passingly looked at each other because it was all about desperate pleasure and korn and tongkla felt so meticulous like korn was taking tongkla apart psychically and physically but great cared how tyme was reacting he wanted to see the effect he was having he wasnt moaning and wailing and arching but you dont look that intently at someone during sex if youre having a bad time you tend to face away or stare up at the ceiling or keep your eyes closed

well that episode certainly was an episode
damn
im so confused tho but im confident that it wont be a mess like chains of heart 


im looking forward to some point in the future when i can watch this with proper subtitles im sure it will make even more sense


heres my rating on the realism of the nc scenes in this episode from the perspective of a gay male haha im just going by order and leaving out names for spoilers sake this is just based on realism not my enjoyment 
6510 the spice is there for sure but the facial expressions from the actors are a bit over exaggerated it feels a bit comical without context also no lube or prepping in sight lol
810 a rather short scene so not much to judge but pretty realistic overall if they were going to do anything in that position however the top should probably be a little lower
8510 one of the better first time scenes but again they kind of skip over any lubeprepping what makes it good though is the pacing and body placementnatural movement from both actors only thing is the bottoms thighs should up a little higher the moaning pauses kisses in between and natural movement definitely shows both actors experience though


ok so i had already lost all hope of korn being a good guy back when he took over the illegal part of the business without seemingly having any issues with it and then obv how he just straight up ignored poor tonkla in the last episode
but man this episode just drove it home further that he is a baad dude he didnt contact ton for weeks and then just shows up whines about the bad time hes had and immediately wants some action without picking up on ton obviously being down and then doesnt even jump to comforting mode when he is told that tons brother got killed wow
the flashback to them during college is so sad all things considered
ton was obviously inexperienced and prob also seeking love and support after coming from a shitty household and korn really moulded him into his perfect little dirtysecretsidepiece that he could use and control with promises of love and future commitments
no wonder ton is messed up and confused

fujin
ive said it multiple times but im convinced great is fixing all his mistakes in this second timelinethe one that involved the death of tonklas brother nan tyme and eventually his own even with an omniscient narrator theyre unreliable because the timelines arent clear they mix together and leave us confused
seeing jjs penis definitely wasnt on my bingo card though im not sure if it was his or a prosthetic and honestly im not sure if i want to know


though im not sure if it was his or a prosthetic
im here after 6 rewatches

i have those 3 pretty clocked
greattyme are my homework right now 
im loving the story a lot and i still dont have any theories lol however i do feel a bit odd about fuaiz with all of this sex scenes considering he just turned 18



you should definitely not watch this episode or this series or the prior 3 episodes and definitely do not look at the gifs on this post run go fast trying to save you so you can uphold your stance



earthmix 
edited because english eludes me

cause of death the heart killers 
what in the parallel universe


im not getting parallel universe vibes i think ton kla is having hallucinations like the cat in ep1
like  left and right 3 nc scenes and  turned 
nah im leaving 

come back we need to get lost in this maze together


late to the party but omg this episode
heir from a powerful family  why do i think korn killed tonklas brother
tonkla meeds therapy i hate this whole wintonklakorn situation feels icky who am i supposed to hate here 
sorry ive been gone for so long i had something urgent to take care of okay but tonklas brother was murdered and tonkla was left to manage it all alone you selfish fuck hate that he was literally just there for sex he didnt even bother asking about tonkla lowkey so exciting when he kicked korn out kinda feel bad for win hes so whipped and tonkla just doesnt know what he wants i mean besides a raw fuck 
omg who killed the cat tonkla is either a psychopath or its korn neither of them are giving very sane vibes korn killing everyone and everything close to tonkla so he has only korn to rely on or tonkla is a psychopath or has something like schizophrenia and isnt aware of what hes doing
side note sometimes when i look at tonkla at a certain angle briefly he looks like hyunjin
oh korn for sure groomed tonkla and tonkla loves him but has slowly realised over the years hes actually a massive lying cunny oh because he took over the family business makes total sense its always the family business turning people into simply the worst people poor tonkla still a side piece whilst korn is engaged to fasai i want to know the story there do you love him though korn
4 minutes being the amount of time the brain can survive without oxygen leads me to believe this entire thing is great having some sort of hallucination whilst he dies like maybe he really knows these people and wishes he did things differently and thats why he keeps imagining something different with the 4 minutes thing or maybe this whole thing is just a complete fantasy and none of these people are even connected
damn nan is really going through it no idea what her connection in all of this is yet but i feel bad shes clearly been tortured hope the guy who punched and kicked her dies xoxox
nah you dont get to be sad korn
the fact that they know it was great who got nan out is not going to bode well for his relationship with korn but it apparently gas for his relationship with thyme yeooooowwww lets go love that he doesnt even know where they are
the hairrrr the forehead kissssssss the giggles aw theyre so gentle i wonder if those leg tatts are real the comment that said their full sex scene was 4 minutes long  you just know theyre gonna backtrack on that next episode 
lol i forgot about this guy wait hold the fuck up theres two timelines going on here so he is tonklas brother and in that case it was title who killed him i am so so confused the plot thickens
next week needs to hurry up actually


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
yes those are bibles real tats on his thighs

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
fuaiz getting it again as he should
although theres so much sadness behind his actions it makes me feel bad



yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
dont stone me but it felt like great wasnt really showing enjoyment during the nc scene guess i was expecting more moans and visuals of him lost in bliss gasping for air
it was still incredibly sweet and soft and i liked that but with how hyped it was i was hoping to see something more idk aggressive or emotionally laden shocking etc not that emotions werent there but you get me
maybe its meant to be a slow burn in the nc department for tyme and great so lets see how far they take it maybe theyll surprise us


i think we were all expecting the scenes he keeps seeing in his memories and the one we all keep seeing in our minds from the trailer
so yes i was disappointed too again due to erroneous expectations not because the scene was bad also the whole prior scenes being about adrenaline also made me expectadrenaline fueled sex which this was not
so i think the expectations were not met given the hype and what we know the trailer and greats memories showed us and that adrenaline discussion prior to the scene

oh my god this show never fails  those tattooed thighs jfc although i was surprised how soft the tyme great scene was but im not mad
i have never been more confused and entertained im assuming its a different timeline situation i have no clue whats going on though im just enjoying the rideing


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
ill only get to watch this tomorrow help


first of all congratulations on ton kla for finally getting what he wants after 3 episodes also the boy needs some rest he is caring the 18 rating on his shoulders for way too many episodes now now that this is out of the way what if the seeing into the future thing is just great looking back on what he sees as his mistakes and trying to rectify them somehow creating like a fork in the timeline that sometimes seeps into the reality but it is not actually real i know i dont make much sense but this is what this series is doing to me comment image

soooooo the ending of episode 4 wtf is going on  i like a good bc scene like the rest but i need to know what great parents did to tymes parents qtna


annnndddd is anuwat is it title because where is he is he dead did title kill him sooo who did great save  dome is dead or nooooowho left the hospital what timeline are we in 


i am severely confused about a few things
first in tonklas flashback he and korn were already a couple but had never had sex so was that tonklas first time because how can they be a couple when korn didnt know basic things like tonkla has no experience in kissing so hes going to teach him how to do it but then they are like i love you so much help or having sex confessing and becoming a couple all happened in that day lol
is dome alive in the same dimension that tonkla is in or could it be that the influence of the 4 minutes has affected something because how come we see dome alive but tonkla and the inspector consider him dead

tonkla finally was fucked raw we celebrate that his dream came true
inspectors dong was out bro
who is mr anuwat warindej
the difference between two people who love each other korn and tonkla  at least in the flashback and ep1 and when one is only using the other tonkla to the inspector i really appreciate the quality of acting we are getting the dynamics are totally different and i can even feel the difference
my toxic trait of wanting more of tonkla and korn cause im living their chemistry fukkkkkk
i didnt expect tyme and great having sex this episode i dont know the timeline of their relationship is strange i feel we barely see them interact this episode and also tyme second agenda cause dude wants revenge so is he really into great or just playing him
edit word

all of this im so confused and so intrigued this show is great 
episode was overhyped probably the weakest to me but show is still 1110


overhyped nc wise however incredible progress to the plot in this episode

so did tonk get bred by the cop cause i didnt see a indication of a condom being put on


up me  come inside me so yes he got his wish


spoiler deeper thoughts on one specific scene
now that ive found the ween i am curious about tymegreat and their nc scene it was so missionary  so boring  did great even finish was it tymes first time with a man it wasnt passionate at all  the opposite of what i would expect postinsane rescue mission it was almost like great was directing tyme not in it for himself at all
very diff from tonwin and notfirsttime tonkorn
the tymegreat scene was almost grounding them stabilizing them vs revving things up
given how much thought boc gives and how many details there are this cant be a coincidence
figured out the spoiler issue  sorry


agreed it was boring and very much the opposite of adrenaline fueled sex not sure if doc was doing it to calm great down i just rewatched it for the 5th time and i just dont know if maybe jes was nervous af and bible has more experience in this realm and with pond intimacy director but yes it definitely looked like great was walking tyme through this i have had major adrenaline rushes where you are just insanely overstimulated laughing on the bed so i dont know how great went directly from that to being super calm and a teacher of the art of sex maybe this was tymes first time with a man the nurses said he had an ex girlfriend maybe great does boys a lot so he was teaching tyme the ways of the boys i dont know but yes i have been turning this over and over in my head and something doesnt fit 
so who wears it best love love love this top tho


love it
ucastlekd your boy appeared in the 4 minutes onairs 
saipon long beans oabplawan 
spy hands down also unwears it the best too


up until now everything appeared normalif one can consider seeing four minutes into the future as normal however the revelation that dome is ton klas brother complicates matters significantly he was the one great was supposed to have rescued in episode 2 from domes kidnapper and future murderer title yet he was found dead and cremated in this episode this raises intriguing possibilities are we witnessing two parallel worlds or are we experiencing greats mind while he is in a coma or perhaps during a heart attack
the possibilty of parallel worlds or alternate realities suggests a narrative that may blur the lines between what is real and what could be imagined or altered by the characters experiences
but it can also be something different i have untill now no idea do we see the events in the wrong order that dome is murdered after he had been saved by great
ton klas fingerprints are all over the murderweapon of the unknown victim how is win going to handle that he is madly in love with ton kla how is he going to hide that evidence from his superiors
additionally theres the bribed chief of win who has taken over domes case he seems to be under the influence of powerful individuals and win is being followed could titles family be behind this it hints at a deeper conspiracy which raises questions about power dynamics and who is pulling the strings behind the scenes
and what about nam is she possibly tymes sister or another victim of greats parents
thus far this episode has left us with more questions than answers it certainly pushes the boundaries of thai bl particularly with its daring portrayal of intimacy
as a dutch viewer i find that seeing a mans private parts in a tv series is not new to me i witnessed such depictions quite often in the eighties which now seems long past however it appears that thai bl or should i say boc has entered a boundarybreaking era
win is portrayed in a vulnerable light and ton klas experiences are depicted with raw honesty including the intimate scenes the tender deflowering of ton kla by korn in happier times highlights their deep affection for one another they once had
moreover the first encounter between great and tyme is particularly poignant possibly marking their first experiences with a man tymes concern for great is evident in his gentle gesturesa peck on the forehead a playful bite on the nosefollowed by a moment of anticipation as he waits for great to respond even then tymes gaze remains attentive ensuring that great is alright both in that moment and beyond
lukwa has been asked by dr den earlier from what aspect of life her ability to see 4 minutes in the future comes from cause he explained that what patienst having seen in the moment when they had a cardiac arrest depends on their beliefs religion experiences etc
when she stopped by dr den to give him some food and also to answer that question she has thought about it she beliefs she was in that place before ithan you see her in a white room it was in a art gallery and hear the explanation about 4 minutes the time the brains can survive without oxygen and the question what happens during that time to our consciousness her question is if that is why she thinks she can see 4 minutes into the future because of that number mentioned
dr den asks her when she was there but she cant remember exactly how and when she went in the art gallery vague memories but that she was not alone there there was another person in my opinion that can be no one else than great


i did like an hourlong thought exercise last night of what if dome lived came home and then was subsequently killed but when i played that out it didnt make sense that who murdered him would be such a mystery because theyd have a record of domes hospital visit great taking him there and also being injured and views police report of title kidnapping her there would be enough detail  people for win to easily put together title as a suspect so i dont think its the case that dome lived was released and then was subsequently killed

are we witnessing two parallel worlds or are we experiencing greats mind while he is in a coma or perhaps during a heart attack
i feel like going 2 timelines is getting extremely messy and its more like one route where someone is exploring the alternative options my current headcanon is that great is dying and considering all the choices he made that led him here eg he should have left the woman on the road or he should have run past tyme he shouldnt have saved nan etc
ton klas fingerprints are all over the murderweapon of the unknown victim
was that mentioned explicitly in the show i didnt actually connect that but we did see a scene of him bashing someone up could either be title for killing dome korn for stringing him alongor even dome he did look a bit psycho when we saw the cat scene
it might be title because the police mentioned that 2 people were killed the same way and it could be title killing dome and subsequently tong kla killing title win then meets tk and gets the call that his fingerprints are on the rock
do we see the events in the wrong order that dome is murdered after he had been saved by great
i did wonder that especially since theyre so concerned with the time that they never show us dates but i think its a little too coincidental that hes killing him in the exact same place and location
but that she was not alone there there was another person in my opinion that can be no one else than great
weve seen great have that vision before i think the fact that she realises he was there were the 2 of them dying at the same time or do all these people with visions enter the same realm
so many questions so little answers


we can keep talking about the nc scenes but guys the theories from what ive seen people believe that there are seperate timelines and great is stuck in a different timeline and all we will know about it more in the future coming eps but my god the series is so good so far everything about it is phenomenal



im here for fuaiz constantly getting dicked down honestly i kinda need him and bas to become a fixed pair
i havent seen it yet im so excited

ahhh i gotta watch this brb 



waah kudos to the writers im loving the plot twist
also bas needs to keep the hairstyle that we see in the fbs i mean he looks handsome both waysin that style even morefor me its always hair downhair up  bas is doing amazing here
also not to be rude but enough with tonkla ncs fuaiz needs a break from that many ncshes still a 19 yr old kidi feel old not to act like a moral police but boc couldve been a bit considerate of him or given him fast cut ncs more than this much explicit ncs he feels like the main character tho with complex storyline so lets dive into his brothers mystery hes also doing a great job
bas fuaiz bed talk was wow they look so much in love i loved it that soft fluffy moment
i dont mind greattyme thogive me more mystery along the way
winjj seems a bit heart broken
and korn situation is kinda sad his business changed him completely he lost himself even more
i love this show tho


bl drama enthusiast
can someone explain what is happening with the boy that got beat up and put in hospital is that tonklas brother and theres two parallel universes im so confused who tonklas brother is and how hospital boy fits in



apparently we have different time line now i tried to make a diagram here 
if i miss some important stuff please tell me guys ill correct my diagram


hospital boy is dome yes that is ton klas bro i think he is a hallucination of ton kla he is dead but ton kla is reimagining


cherry magic 
 also  and the  wasnt about the nc scenes itself it was because of  i saw no post about that  why 
and the tattooos 
okay okay lets try to put some words there  its just superb in every aspects suspens relationship development psychology photography 


lol it was implied up top where i said very explicit lol

bocs cinematography
i didnt mention dick at all because i had no idea until this second where

omg  great episode just great i really love how they show the different aspects of the characters every detail is a clue
since we are now sure we are dealing with different time lines i will need tab to keep track xd if i think its good enough ill post it


yes please share i am pretty positive the cop at his office and the phone call happens later than we think because eventhough cop helped at the funeral i dont see ton kla calling him just on a tuesday morning

i was waiting for tonkla to be dped 


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
im at the point where tyme fixes greats messy hair and i dont know if my heart is ready for whats about to ensue

just dont forget to breathe for the next 4 minutes


i have to say i am glad we got mad tonkla with korn most others will quick jump to the forgiveness but him kicking korn out was perfect i enjoy a good argument in series

all i have is questions
where is title was he one of the dead bodies
how did knowing greats surname influence tymes desire to get to knowget close to great was he genuinely attracted to great in the er since he hates greats family was his first goal to use great somehow in his revenge but then he reveals his face to great after going after korn and then great helps him so i guess hes decided great is ok after all
for the tymegreat nc scene i assume that jes already has a big fandom from all of the het dramas hes made it might be detrimental to his career to do fullon nc greats flashbacks seem more passionate than the one in this episode but i wont be surprised if their nc scenes are never as fullon as tonklakorn or tonklagreat i liked the lightheartedness of this scene and the developing connection it might have been the first time with a guy at least for both of them
my only issues with the all of the nc scenes so far is the timing they are shot as though we see everything from start to finish and yet the finish is within maybe 30 seconds i like that they are semirealistic tymes sweat was the icing on the cake but i would have preferred the illusion of longer sex scenes a time skip for some prep for getting comfortable for enough blood to be diverted to the important places for an orgasm to have some basis in reality lol
korn wants to prove himself to his father and goes along with the illegal stuff he hasnt commented on how he feels about it yet he wanted nan to be unhurt but doesnt have the authority to ensure that which says something about where the real power still is his father
i love how this series isnt wasting any time every scene every interaction is important


i am caught up and obsessed with this show now first off my favorite is ton kla idk if people have been complaining about his screen time but i dont care i love seeing him on screen hes so interesting to me especially the way his dynamic shifts from korn to win ooooh hes taking it the look he gives win just shows he has all the power in their relationship i love to see it
besides that i think hes going to have a really important part in the future especially since im not sure what hell do and what will go down when korn finds out the end scene though yup dome is definitely his brother but i wonder whats going on with the timeline cause we know dome is dead from ton klas pov but up till that last scene he was still alive idk i guess well have to see
also yay for greattyme getting together this ep at least physically lol


anyone else see that starting aug 24th with the 5th episode it will be in gagaoolala too

i can do it with a broken heart
here we go my incoherent thoughts and reactions as i watch this right now
so its pmor and nan but why and how i wonder oooh well that wasnt a surprise at all was it tyme trying to get back at greats family
ok im certain now tonkla and tyme will team up to get revenge because korn killed tonklas little brother or korns people did who cares
weirdly enough the uncut version is now searchable in viu in my territory indonesia but it says that youd need viu premium not just the regular premium and the only way to get it is by contacting their customer service i vaguely remember premium being available overthecounter a month ago so i assume theyre doing id check now i havent actually done it i guess its all because of this show i dont see anything else even remotely sexual


can you please tell me how many minutes does the uncut version have


i have so many questions  is tonkla in the other timeline where dome was killed by title or did great taking dome to the hospital not save him and hes in some kind of purgatory or are the timelines converging since great is changing so many things ngli have a feeling we are heading to a sad ending for our main couple tonkla finally got what he wanted and win is so pathetically in love with this boy 


or is this all just a dream of greats while hes dying in the hospital and when the clock strikes 1104 he dies



is anyone else having an error with the episode loading the vpn is connected i have the premium viu but im getting network error while downloading it wont let me attach the screenshot of the error though

who was the name at the beginning of this the murderer

anuwat which was shown to be tonklas name on the booklet that was handed out at the 4 minutes fanmeet

as a lurker of this subreddit i am forever grateful i just started watching this

welcome welcome thank you for coming up for air heh


im so glad for these unhinged on airs because im not able to actually watch the show my own stubborn refusal to figure out a vpn and pay for yet another streaming service at least i get to know whats happening from you all

can i ask why this episode was rated 21


i am still piecing together theories on this i feel like im going to have to rewatch everything once it ends to see how it fits i think im watching multiple linear timelines and they connect somehowwe just havent gotten to that point yet like there is a gap in the before and after or the parallel
the nc scenes are so informative i feel like we get a lot of emotional feedback from how they all interact with one another i will not complain about the great tyme scene i feel like it came across as natural even if it was missing something idk the tenderness was not something i was expecting to see given all the other nc scenes thus far i think their kissing scenes are very well done its definitely a visual feast thighs tattoos on a man in an intimate setting is something ive never seen in person i must say it was sexy the checkins the physical touch eye contact came across as soft and vulnerable even though it felt slightly detached for me towards the end but i liked that about it i feel like it was deliberately done
im going to watch ep 5 tomorrow cant wait i have a feeling that korn is going to catch tonkla and win together at some point and i am not sure if i am ready to see how that falls out so much to anticipate

i want to watch 4 minutes uncensored where is the resources
any one can tell me where to watch the ep 4  i tried to watch it on the plataform viu but i couldnt

can someone kindly enlighten me im literally so confused right now i thought tonkla brother was supposed to be alive based on ep 2 like didnt great turn back time or smt and saved him wtf now hes dead in ep4 someone pls explain to me i literally went back to rewatch ep 2 im srsly so confused

is anyone else just getting an unexpected error every time they try to watch on viu im using express vpn to thailand and no matter what i do it just keeps giving me an error

soooooo i just came from facebook and someone posted a pic of win coming from out of the room after tonkla told whats his name to leave the housebruh he came out with no pants on and no underwear like i was staring at the pic for dang near 2 mins to realize what was in the pic and yooooo this manhishis weewee was out just out like i was not expecting to see penis   in the show 

i still havent started watching but my jaw is on the floor with each gif i see here goddamn i need to start watching soon 


havent started watching this one yet but bro these men are fire
