sultrier version is fucking peak boc really won 

jesus fcking christ i literally had to pause for a sec there they were not lying about the sultrier version woahhhh

like it kept going and the camera work was amazing holding shots and a good balance of tight shots and zoomed out shots gagged


lol this gif is literally both of us rn
yeah it was done masterfully a whole ass new benchmark right there everybody should learn from them

it gagged me up more than wayujaos scene in two worlds and i thought that was the best scene of the year this truly makes that look like something from star hunter lol

no pls dont remind me of big dragon 
havent watched two worlds yet but as for nc scenes its love sea for me this year well it was until now 

it was hot but i can see the heartbreak and frustration they will put me through

i know and after dff im worried about fuaiz literally praying for bb

cause of death the heart killers 
ok they really won and they are screwing us all with their shenanigans of vpn and stuff 

and now social media will do all the promo for them and make interfans even more ravenous when they finally announce a platform so evil


cause of death the heart killers 
actual footage of boc right now

boc posted an ig story of i think the audience in the theater screaming and covering their eyesmouths during the nc scene

i gasped  bc what is this
im at a loss for words and this rarely happens it was so soft and hard at the same time they looked phenomenal

yes its like so ott smut but still so sweet and romantic the same sort of vibe lie kinnporsche boc really knows how to give layers and show colors its truly amazing

34 minutes in you will absolutely fucking die i am absolutely dead kp nc scenes were disney compared to this can you fuck me raw so i can feel it jesus christ i cannot breathe
also ep1 overall stunning


i had to pause omg what did i just watch sjkskalalal


i am unalive right now 


i am surprised how good the camera angles were like i think havent seen in a bl yet


the camera angles improved tremendously from kp to dff but 4 minutes is on another level completely


bocs cinematography
whyyyyyyy do i have to still be at work for the next 5 hours


this is an emergency you need to leave work immediately
the cinematography is just so fucking kvnt this is why boc can treat its interfans like dog shit lol because hew else is doing it  this level 


bocs cinematography
nobody can touch them when it comes to cinematography
did not expect bible to be turning all these lewks tbh 

hes such a babe 


and hes supposed to be 21 a baby 


i could not focus on anything here cause that fit is absofuckinglutely stunning and breathtaking and like whoever thought of this is a genius and bible is a freaking work of art 

helpppppp


i immediately thought oh were getting this from bible too

in one of his lives he said this role really pushed him and challenged him in ways he didnt expect and jes was an amazing partner to go on this journey with so i think so he better lmao

i can see that challenged him to the moon using your gif btw 

i hope it challenged him good
i can do it with a broken heart
trust you to gift us with this gif orgy thank you for your service

i fell off the couch and died while yelling and screaming

i was eating chips and literally choked  all the screamingsounds they were making  i wonder if jjay is gonna be bas henchman and thats how him and fuaiz are gonna meet and it will be lub  first sight omg still dying

can we give a standing ovation to these ppl pls





his eye contact and eye acting was absolutely incredible
when he made his request and it looked like it was not gonna be granted his eyes immediately looked so sad and disappointed and the reaction from korn when he saw those eyes was to immediately rethink his opening of the condom and he looked at him deep in his eyes and said condom be dammed and threw it on the floor  and then here when he ensured his man came cause only one of them being satisfied was not right 

a gif says a thousand words heh

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
he sure did an a job in ep 1
i dont think ive ever seen an intimacy coordinatordirector credit in a bl or at least i never noticed

how i feel watching the nc scene
if i didnt wanna see this so bad id boycott it bc of bocs bad handling of internationalglobal release 
making fans wait years and now this


the ghosting is what has me livid i get it money talks they signed a deal with viu to use our love of bible to allow viu to softly enter new markets without needing to invest so in exchange viu gave them probably more money than they would for a viu original but then boc should say something or reply to the hundreds of messages posts asking for info on global streaming on their socials
they just needed to put out one post explaining and saying sorry guys we love you but we needed to do this to be able to make 4 minutes the way it deserved i would have understood
but putting out a warning to not watch on nonauthorized channels when there are no authorized channels except for 89 countries is insane and insulting while also providing instructions and time lines on how to make the series trend they had time to create three instruction posts but could not do one addressing the lack of global platform ugh
why do they keep doing this to bible bible needs to find a new company 


but putting out a warning to not watch on nonauthorized channels when there are no authorized channels except for 89 countries is insane and insulting while also providing instructions and time lines on how to make the series trend they had time to create three instruction posts but could not do one addressing the lack of global platform ugh
that was so insensitive just making is walk the plank


ive been waiting for weeks to see if they will say iqiyi and i am just disturbed at this limited release jesbible deserve me paying to watch them weekly and screaming im hurt any word on when we may get to watch legally


zero word from boc they are ghosting  us 


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
they just needed to put out one post explaining and saying sorry guys we love you but we needed to do this to be able to make 4 minutes the way it deserved i would have understood
this is exactly whats pissing me off the most
i mean how hard would it be to just acknowledge the fact instead of ignoring the elephant in the room

gagginggggg screaming
bas i did not know you had that in you lol



i kept yelling basssss what what omfg what is happening why did they hide you all this time 

fuaiz and bas was not a couple i saw happening but dang they look good together fuaiz is a baby though just turned 18 last january


fuaizs eyes are so incredibly expressive he gave us an entire character breakdown and a full monolog just through his eyes in that entire nc scene

 bad guy bosskateer 
i am mesmerized by his eyes they are the prettiest most expressive eyes ive ever seen how is he pulling sexy puppy eyes  l literally cannot watch his eyes enough
it is kind of fierce how boc is so seemingly unbothered lol



viu doesnt even give the 1st episode free like most streamers do jeez
bible he is such a babe im so excited for him also when he couldnt light the cig and he shook his head sigh and said god i died i replayed like so many times is unhealthy
fuaiz is 18 years old he is so young i didnt know that 
that was insane something that caught my attention is that one of the doctors is studying cardiac arrests and a woman gave the example that she could see 4 minutes in the future and here the same thing happens to great could be the dude at the beggining him ans thats how he got this power
why do i find shoulder kisses like this more sexual than the act itself and fuaiz  i have the tendency to still call him white  postcoital look is beautiful


the way they melted into each other was spectacular
also we kept thinking white had something up his sleeve over at dffand here we are this was what we were sensing over there 

flashbackkk


omg was this a hint about the power of his shoulders  like they needed to be covered and protected cause they knew we would self destruct if we knew 
trust the thrust asking  does it hurt shows how much you acknowledge the feelings of your partner love it
but i am sensing a different kind of hurt coming for tonkla very soon right
firstkhao sandray akkayan kantbison 
im ready to throw my money and support a well made bl project if only they allow me  wellvpn it is
wow guys the cinematic production quality of it is superb im buzzing with excitement  also bible speaking english again 


it is a crime that they are limiting viewing when clearly they put forth so much effort into the production 


yeah its just rude and honestly its on them now im watching it somewhere else  if they release it on an international platform like gaga ill gladly watch it again so they can have my money as a support

a very strong start interesting plot good acting great nc scene i was depressed my stand in ended but this will fill its place
 bad guy bosskateer 
that nc scene was so hot so tender so early that im worried one of them is going to die

earthmix 

 if i ever get kissed like this i will melt like butter on a hot skillet 


earthmix 

its the most natural thing to do cause your body cant lie it irks me in situations where couples who have been apart for a while or have made up after a big disagreement barely share a kiss or a proper hug to mark the occasion what in the world is that about anyway
welp this was seriously mind blowing you guys im mind blown actually everything blown


i am unalive i am in shock but also cannot stop rewatching and my mouth is still on the floor
kp was nickelodeon compared to this hbo max

listen i was so ready to throw my hard earned money at another streaming site just for this show i really was but then boc pulled this crap and left me no choice i will definitely pay to rewatch the right way if and when they announce a global streaming site but in the meantime ive waited too long
if boc does nothing else right they will give you a quality production and i mean everything and everyone was so good the pacing the acting the cinematography
the nc scene was  but also kinda soft bas and fuaiz were so sweet with each other
bas stood out so much to me glad hes getting the chance to shine and i love that bible and bas have a good sibling relationship for a second there i was convinced otherwise
yep i knew i would not be disappointed a really great start gagged and seated for the foreseeable future

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
so after a whole bunch of monkeying around i finally got a hong kong vpn  a viu subscription and it worked beautifully until i kid you not the start of the nc scene when it started to buffer i had to turn the quality down to 240p which is hardly worth paying for  at least now if i have to sail the high seas  i wont feel guilty
so far totally worth the hassle the usual high boc production standards and bible yes bible its bible and bas im impressed how he really does appear older than bible here after looking so much younger than him in kp
ive got no words for the nc scene and honestly who needs them that was amazing and not just from an explicitness standpoint but by how well written and directed it was the dialogue felt really real to me anytime someone says how certain actors cant possibly kiss because theyre so young 18 yo fuaiz can say hold my beer and watch this
im looking forward to the plot development and cant wait to see how bible  jes work together
wat so every nc scene will be 4 minutes longest bl nc scene ever lmao


bocs cinematography
if thats the case its fucking genius

i didnt time it but it seemed to go on forever lmao


bocs cinematography
work was the slowest its been in a hot minute and it made the time drag by jesus christ but i finally got to watch after i had to restart my computer nobody wanted me to watch this show
holy fuck this was spectacular because i was looking at this thread i knew the sex scene was coming but honstly i didnt even care i was so engrossed in the story
the music was incredible and of course boc cant be beat when it comes to cinematography and color grading the shots in tongklas house were so pretty i loved the lighting i also loved the location of their underground gambling place such a cool abandoned neighborhood
speaking of that sex scene  okay basfuiaz go off not only was that sex scene hot but it was realistic the way they talked to each other during sex was so natural and real and how they both didnt come at the same time i felt like this was the most real sex scene that ive seen in a bl ever and thank you fuiaz for almost showing us bass asshole i was like you know  you could spread those cheeks a little wider
im so fucking glad to see bible acting again hes so good never over the top even when he was doing over the top stuff as vegas  it was all in pocket and natural id never seen jes act before but he was great too
my fave of the episode though den job was so cute he didnt get much time to shine in kinnporsche but he was excellent here and the glasses made him look super hot
the woman who played mandee was also really good i felt her pain and her son definitely isnt just some rando maybe her son is dead and shes also travelled back and cant handle it
i have so many questions i cant wait to start theorycrafting when we have our footing and really know more about whats happening that was one of the best parts of dff for me  figuring out what was going to happen so we heard a gunshot the first time that great had an episode when he was in his apartment elevator and he clutched his abdomen right where tyme was injured in the cold open are we in an alternate timeline did great go back more than 4 minutes since he can see him and tyme in the future past


oh my fcking god
what a spectacular beginning just amazing gooped and gagged d
fuaiz bas hot damn


its just my opinion but if the release is going to be so limited and you are going to instruct international fans not to watch it or share clips its understandable so dont promote so heavily it on a global platform like youtube or ig just promote it well in your country and let those fans enjoy it to the fullest with our blessings and good wishes
it seems counterintuitive to promote internationally and then act this way
firstkhao sandray akkayan kantbison 
5 minutes in my watch and the question that 1st arrived in my head is this is cinematography  justeverything looks so so good  i have a very particular sense of aesthetics which is why i feel japanese dramas and movies the most well shot and 4 minutes was hitting that hard i had to stop watching and simply admire the shots for a moment also why is gmmtv not shooting more shows in wider shots we all have wider screens in our tabslaptopsmobiles these days whats stopping them whys trainee is the only one

oh my gawddd


that nc scene was insanely hot they werent playing when they said it was the sultrier version they even showed their entire butts i want mooreee
great having a superpower of time traveling while having a heart attack is making me angtsy sir dont go dying on ep 6 now
even though i caved in and got the viu sub since its kinda cheap i am very much distraught that theres like a hundred different platforms for bl couldnt boc have given this to iqiyi i thought they had a good thing going already 
oh there you are
no shade but were there a lot of rewrites because i cant imagine build playing any of these characters lmao

yes sammon and someone else said that it went through a lot of rewrites and isnt much like the original at all


hold on 8episodes only
pls tell me when i should blink
i realized that they focused on tonklas expressions more than korns in this whole scene no complaints cos i am thrilled it made me feel things but what could be the reason for this


to show his incredible eye contact and eye acting cause his eyes gave us an entire dialog into what he feels and thinks
okay it was so good 
my goodness there was a brief period during that nc scene i couldnt pick my jaw off the floor actually no my mouth was wide open pretty much throughout that whole scene and believe me i tried
i cant wait to see more 
we were all wrong dyingggg lol


all this ep i was like  oh my gawd bas
also waah the story looks promisingthe production looks top notch durex and the cat food marketing was subtle it was a good start
also that nc sceneive only seen that stuff in manga i need time to process it wow and glad to see bas and job here
i love the show sammon writing is still so cooland the first scene was sus jesbible knock outwhat
i dont care if its sadhappy or open ending  i was getting bored of romcoms with polished flowery ending anyways so i needed some spice hope its dark and makes my brain worki needed a thriller bl
so far kpaction and dffhorrorthriller have not disappointed me so i have more expectations for this showplotwise also i think bas character is grey  thymegreat by jesbible is nice too 
lets see how this goes
this is so fucking good  i knew i could trust boc on delivering highquality projects  the cinematography the plot the acting everything is phenomenal 

in my villain era
met at that 33 min mark i may not survive this series but baby what a way to go 
fujin
hey did you all catch the same thing i did so greats heart stopped at the start of the episode and now hes living his life again but with the power to see 4 minutes into the future so maybe he can save tyme from being murdered am i right am i right were getting a happy ending right r i g h t 

cherry magic 
thank you for the warnings and info about the release  its good to know this context  though im sad i dont know when and where ill watch this  

omg


cause of death the heart killers 
im living vicariously through all the gifs youre posting
i can do it with a broken heart
props to you uthoughtsallday for this very detailed but comprehensive overview this is not only dedication but also a massive public service announcement and i appreciate that very much
im pissed with bocs lack of professionalism here this is rookie level noncommunication and its well it doesnt look good
im also pissed with capitalism because even when theres clearly a massive following able and willing to spend money to watch this series legally it and the greedy folks at viu prevent us from doing just that having nice things
lmao
that was cinema everything was soo good what the fuck acting cinematography nc scenes music editing one episode in and it has majorly upstaged kinnporsche this is bananas we have one for the history books on our hands also the production value is at the level of basically any high budget american show which is crazy i didnt think wed ever really get there with bl damn boc just knows how to shake things up and how to bring it nobody else in the game is doing it like them right now

bocs cinematography
im trying to purchase a premium account and do you need to have a thai cc am i going to have to jump through another hoop to get some asian prepaid

the music the colourgrading the set the fucking smut why is it so good

yeah it is to the extent that i feel i dont deserve this


hey furry thing do you know how lucky you are  in the voice of vegas telling pete in kp  do you know how sexy you are 


 do we know if this lucky kitty is bibles real life kitty

four hundred comments in 24 hours is this what the kinnporsche onairs were like that was before my time lol



its actually making me really curious as to what the viewership numbers looks like like how many people saw the first ep bc going by the number of comments its at least as many if not more but i dont know how reliable that is as an indicator

for what its worth it was pretty simple for me to sign up with a vpn  i chose the ph option i just finished watching the first episode d




 bad guy bosskateer 
im sooooooo happy with how expensive bible is in this why do i love expensive mens i cannot afford them 


his wardrobe is absofuckinglutely exquisite and tells an entire story on its own

unfortunately the direct link doesnt work unless you have the vpn active and the premium viu membership

perfect 10 liners
of course i havent watched it because its not available for interfans
also how many boc boys  have i seen now and whatever they are spending on their workshop is totally worth the money 
the premise is very interesting the patient giving her experience was very foreshadowey but it might be just there to keep us guessing i look forward to not watching the next episode wink wink


also how many boc boys  have i seen now
hmmm keep em coming we are ready im never really ready but i practice so yeah

when youre all dressed up but realize you forgot your phone at home


i loved this scene


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
holy shit that nc scene made me scream like i had never screamed what was that
that was so hot i am vibrating


i was shook to the core



yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
someone pls come collect my mouth off the floor


my mouth is going on 24hrs and refuses to get off the floor so i cant come help you right now


great thats called a hit and run tsk tsk tsk i guess she was trying to commit  glad he stopped the second time though
i usually really hate medical shows but i always find myself hooked on whatever sammon writes  manner of death triage dff and now this side note i really want transplant  the triagemanner of death sequel
korn and tonkla and their softcore porn scene  korn clearly so far in the closet hes discovered narnia  poor tonkla i feel quite bad for him the black cat after korn left was kinda creepy
sitting at the opposite end of that massive table is so petty great clearly theres something going on between him and his dad bon appetit ka to you too 
oh so korn and great are step brothers i guess same dads different mums
really intrigued by greats powers  why does he have them where did they come from whats the lesson here number 4 being a recurring theme will mean something
its weird that he saw 4 minutes ahead and ended up not seeing manee like the first time it was to avoid killing her the second tike it was to  see him and doc have sex is he reliving his past because that clearly wasnt 4 minutes in the future
im sat im invested activating chokehold also ive just missed bible on my screen and i like that hes not a raging psychopath in this role sammon always gets me with her mystery element and this feels very sammon thank god this came when it did because ive been fighting for my life to find a bl thats got me hooked since unknown my stand in was really good though and tldhlb has me pretty invested


is he reliving his past because that clearly wasnt 4 minutes in the future
i think so too the opening scenes show us jes shot and a man with long black hair getting rescusitated with a big 4 on the wall above his head
the doc conducting interviews spoke to a lady that explained the 4 minutes situation while having a heart attack and when bible got off the elevator with his incredible low cut shirt he grasped his chest like when you have a heart attack and the other person said they could see themselves when having a heart attack so i think the whole series is what bible is feeling while being rescusitated as we saw in the opening sceneshe is reviewing his life reel while under this awake asleep state

half brothers not step
yup we are watching bibles past i wrote that fan theory if you pay attention to what other patients does the last woman describes it perfectly
overall what is happening is that bible is in hospital opening scene and doctor is trying to revive him through shocksso bible is relivingthinking of his past like a normal life without realizing his current true condition and living life normally and the only abnormal thing is 4 min in future
summary we are in bibles thoughtdream world 4 min into the future is actually his past his heart aches in elevator etc are linked to real life shocks he is getting from the machine and since this is dream world time does not flow well and that black cat  if you have seen matrix is the aberration
mind eventually will have to adjust between dream world and reality

i cant be the only one who was thinking thats a white couch the entire time they were fucking on it the stains


i got past that after analyzing the couch scene extensively from the trailer i was way past that by yesterday i did the homework lol

do i need a premium subscription to watch im searching for this at the app rn and i cant find it


you from any of these countries

you do need a premium subscription even for ep1 here is the direct link in case it helps


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
i need to watch this


me myself im taking this personally boc has made it clear to me that they dont give a if we cant watch 4 minute have viki iqiy and gagaoolala why should i have to use a vpn for something they dont want me to see if you knew you wasnt going to let it be viewed internationally why show me the polit sorry for the rant


i am quite disappointed i really wanted to support this series especially for bible i have subscriptions for iqiyi viki  gagaoolala i refuse to add another subscription just for one series it pains me but i will sit this one out and watch short clips about it instead 


100 agree im too old to be figuring out how to use a vpn just to pay for it plus another premium service im out the clips were something though so im glad folks shared


i thought since the fambiz is in logistics i was thinking smuggling arms dealingoh well offshore gaming online gambling works toothats millions in minuteseldest son was keeping his shock and surprise wellso other doc is doing research on this phenomenon the 4min future time distortion might be a brain tumorsolid first ep cant wait to unraveling this mystery


my guy how could you hit her again lol take another route gorgeous
intrigued by the plot honestly very disinterested in korn aside from his relationship with great i know people dont mind the age gap with tonkla but it made me uncomfortable and i didnt really enjoy how he and tonkla spoke to each other  it added to how juvenile he is im mildly curious about how they met i guess lol
mostly interested in whatever is going on with great and i like that his love interest is a doctor i feel like that will be fun to explore

point isnt that point is that unlike the future he took responsibility after hitting her


never have i been happier that i chose to watch the premiere of a show on my tablet because boy would that have been awkward on the living room tv
as for the rest of the show im curious as to why it seems that no one has told the police that the accident was intentional it should have been cleared up a while ago and great shouldnt have to take responsibility because it wasnt his fault
im also still very much on the fence about how much i trust sugar baby


when jes the doc picked up his phone after she confessed to both docs i totally thought he was calling the detectivecops to let them know what she said but nope he was just calling to get the or prepped and i was like omg someone call the cops cause what if she dies in surgery so then i was like ok well its good that she told both docs so there were two witnesses just in case she dies since jes will be a love interest they may not belive he is telling the truth later

he he that woman is dead what we are watching is bibles dreamthoughts and a what if scenario
brain is already overworked building the world and filling the story it had to weave entire individual backstories who cares about police d
not boc saying south korea  tba and it not being available upon release i knew this was gonna happen but come on


 i know and we are all upset about their terrible communication failuressetting that aside the fact they created this masterpiece of an ep1 truly is spectacular and i am completely ok with how they chose to stream assuming the money they got in exchange was what allowed them to make this masterpiece of an episode
i just wish they would have communicated clearly and honestly what they were doing

i knew it was boc and the quality was gonna be good as always but im still shocked everytime and yes i appreciate bc no one else is doing such amazing cinematography


oh this is good  not surprised though because boc knows how to produce acting plot and cinematography all on point i will be watching every saturday with my vpn im so excited to see the rest of the series 




earthmix 
jes is so soft i feel hes going to break my heart he kind of reminds me of a grown up first i think i need to rewatch again


i am on watch 5 and it has not worn off 
he reminded me of first too which made me look forward to seeing him in more mature roles


earthmix 


as far as i know no at least not legally 

this is so unfair i have been waiting for so long


i know  me too 


fujoshi
so sorry if im just slow to the up take they werent allowing us in the united states to watch or do we have to have something special to watch on


read the post for all the details 



ugh i have major fomo but i had to work today no time for hoop jumping i am jealous and will have to try tomorrow
ok it wasnt bad vpn to thailand and go to viucom is only the first ep free


i will try going on the straight and narrow next week i have no choice  this week


earthmix 


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
ive noticed that the thing i struggle with with thai bls is the first 15 or so minutes of the first episode when characters are being introduced i always get lost and lose interest so many a bl have been dropped for this reason honestly 4 minutes was no different i struggled to follow along in this ep and had to watch the first 40 minutes or so twice to understand wtf was going on it felt like i was introduced to too many people too soon and felt overwhelmed by it all i first watched the uncut version and the nc scene was completely cut off the scenes moved from tonkla saying hes not just good at talking to korn seated at the family table and so much was lost with this cut versionand i dont mean the nc scene the post nc scene where korn leaves in a rush and tonkla sees a black cat feels like important info that the audience should have anyway watching the cut version added to my confusion but after the second watch i get whats going on and i cant wait to see what happens next
the first shirt that great has on is everything i love seeing rich male characters who dont have to wear conventional suits dress up i get lots of fashion inspo from them
lastly what time did korn start his day bc how did he get a promotion go see the business that seems to be far from his dads office go see tonkla have sex w tonkla drive to family home and have dinner with his family all before 7pm and where did he get the energy for all this



lastly what time did korn start his day bc how did he get a promotion go see the business that seems to be far from his dads office go see tonkla have sex w tonkla drive to family home and have dinner with his family all before 7pm and where did he get the energy for all this
korns day is a typical day for me minus my meditation at 4am workout at 5am etc 

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
when cut versions cut more than just the nc scenes eg cooking crush its always a disaster how long was the cut version was that the only cut you noticed
wow best bl sex scene ever we got booty cheeks nipple play and actually realistic thrusting  love that they had the lube on hand lol fuaiz is sooooooooooo hot
im really excited about this series the premise is cool the acting is good and the writing seems really good i loved bible in kp i thought he was a great actor so im really looking forward to him in this




im back at ep1 do we see a ring on doc thyme at 46sec technically the future maybe uthebookhuntress uimomen



i was watching ep 3 and thinking to myself maybe ton klas bf didnt pick up the phone last episode because he knew 2 things already
that tk brother is gone
where the bodies are buried and the reason why he had known this was because hes the one who dumped the guy there after he got him killed but after those ep 2 and 3 endings i dont know what to say about dear doctor


i didnt think this about korn when he hung up on tk the first time he answered but hung up cause he was freaking out about the emergency at the gambling den
however when he saw all the missed calls i wondered and these thoughts crossed my mind but also he was dealing with a lot of chaos in his new important job and tk is not his boyfriend so he is not his priority he is his sugar baby and his well being is not his main concen and he wont make time for him he has a new important job and his fiancegirlfriend is his priority given her dad is the one getting him out of the pickle he got himself into
but you have very valid points and maybe you are completely right

my heart is overflowing with happiness and excitement  i finally get to watch one of my most anticipated shows without jumping through hoops i literally watched ep 1 and stopped because i couldnt bear all the nonsense surrounding streaming availability it really made it hard for me to enjoy the series
watching on a big screen makes a world of difference i was never ready for a close up of korns sexy bum and the way tonkla was semi parting it  firm  start to the series i loved ep 1 now onwards to ep 2 comment image


woohoo welcome

i can do it with a broken heart
so first thoughts on episode 1 yall can laugh at me great and korn are brothers yes great is the good poor little rich kid yeah korn is slowly being jaded by his familys secret dirty business everyone has secrets duh tonkla has some hes keeping from korn too tyme has little empathy for anyone let alone his patients hell probably learn that from great he clearly doesnt like working for the public hospital system  where his talents are possibly needed i thought the suicidal woman could be tonklas mother but probably not

i can do it with a broken heart
ahahahaha the dinner hes so over his family lol
i just love how everyone is always making a distinction between drugs alcohol and nicotine boy do i have news for you
tyme is so jaded he hates being poor eh
so my theory is great actually got into that accident when he hit that woman and he was hurt badly and all we see is an alternate reality ie what would have happened had he been able to see 4 minutes ahead im guessing the moral of the stories ultimately is about choices the ones we make and the ones we dont make and all the main characters are dead or near dead

it is just enraging i like many others im sure have been waiting and dying to see 4 minutes and of course its the oe straming site that isnt available i even left tweet on be on cloud twitter page honestly i wasnt expwcting them to answer its just frustrating

how can boc make something as great and exceptional as kinnporsche and then put their two heartthrobs in something as dull as man suang even jeff satur and barcode left the studio and they are two up and comers why would boc limit its audience on their latest release


where can i find this


hey which country do i need to chose to watch the uncut version i am having a hard time


soooooo at just after 3433 did any one else him ask is in it or out during the nc scene


just finished watching 4 minute sultrier version through vpn and i have no wordsgaggedi mean daddy chill

christ i was not ready for that
cinematography is amazing story line very compelling and the nc
what to say one of the most realistic looking i have ever seen even with the throwing away of the bottle of lube
fuaiz is completely blowing me away the way he uses his eyes no wonder the camera is focusing on his face
and me feeling especially old and creepy he turned 18 last january
bas is also killing it not only in the nc scene the thrusts
but also when he walks in that office and the relationship with his half brother
jes and bible they are great
8 episodes in total
that is not what im used too but with this high quality i dont complain


the nc scene is crazy but i just wanna know if fuaiz was at a legal age



so i feel really dumb i got vpn and was able to watch the 1st episode sultry edition no issues but now i cant watch the 2nd episode on vpn viu says content not available
for reference the vpn is express vpn and im connecting to hk both 1 and 2 with no luck
any help would be appreciated
edit apparently hk no longer works for sultrydirectors cut how i watched episode 1 on vpn viu wont load with thialand so i ended up trying the phillipines and that works hopefully this wont be a round robin guessing game each week for the episodes

lol this might be the first time i will willingly watch a censored version
in my head nc scenes like this fit more to a trashy series but 4 minutes seems to really put emphasis on the story and shots and overall cinematography to the extent that the nc scene is just taking me out of the story xd
so far really nice start


what okwell yes i guess it may not be for everyonethis is so cute im screaming boc really knows how to balance insane plotdrama and cute romantical stuff like this so so well 


bocs cinematography
he was immediately like omg hot guy hot guy hot guy hot guy

i thought he was leaving but no he just wanted to get himself together for boyfie



please so many people on twitter are like omg tyme is a traitor and im like hes checking his hair and flexing in the mirror hes not just after info  i loved it so much especially when hed go from suave and hitting on great to obviously inwardly facepalming at himself


i may sound stupid but what info does tyme need from great have i missed something

what imomen said  basically it implies that tyme has ulterior motives for approaching great we saw him pause when he saw the card on the flowers which possibly means that he recognized his name but just because he has another motive doesnt mean that he cant also be motivated by finding great hotadorable af
at the end of todays episode its revealed that tyme is up to something with the curly haired woman that works at korns online gambling outfit we see her walk up and gave tyme a flash drive b4 it goes off 


damn that was tyme i have poor eyesight  i was excited to get a new hottie but

i love this nurse 


bocs cinematography
queen anne is everything

she was the extra lady on the trainee who kept getting the interns in trouble 
also saw her in ep 1 of knock knock boys as a professor
ive noticed her a lot lately like slay queen get the bag 

these big boys w real world jobs falling for these oblivious college boys is so cute and hilarious 


adorable 

so cute 
shia what the fu
bible going from swearing in thai to swearing in english is so iconic 


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
when tyme is about to examine him i noticed that he says ummm in english then goes to thai

that whole scene was so fun and hilarious and was giving me manhwa vibes so bad like a lot of bls try to capture the manhwa vibes that japanese bl specifically does so well but few thai bl can do it as well as boc lol
yeah i noticed that too lol

screaming


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
the way he got in between those legs so nonchalantly
doc realising he was being too transparent too early 


reel it in doc too obvious you are not a good actor buddy you are a surgeon he is gonna figure out you are sus also as a surgeon maybe punching faces and damaging your hands is not advisable

types olive oil stained broken hip
im glad he used his hands though that dude deserved it


yes dont mess up bibles immaculate face dude
still screaming


this part killed me like where are your eyes going sir


i screamed very loudly here

theyve barely met and i can tell wins already seduced lol


bocs cinematography
theres no more romantic place than the morgue while he prettily cries over the corpse of his brother
look they dont have to put my love life on blast like this


funeral hookups are a thing its how some guys confront their own mortality and sad boners

literally happened in the pornographer mood indigo  that was a wild scene

so thats why jj had the pornstache to look like an older cop guy i still want to shave it off though 

yeah its not a good look and makes him look like hes trying way too hard to look older on purpose lol 

im so confused
but doc hottie stepping between greats legs to examine him like that er was oozing from the sexual tension lol
the inspector stache and tonkla ship is starting its journey and im on board 

that er was oozing from the sexual tension lol
oozing what tho 

lol you choose imma say gay pheromones


but doc hottie stepping between greats legs to examine him like that er was oozing from the sexual tension lol
this was my ep 2 highlight

title rolling up to great like can you help me hide a bodyyyy  like its a casual friday evening
this is so good so far its definitely going to be a series i rewatch to analyze all the juicy bits


title rolling up to great like can you help me hide a bodyyyy  like its a casual friday evening
i said outloud oh i am definitely not a ride or diei may help but explain the situation first 

bas you better werq bitch 


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
well i guess thats what i missed in the cut version

same but looking at it i cant shake the feeling the actress had a good laugh i always remember emilia clarke talking about scenes with jason it was big pink and fluffy xd he wore a cute sock apparently



i was not expecting to see a cfnm scene that is a very niche kink
are they related or did korn just call her dad uncle out of respect it would be super weird if they are actual cousins by blood

hot 

jes is both cute and handsome dashing but in an understated way
wait so whos dead


bocs cinematography
mannn this is going to be dff all over again where we can go back and watch the episodes after we have more knowledge and see all the clues in hindsight

sammon stays saying bitch you thought to us 
dr flex 


he is such a cute undercover wannabe falling for his victim lol


with his serious face it took a full minute before i realised what he was trying to do 

hot cop jjay omg


his heart eyes later did me in 

and it was so immediate i was hollering lol

also why do i have a feeling that the son of the lady in the hospital who commited sicide is smh important for the story and will appear at some point she mentioned him so many times to the doc and great was he working at the gambling business to pay off his debt 
i got my cherry pepsi slushy and a bucket of chips its almost 9am here im ready 2 go


how do i get that chair

temu but results may vary


now im super curious about what generic nat chen would look like 

there you are white  i meant tonkla


he is so freaking pretty 


quick psa last week i watched by accident the not so sultry version and then watched again the sultrier version after i figured out i had the wrong vpn anyways the sultrier version also has other scenes not nc that are cut from the other version for instance there was a scene where great and korn talk after the dinner at their parents that was cut from the shorter version i found that overall the sultrier version gave more context to the story and of course the great nc scene

thank you for the warning thats really good to know


yes as mentioned on the post there are different versions of the series in each country not just ncs are removed  viu mentioned this in their post


bocs cinematography
jet playing a character who isnt a total shithead challenge failed id love to see him being someone nice sometime his face is so expressive and interesting to look at that id love to watch him and not want to chuck boiling water in it i was hoping wed get some jetmio action guess not
i was scared there for a second that we were going to get a hetero sex scene hetero gross but fasai is really pretty that thigh shot though
so korn probably knew about the gambling all along and was lying
them not showing tongklas brothers face interesting my theory is that we saw tongkla in the future in the cold opening i think that he was killing who killed his brother in the place where it happened also the fact that it deliberately didnt show us his brothers face is that his brother is maybe tyme or den or someone that weve seen already i think he was killing korn or he was killing his brother and all of this is an act
tyme being all flustered about seeing great again was adorable checking his muscles and tucking his shirt in and seeing bible all nervous when tyme slotted himself between greats legs to check his wound was cute since bible has such a cool aura
tyme and win being instant simps on the job loser icons
so why is a doctor interested in closing illegal gambling dens are the timelines all out of order
poor tongkla you could tell he was just carved out i hope its not all an act and hes just a liar who murdered his brother but the fact that korn just completely forgot about him in his time of need  i mean i get that you were busy because you fucked up your illegal gambling house but you dont have to be an asshole about it  and he just lost his brother and knows that no justice will come of it thats a person who will do anything because they have nothing left to lose
vip this episode is anne i love how shes just trying to blow up tymes rizz him yanking greats chart away from her was hilarious

are the timelines all out of order
thats how it feels like atm like were only getting bits and pieces and it all will come together at the end low key loving that concept but also hating it cause im constantly confused lol


i think the opening scenes are in the future
the thing that keeps frustrating me is that i keep trying to figure out the disconnects and then going wait no because i remember something that connects it the only thing i feel like could be possible is that korn and tonklas timeline is before everything that happens with great


bocs cinematography
see i thought it was after i imagine by episode 8 our brains will be exploding just like with dff

fujin
from that woman who had a heart attack in the first episode i think were dealing with two different timelines in the first one great almost dies and cant save tyme who started investigating all the gambling stuff maybe because of the suicidal womans son  i dont know in the second one great gets the power to see the future to fix everything he did wrong and repeats because his heart stopped and you get that kind of power  i dont know like if you reach your thirties and youre still a virgin you get to read peoples minds lol
i want to know how much delusion im working with here but this is my take

great theories though tyme is interested only because he knows he is a brother and part of the mafia family he made sure to mention he knew his name
tongkla being the actual killer is possible i havent thought about it

woahyou just called hetero nc scene grossso unoriginali wouldnt like to see a hetero one eitherbut i wont say its gross 


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
way more questions than answers for me from this one i had to watch the cut version which is 3 minutes shorter than the sultrier version so i dont know what i missed
im not sure who died tonklas dead brother was referred to as nongchai or younger brother dome doesnt look like hed be younger title either but he sure is a dick isnt he just like top in dff
im loving tyme so far kind of cold on the outside but soft and sensitive on the inside jes is very impressive and he gets hotter to my eyes with every scene
baskorn looks a lot like milekinn same hair same styling i dont imagine thats 100 coincidence
i hope we get an akuma cameo every episode
bible continues to slay that is all
off to watch it again
arghhhhh not again with these previews


i could watch those all day every day keep throwing them in every episode please

and thats ton in the beginning so what he had beef w title and saw him lying there and finished the job 


bocs cinematography
i think this might be in the future there is more blood on that rock than in the beginning i think he might be killing his brothers killer or maybe he killed his brother and is lying

ahh yes good point this show is really fking w mee 


i think the beginning scenes are in the future but they tie them in so good they showed us tonkla smoking exactly like this later in the episode to tie him back to this person we are not supposed be able to recognize but like fuaizs eyes gave him away immediately i gotta go back and watch but do we know for sure he is killing title
i mean the police investigation definitely could tie title to tonklaa bro death due to circumstantial evidence since they were there together but what if they are throwing us off cause that rage could be directed at korn rage like that often happens when love goes wrong and you find out he had something to do with your brothers death


bocs cinematography
crazy theory time
so the stuff with tongklakornwin is all in the future and not the same timeline that were seeing with great so for some reason that will be revealed later jes is trying to close down korns gambling den maybe because he is tongklas brother and knows about his involvement with korn tyme was the person in the body bag and tongkla kills korn in retribution so great has to come back to change this past so tyme doesnt die
this will get holes poked in it in an instant but im just throwing it out there
edit or tyme is using great as an in to take down this company tyme falls in love with great but gets killed for it  tongkla kills korn


the only thing is im pretty sure tongkla calls his brother nong not phi when hes crying over him so if thyme did die hed have to be the younger brother which im not sure i buy lol

yes i was thinking the samethe brother that died must be someone we already saw i was thinking tyme as wellaand that connects with the first scene of the first episode when tyme was being shoot at it was him right
maybe they are brothers that dont live together and are doing this ton with korn and now tyme with great  to avenge their parents or something maybe they worked at the gambling farm and got killed for it or something  nobody can know tyme and ton are brotherthus the disconnect btw the houses tyme does seem very insistent in pursing great it looks cute but it has more to it
what do we know for sure it cant be korn nor great
if it is in the futureit could be anyone else but tyme makes sense could be too close to dff though i havent watched it all but i know the reveal at the end was connected to brothers
i dont like thisthe show is so well made but its going to be one of those too close to reality give me the same quality but with some fluff and just a bit of conflict to make it interestingi have a feeling everyone is dead already or going to


bocs cinematography
fun fact before the episode starts  people who have had near death experiences and diedcame back often report that they have issues wearing watches or with technology because the electromagnetism in their body is all wiggidy schwiggidy the scientific term of course
cutie mio finally 


perfect 10 liners
jes is so hot and after seeing countless vegas edits over the years its still a bit weird seeing shy bible but hes so cute all flustered and shy
and are the officer and the twink endgame because i would be ok with that


shy bible is everything i didnt know i needed

what the fuck happened at this ep too much have been going on hahahaha
and the tension between tyme and great 
girl 

im fuckin tripping everytime jes is talking i can hear first from gmmtv im crazy they have the same tone of voice
doc basically throwing himself at great lol
for a moment i thought title was dead the little bitch is still alive
who is tonklas brother wait did tonkla killed his brother cause the intro was him rocking someone to deathh
korn u bitch
so we are gettin jjayfuaiz after all
ok so doc is behing the hackin


earthmix 


that was me i was like wait title is tons brother and he killed his brother and now pretending to mourn him but then he appeared at greats

i dont even know where to begin that was a bit of a mindfuck of an ep even though there wasnt any actual fucking donekinda lame imo
it was confusing they jampacked so many things all i know is these so called professionals the cop and the doctor acting really sus and horny nurse you better clock him might just be a green case but flexing while patients literally bleeding comment image

earthmix 
i cant be the only one who tried scanning his line id 

vpn loading in 321

i love the mystery i love it when the show doesnt hold your hand but lets you figure out things throughout the show i just hope it will make sense at the end 
i dont even care if its a bl show still would watch it as a straight one
i am soooo intrigued by the timeline here and whats going on because we know that were seeing things out of order its just a matter of piecing it all together
thoughts
something i loved about this episode is the way that they put in fluff and comedy it can be difficult to do that with a show thats focused on action and intrigue but they managed here and it is top tier also can we pause for a moment to reflect on the fact that it seems like great is seeing himself have sex with tyme before it happens like of course the boy is having gay panic and then im wondering if hes had sex before or not and whether hes been with a man before or not
i have a lot of sympathy for korn in this episode he had this job dropped on him and didnt want him but he obviously wants to do well at it and to make his father happy it doesnt surprise me that hes feeling stress over it and is getting tense especially when he makes a monumental screwup our sympathies are with tonkla because we know whats going on with him but korn doesnt also damn that scene with fasai was everything and ive now seen more of bas butt in the last two weeks than i have in the last two years lmao
i saw someone else say that they were hoping for jetmio but i am actually so relieved that didnt happen we have enough going on without adding in another couple title is a grade a asshole and has me questioning how and why great came to be friends with him tbh
i am so curious about the connections here we have the woman in the hospital who lost her son and we know something happened to korns mother we know that something happened to tonklas brother but we dont know who is brother is for sure yet and we know that tyme gets shot and that tonkla kills someone but we dont know what goes down there weve been told that things in the show are happening out of order and that people may not know what time theyre in etc so my brain is going about fifty miles a minute trying to figure all of this out lol about the only thing that seems to be linear so far is great hitting the woman  taking her flowers  seeing tyme  then seeing him later but we also showed a snippet last week that seemed to be of the woman still dying so whats happening here i feel like i need to go back and rewatch to get a better idea of what the possible timeline could be but it could also be that we just dont have enough info yet
it feels like tonklas storyline is definitely happening at a different time but the question is  when is it possible that it happened earlier the woman mentioned her son being greats age so i feel like that means that its either title dome or tonkla with i guess title or dome being more likely since tonkla has a brother 


the woman mentioned her son being greats age so i feel like that means that its either title dome or tonkla with i guess title or dome being more likely since tonkla has a brother 
cant be title cause title has money and an influential father
she said her son tried to make money but lost all of it what if her son was a gambler or part of the gambling business

omg its only the second episode but i can already tell these series are gonna be one of my most favorite  literally everything is so great its feels like watching a high quality western movies
and can we appreciate jess acting i knew he was an actor in the industry for a long time but this is my first time watching him on screen his portrayal of all the tiniest emotions is just so spot on  and his and bibles chemistry is definitely chemistrying 


hopefully we got another nc scene to this week


lol yall still havent figured out boc logic they do not do a lot of nc they do 12 nc make it so good and thats it now focus on the plot they say 

well that would be ideal but boc typically spreads them out and doesnt usually do one in every episode but lets hope thats changed here 

bocs cinematography
and hopefully its also 4 minutes long again
right now my main theory and im always wrong is great is creating alternate timelines and in one of them dome dies and were seeing the result of the timeline where great doesnt change anything
so my theory is dome is tongklas brother but again im always wrong lol

captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
is that fuaiz at the beginning of the episode with the rock
with every scene jes appears in i find him more and more attractive i thought bible would be the one id have my eyes on but jes quiet charm has me hooked
tyme falling for great and trying to act cool while anne side eyes him was the best thing that happened in this episode
every day i am so grateful i decided to get a vpn subscription

 already because every time i was like oh ok thats whats going onnope never mind lol i for one love a good plot heavy series and even if i dont get it nowand i mean these timelines what i love all the little twists
poor tonkla hes going through it but like i also knew my boy wasnt that innocent didnt expect a full on murder though and korn honey get it together like it did not take long at for him to screw things up so much for tons little pep talk  pep sex combo 
nurse anne clock him sis tyme trying to act like he didnt care was cute im sure he has ulterior motives but i mean its bible he said might as well get me a good time to
i also just need great to keep better company because sir who is talking about i know something fun we can do murder  his initial reaction was not big enough for me it would have been an immediate nope as soon as he said he had his girl locked up police


i also just need great to keep better company because sir who is talking about i know something fun we can do murder  his initial reaction was not big enough for me it would have been an immediate nope as soon as he said he had his girl locked up police
this when he mentioned the locked up girl i was like what do you mean oh ok

im so confused but im sure by the end i will understand all of it lol


yeah i dare not say this but it makes no sense to me im just here to see jes and bible


i ran away from work to watch this the acting writing duh directing and cinematography are all very well done thats all i came to say gbye




i am so confused but i love it sm
like i know that tonkla is def the person at the beginning was it him that killed his brother and lied about it cuz if not he killed his brothers killer it would be damn weird for the police to let that same rock remain at that place after a freaking person already died because of it so either tonkla is a mastermind liar and actor lets go bitcvh or this is a wonky time episode with time travelingleaps and shi i hated inception so istg
and for the brother himself maybe tonklas brother is the accident ladys son cuz tonkla was like why did it have to be you cuz maybe both of them were struggling for money but his little brother was struggling more this one im kinda not sure about cuz a lot of things wouldnt add up
another theory about the brother cuz bro is making me mad like who r u man is that maybe the person who dome was talking to near the lockers seemed kinda romantic was tonklas younger brother and bc he promised to meet up tonklas brother went looking for dome and thats why he ended up at that place where something happened if this were to be true im gonna assume that he didnt get oomphed by the rock and it was same place but different timing and circumstances the rock that win found was from titles whole tantrum thing not tonklas brothers thing
but honestly whats most likely gonna happen is that they will reveal these things to be a couplefew different timelines this is mainly because 1 this whole series is about time 2 the place with the light tower thingie came up like 3 times this probably means that a bunch of things happened there but different ways i would bet that greats power allows him to also jump to different timelines not just see 4 minutes into the future
okay so last thing im actually so happy that fuaiz is getting a bigger role and i hope he has a lot to do with the plot also bro be pulling like crazyyyy i gotta get in line fr


so korn is everybodys bitch and we get to see his gorgeous behind againdr tyme so cute trying to lowkey flirt with greatdoc up your game i think it just went over greats headfuaiz is crying againdont worry too much inspector stache jjay is doing a house call at nightso definitely lady nest hair at the offsite gambling is a spyeverything ties up with the gamblingthere are those who want to shut it down and there are those out for revenge for lives destroyed and lostinteresting to see how will great navigate this with his 4minute superpower



writing this before reading any other comments so i may be completely wrong only watched it once
this is sooooo freaking good
ok dying to see the photo tonkla was holding of his brother  who is his bro i dont think he is the shareholder that fahs dad had killed off the guy with the unbrella in theflashback cause if tonklas bro was rich enough to be a shareholder tonkla wouldnt need korns money
so guessing tonklas bro maybe was the hacker but at the end maybe the girl from the gambling place with the usb drive was the hacker
did she really give the usb to doc tyme at the end  i have no idea i didnt have time to rewind or record or rewatch ugh it looked like him though and he was dressed all in black and he obviously seemed to know great at the hospital and great had the hot af  flashbacks or flashforwards so it seems like doc tyme definitely knows great from before and not just from the papers flying
unless the doc and the police officers are just falling in lust immediately and instantly with great and tonkla respectively  when doc tyme was moving inbetween greats legs to stitch him up their chemistry was suffocating me omfggggg 
title is a dick with a well connected dad since he offered great his dads help if anything went wrong with the lady great hit with his car last week
titles location for the murder plot maybe coincidentally is the same place where fahs dad had the shareholder andor the hacker murdered maybe its the go to place to make someone disappear my city has a place like that so its possible it is just a coincidence and ofcourse the rock will tie the two crimes together and probably get great into trouble
the way doc tyme was randomly in that car elevator parking and aggressively tried to get greats line id is sus  unless we consider greatbible is fine af and i could totally believe doc was just hot for him  but if we are analyzing plot doc tyme has an anterior motive probably
bas completely nude another week in a row and i am not mad the slurping  sound though when he was eating fah out though was not as hot as when he moaned with tonkla last week ngl 
tonkla last week was definitely stressed out and hiding something from korn when korn arrived last week was it just the drugs empty baggie from today or was tonkla in cahoots with his bro to screw over korn
or is tonklas bros death unrelated and just there to throw us off like title and view tried to throw us off 
update
after thinking more about todays episode here is my current theory on great


bocs cinematography
one thing about tongkla last week too is i noticed that he very deliberately unbuttoned his shirt more while korn wasnt looking he might be playing him

i dont think tonkla was hiding anything shady from korn he was just hiding his cigarette box and lighter bcs korn hates smoking as established last week

ok i went back to try to figure this out and its a hot mess in my mind so dff was exhausting i dont like exhausting


im exhausted my brain is exhausted but also i want to rewatch ep1 for a 5th time and ep2 for a 2nd time tomorrow 

why did pkorn do that i loved him he cheated  i cant express how i feel rn


sadly we knew this from ep1 korn is cheating on that girl fah with tonkla when he spoke with his dad from tonklas place before they finished round 2 he told his dad he was with fah his girlfriendfiance tonkla is just korns sugar baby

this series is already gonna be iconic omg the twists they keep pulling i never know wtf to expect next
the camera shots cinematography the editing music sound editing everything is  immaculate
i was shocked from the first second of this ep onward expectations are irrelevant bc you cant predict anything
i knew fuaizs character was going to meet jjs but holy fck the way they met and we still didnt see who his brother was i knew korn was just using him as like a sugar baby situation but wow we got bas booty again 
jes is gorgeous and so hot in the all black outfit like boi i saw you primping in the mirror bro dont even lie you were tryna hit  like no gimme the chart  ill stitch it up myself 
im digging jes  bible so far
i cant believe great was friends with title like he is a rich scumbag i wonder who his father is i thought maybe the uncle but idk
the plot threads and threading 


i already really enjoyed episode 1 but episode 2 was so much fun and brought so much confusion bible and jes chemistry is top notch the looks especially jes has me blushing so curious what is happening and where things will go


bible and jes chemistry is top notch
it is palpable


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
bro greats friend is super dangerous




fck
this series omg holy sht my head is a mess i wonder who tonkla brother was i thought it was title but then he appeared again like wtf omg
and now also tonkla please make korn a cuckold please i command you sir the bastard deserves it
do it with mr hot policeman win please i want it haha d

wait so i had no trouble accessing the full subbed version of ep 1 last week w my vpn but now i an only get the first 3 minutes wout subs of ep 2 is ep 1 free for anyone but after that you have to have a viu subscription or are the eps getting released later for nonsubscribers

i live in those countries where the series is available on viu but yeah i got cut off too after the first 3 minutes and it says i have to subscribe i wonder how those in europe and the us will be able to watch the full episode

you have to subscribe to watch only ep1 was available for free per vius announcement
babieeee that 41 annual subscription is worth every penny


for vpn users what country are you using i uaed hk last week and it was fine now its not working at all weirdly enough i tried sg but it asked me to upgrade to premium but im already a premium user


i have the same issue used hk vpn last week and it was all good this week they only have the cut version and my subscription doesnt work on thai viu 

bocs cinematography
i use thailand


im using thailand

earthmix 

did not read the spoilers but i forgot episode two is out today im currently watching two worlds though 

what country are people using to get the uncensored episodes


so hk had the uncensored for ep1 but people are reporting that ep2 in hk is censored people are also saying that singapore has censored so no nc and also some scenes are removed even if not nc
most are able to access both versions cut and uncut through thailand and philippines so far

am i the only one who is scared we wont be having a happy ending i fear not all of our favs are making out alive


i came into this knowing there absolutely will not be a happy ending unfortunately 

after dff im just assuming everyone is dying lol i mean to me dff had an open ending but by no means was it happy


im really liking how the actor plays tyme the comedic timing is so cute and funny to me kinda realistic even haha i first wanted to see more vegas characteristics but getting into great bible is doing well just wished his character wasnt a student tonklas character is interesting then idc about the other side characters lol


tyme cand also see in the future like great


as far as we know no but tyme seems to have ulterior motives for getting close to great so he is trying to get greats phone number as part of his plan with the gambling site


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
just gimme a second im gonna watch this im so excited


okay so episode 2
poor great is having an absolute time of it hes going to need therapy after all of this shit
what does dr thyme want from great he seems way too invested this early
oh so korn decided to strip and go down on fasai then whilst also ignoring his boyfriend whos unidentified brother was just found dead in the very same place korns own brother was the night before with his friend title who might actually he a psychopath i dont think i like korn anymore
i get this feeling that all of these seemingly individual stories are going to link up at some point like a jigsaw puzzle and well all collectively be like omg that makes so much sense now unidentified brother korn living 2 different lives dr thymes motives the woman who tried to commit whos still getting scenes  backstory of her son who committed so clearly she andor he is important title being a psycho and of course great and why tf hes seeing 4 minutes ahead  so many storylines to follow
already love the biblexjes chemistry i reckon it will grow more as the show progresses just hope its not a tragic ending


just for clarity as we found out last week korn was cheating on this woman who is his girlfriendfiance with tonkla his sugar baby last week


queen sammon the plot is interesting
i think dr thyme was the one that hired hacker and also saved great either he can look into the future or is investigating greats fam for revenge i dont know
so korn is a two timing prick has rich fianc connections i think his character is eye catching cant wait for more also bas naked scene lmaoi saw his butt for 2 eps lol
dome is the nice guyi almost shipped titledome lol
title is a violent person with murder tendencies i think hell harm great again
so its official jjfaiz is back in this series i guessi guess kongkla will cheat on korn vice versa and unites with his police lover also the first scene did kongkla kill someone did he kill his brother with rock or acting innocent i need to rewatch this scene im a little confused so kongkla is not so innocent huh he smoked and killed his bro
thymegreat are growing on me thyme is a complex character i cant understand his intentions im loving this show boc never fails to awe me with a good bl thriller

i think this series is going to be too gloomy and jarring for me
ive noticed that as soon as a character acquires super powers death and destruction follow them everywhere great seems to be strangely disconnected from life and this new power of his is forcing him to step forward


gloomy
this is the brand of this series it most definitely is not a happy situation



im really enjoying it this bl has so much potential  boc youve done it again 


i havent watched epsiode 2 yet cause its too good

mind if i ask did they show the full sex scene of jesbible in the uncensored version of ep 2 during one of bibles futuresights

and is the uncensored version of ep 2 only 47 minutes long or did i just watched the censored one

they didnt show the full one but a lot of parts from the main one that we should be getting in ep4

i still dont get tle is still alive who tf died in that lighthouse area




help with what wow whats wrong with title no friendship is worth jail time


right
i can do it with a broken heart
thoughts about episode 2
title is the bad bad friend with bad influence who uses great for clout and protection because his family is either linked or more powerful he also probably killed view and did something to dome
ahahaha fuuuuuuuuuuck

i can do it with a broken heart
muhahahah tyme is so whipped for great who might accidentally have killed is trigger happy friend title
ahahaha i repeat my fuuuuck from earlier so tonkla and title are brothers well shit
huh so mor tyme was there to break up with his gf right but why was title there so somebody else coincidentally died on the same spot whaaat lol im so confused
the curly haired woman in the casino is either a mole a reporter or an undercover cop right
eeeh hows mor tyme involved in the casino business wtf

title actually has the connections and offers help to great over the car accident situation

wait thats dr jes right


it is so refreshing to watch actors that know how to act all of these guys are acting downnn like fuaiz is just 18 my goodness shoutout to boc

fujin
they made me love and hate korn so quickly that im a mess this show is absolute fire yall im still frustrated that something with so much potential is only being shown in a few countries bible jes and the rest of the cast deserve so much more and this could have been something praised outside bl productions

i completely agree with you


this show is too good its so painful waiting for every new episode

not so related but to me the actor fuaiz thanawat looks like this another actor named tai thanaphat not part of 4 minutes does anyone see the similarities between these two or am i tripping


one thing i really do enjoy in this show is that it seems like greats default language is not thai which is like bible and its fun lol


i am so angry with korn  tonkla deserves sooo much better he needs to get with the cop immediately


has anyone in canada figured out how to subscribe to viu premium i can vpn to viucom just fine but the site wont accept my canadian bank credit card for payment
do they hate money seriously its baffling


the way after finishing this ep i have more questions than before lmaooo i love this show


i guess boc doesnt care about the us global fans oh well there are plenty of other bls to watch that do care about the global fans  


context

guys i tried to post a pic of bass ass but it was deleted
i am too stressed out to watch out of context incoherent bls
theres no sex in this ep i might lose interest


i mean its sammonboc theyre more plot focused if you just want the nc scenes then you could probably just wait for spoilers and watch based on that because we probably wont get a ton like even kp only had 4 and that was spread out across 12 episodes and dff had 3 iirc


im just here for bible and the doc hopefully they both live but if not just would like to see the full nc scene p i figure someone will put up a nice diagram once we get there to explain it all just like the horror one i never understood 

types olive oil stained broken hip
post it in chati need a good reminder


just korn fully nude slurping  as he eats out ms fah
[deleted]


two things for one of which im going to be crucified
my friend and i used to classify good looking men into three types knitting pattern shaving advert and gay porn jes and bible have completed their journey to arrive at the pinnacle of hotness
at the risk of getting slaughtered so far guys i dont think the show is very good great production values yes but its all confusing as hell and the writing is just awful ill still visit from time to time for the hot men but a masterclass in storytelling it aint maybe things will change
im going back to bed now bye


why do you think the writing is awful i dont think you gave enough detail lol like yes its confusing but its also meant to be at this stage of the game


how is it awful the multiple timelines are being connected flawlessly they are providing clues every step of the way
but yes it may require analyzing and rewatching and that kind of active watching i do understand is not for everyonehelp 

its just a hand touch but
he is so gone omg a mess lol


we have lost another solider so sooon
fuck me raw im on prep
bitch 


ive just seen that durex is one of their sponsorsso i guess we will never see a raw fck in this series 


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
and we are grateful because we need more sex scenes where condoms and lube are shown

at some point i hope this poor boy gets some raw

tbh

screaming


bocs cinematography
grumpy work husband

i love their franship also i hope den gets some too job is too big and hot to be wearing so much clothes all the time


ok but bibles smile here literally made me scream so loud

bible is the cat lady of bl actors he must have all the cats especially the stuffed ones lol


lmfaooo the cut after this had me cracking tf up for 45 sec straight lol

i was dead and in heaven for 4 minutes straight 


im  omfg fuiaz  daaaaamn
also not forgetting bible fuck he is great at acting i mean i believe hes a rich lonely student and not a raging sadist sociopath  even with the lighter he seemed more dreamy 
uhhh the plot thickens 


even with the lighter he seemed more dreamy 
his face and his eyes here were a direct contrast to vegas doing the same exact thing bible is absofuckinglutely incredible with his craft
when i tell you that i screamed
were only 3 episodes in but fuaiz has truly been the breakout star of this show so far the range of emotions he has displayed in a span of 3 eps has been remarkable
i feel like boc is setting him and jjay up as the next big couple for the company more than tacopper at this point


i heard copper is going abroad to study so that ship is gonna be on the dl for a while

i was dying for fuaiz to get to flex a bit more in dff so im living for this and people seeing his potential and im glad that boc is pushing them a bit more since copper is going to be away so they cant do anything with tacopper in the meantime

and screaming


the lip pulll
tons finally in control 


this was so empowing for him and for us 


bocs cinematography
i love a power bottom so much
oh
my
god

literal soft corn atp and im not complaining


bocs cinematography
soft corn and soft korn because hes having to deal with his stupid casino and girlfriend while his boyfriend is getting fucked like he deserves

yeah no pity for that one

lmao poor bb jjay im screaming


bocs cinematography
the jizz on his chest i love the realism

i was very  at that scene hahaha has any other bl ever shown something like that props for realism but i was kinda floored lmao


cause of death the heart killers 
thisnis the comment i was looking for god this is the attention to detail we deserve 

the little chest pat had me on the floor  give him a kiss hes so down bad for you

its little things like win fixing tons hair that gives a scene like this so much added depth and weight it had me gasping 

yeah same

the way i screamed boy if u dont kiss that man u fxk initiated it

the way wins fixing tons hair help

so cute
cute 


the way great is the greatest there ever was 

the way bible can go from cutest dork ever to homicidal manic to walking sex w a fat ass is a gift the actor he is
was not expecting tonkla and copjj to hook up so quickly
also not expecting dr tyme to reveal himself to great already
the time changing is also sus dome woke up but we still have no info from him and title is still running around free

my theory is that when the time hits 1104 its going to reset and great will be brought back to exam day to fix whatever mess happens before then

this is what people mean when they talk about studying the bible i think 


bocs cinematography
i maybe wouldnt have been an atheist if i knew the bible had this much cake

and unto them he turned water to wine and there was cake for all
cakerinthians 4 i think

dr tyme must have the confidence of a god because great is rich as fuuuuuck that car is ridiculous lol


i dont know if its confidence or the drive to get to korn thru his hot af little bro 

lmao oh my fucking gawd the music is so kvnt 


the music this entire episode was outrageously good end credits show boc hired a third party company for all of it money well spent 

that scene was finger licking good can only be topped by tymegreat 
this is so tragic and cute im scared 
aww
gagged him a bit for sure 

not recognizing him even with the mask who are they trying to fool here


he totally recognized him in the hallway when he looked into his eyes but then said there is no way my new boo is trying to kill my bro
uimomen if you slow down the part where they lock eyes in the hallway you will see it 
fuaiz better be getting that baggg with all these nc scenes like dayumm  also let the man fck raw goddamn


bocs cinematography
he is acting his ass off literally and figuratively
hes my underdog fav character atp cause i feel like i know nothing about him besides that he really wants to be fcked raw hes a mystery  talking about tonkla ofc

the man is sad and just wanna be dicked down i respect that

yeah he deserves to get what he wants 


bro the special thanks to durex in the credits


which tells us tonkla sadly will likely not ever get his wish granted in this series at least 
damn it grandma 

boc still has their thing for having a random person taking out the trash be a complete cockblocker lol

the hair help 

i had to turn up the gamma on my monitor to be able to see this lmao

captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
so someone had mentioned way before the show began that apparently it takes 4 minutes for a person to die when their heart stops beating so if great is in the midst of a heart attack and his heart stopped beating at 1100 and 2 minutes have passed does that mean he has 2 more minutes left to live in some timeline that affects all the others if thats the case he doesnt have much time left and hes nowhere near getting his and our questions answered 
inspector wintonkla sex scene was everything i enjoyed it so much more than i did when tonkla was with korn maybe its because i like angst and sad boys but their scene was more meaningful to me tonkla being a sad boy and taking advantage of wins feelings and using sex to feel something is so real in contrast to the sex he has with korn tonkla demands to be pleased by win instead of receiving whatever is offered to him also it looks like hes the only one that cums when he has sex with win totally living for him being a power bottom
cant wait for great and tymes scene next week
omg 


crack the gate crack the ass
the parallels here fire i eyes wide focused doc tyme with a soft expression that shows a sweet contemplation so much emotional weight good lord
i feel a pall of doom hanging over the whole plot so i cant get emotionally involved with the characters because i dont want to be dragged down to hell with them

i feel you the way tyme looks at great especially is more than just attraction even in their most casual encounters
literally lmao
i had to mark the thread nsfw thanks to someone whos a happy gif maker sharing happy gifs all over the comments lol
they are really making us wait for that first kiss huh


but we get a claw machine 

ep4 will likely in my dreams at least include the kiss and all of it at once


bocs cinematography
angry fuiaz power bottom fuiaz nihilistic fuiaz we got so much range from him today where does boc find these incredible actors maybe someday hell get his wish to be fucked raw  give it time win actually likes you and i love that we got another super realistic sex scene demands for what to do actual cum shot on his chest
the shot where great was leaning in to kiss tyme with it intersplicing the future of them together plus the music made the scene so dreamy and romantic it was my fave scene of the episode
can you forgive me great okay way to break the heart of the audience before they are even a couple so as we know since he got into a damn knife fight with korn tyme was just trying to get closer to the family by going after great but as we also figured out tyme falls for real
i love the small cinematography moment of the nude bra on the sink in the bathroom with korn going to nan putting on her own nude bra boc is so good at cinematography that little teensy moments like that really are paid attention to
speaking of cinematography  we got that shot that bible ass in white undies shot but with the music and the rainy city scenery with the two grumpy kitties holding hands on the couch such a fucking gorgeous scene this show is such fucking eye candy and not just because of the people each angle and color choice is chefs kiss
i was so tense for nan when she was looking in the safe how does this all connect im so invested tongklas brother obviously got killed by someone important maybe the tongkla stuff is a totally different timeline than the great stuff i know that there has been some intersplicing but only from korns pov and he tends to wear a variation of the same outfit all the time
i wanna go on a kitty claw date
edit  the whiplash im getting because interspliced with this im on a big king in yellow kick so ive been watching the first season of true detective im going through the ringer with my current obsessions
gag

cause of death the heart killers 
im obsessed obsessed heres all my thoughts with more question than answers and no particupar way to tie them up dome is alive and im starting to believe tonklas brother is just a decoy the same way we thought white was someone else in dff did greats parents have something to do with tymes parentss death is that why hes after them when we started everything revolved around 11 oclock then great got stuck in 1101 and now hes on 1102 we seem to be progressing into 1104 4 minutes indeed but what do they represent tyme asked that same question to den why 4 minutes doesnt tume come across as stalkerish he really asked some rando and great doesnt find this unsettling they cute though during the date shouldnt last though and that ending was announced with the would you forgive me note
now tongkla i bow down to fuaiz baby is showing everyone how its done god hes so good both nc scenes have been super realistic this time around he went for his own pelasure and didnt care about wins the attentiin to detail with the come on his chest that had me gagged gagged boc is ona whole other level and im loving this relationship between sammon and boc its giving quality both in plot acting and cinematography no one is touching them im here for them 
3 eps 3  we are being served

this show reminds me a lot of the kdrama another miss oh where ml sees flashes of the future and it turns out that hes been dying the whole time and these are really flashbacks
omg crack pipe or pot 


bocs cinematography
i dont think that was weed he got way too high to fast for that


i was not prepared for this
no not at all
i know next week is the big nc scene but there has been an nc scene every week
fck me raw x2
full on naked butts
very realistic motions and noises
jrking off
and nowsemen
the only unrealistic scene was the oral sx scene on the woman
wow
im speechless
damn inspector stache is a goner loving them together kinda soft kinda hot 
lmao hes detective jjays already planning their wedding tbh 

he clearly identifies as a lesbian  got his movingin suitcase in the car
wandee goodday flashback to yak calling dee help 
god im dying watching those two theyre too precious 
lmao great is one of us like sameeeee dude

to this moment one naked axx per episode whf is that bl paradise by sure im even wondering if we deserve so much we deserve it right
im obsessed with fuaiz and jjay i need them to get their own series asap


fuuuuck this show has its foot on my fucking neck i stg i watched the whole episode w a smile on my face even through the heartbreak

the rebound shoutout  lol


damn poor boy tonkla just wants it raw  no chance ig


yay my baby tonkla making korn a cuckold im so proud d
honestly the chemistry between him and win omg love it
win i shouldnt be doing this youre still grieving
one minute later fuck that shit haha
also when is my baby tonkla gonna get bred hes desperate for a baby inside him 


bocs cinematography
i cannot see any of white in fuiaz in this show we are talking rightfully so about the duality of bible comparing great to vegas but fuiaz is doing such a good job
he wants to get fucked raw so damn bad he wants to feel it korn keeps him at arms length all the time so i totally get it he is on prep after all lol
kidnap 
i want to give tonkla a hug  poor baby he looks sad and lonely every episode honestly fuaiz just blows me he has such a broad emotional range so natural i want more tonkla
and they need to speed up with tyme and great hurry up i cant wait anymore this flirting is killin me 

we didnt think he would be this amazing too almost phenomenal
my head is spinning  i can only imagine the wildfire that were about to witness

damn fuaiz you really like raw hahaha
please the nc scene is so hot like jjayfuaiz are so into it

i saw someone on tiktok say its too early for greattyme scenes but im saying great knows hes gonna have sex with him anyway so why fight it

earthmix 
im super confused im not even pretending to understand but im enjoying the heck out of it anyway the scene at the car when great grabbed tymes hand i fucking felt it in my gut it was so magical the use of the incidental music was perfect im obsessed im going to die next week if were getting greattyme sexy times
is jess an angel


or the grim reaper

so ep 3 is out now omw to watch it lol


haha as mentioned above i am posting early to give everyone time to get ready  it airs in 1hr13min
this is the steamiest bl ive ever seen and it feels so grown besides kp this one of the few where it resonates with me

same lord same this slaps


exactly the subtle adult humour not overly dramatic it was giving greys anatomy casualty holby city esque kinda quality of the show

can somebody breed that twink already i feel bad for him this story wont end well for anyone 


this story wont end well for anyone
i am here right now but i so wish we didnt have to be here 


nahhh


earthmix 


ugh today i cant watch live either 


the nc scenes tho  im still shocked from it 


exactly nc scenes this good in a bl we have come so far my fellow fujoshisfudanshis

boc merch

arrrrrrggg i want


my theory is that were being tricked and somehow the timelines are messed up
the woman who talked with great and then talked with win was the same
isnt a picture of tonkla and dome but dome is alive in greats timeline and dead in tonklas one
my hot take is that there are alternative universes or tonklas story is not in the same timeline that greats one
oh and greats power activates when he rejects tyme or at least thats what i think it has happened twice now


cherry magic 
interesting take  about the power my guess is that it activates when great take a moral decision or dont take it like with the car accident first he runs and then he goes back in time after that not saying sorry to thyme after bumping into him and about dome situation but it does not really fit with the last after rejecting tyme invitation

i want them plushies


how many are there two sets what about the ones behind bible or were those from a time warp he had during the claw machine cause in his car he had only 2

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
mr cop saying no i shouldnt then immediately proceeding to fuck the hell out of our boy pls someone give it to him raw already
that reveal with jes was insane im looking forward to seeing what drama ensues from this


that reveal with jes was insane
that reveal totally gave me not me vibes when yokdan met
love when sth unexpected out of the usual pattern happens in cinema like youd expect him to knock great down and run away but he didnt and revealed himself instead i was clapping for that bold move like whats the aftermath of that will he uncover his planssecrets to great did he realize that he likes him more than he should and that great is actually innocent and needs to know the truth whatever its about so he might want to involve himself and help great otherwise how will he explain the whole situation with korn and nan great obv has no clue 


its 155am where i live and i have work in about 7 hours but i will be back here tomorrow with my review when i watch it
stay tuned


 will look forward to it have a good night 


okay im back and i watched it finally
why do i get the sense thyme knows what great is experiencing he either knows or is like manipulating the thing his name is literally thyme time the thai milk tea with his apology brooooo what i reckon these are flashbacks and the 4 minutes thing is like the ability to correct everything that went wrong before i dunno im trusting sammon because her writing always pulls through time stuck at 1101 thats when he died or when someone died surely
what kind of condition is this probably psychiatric great
why are the symptoms just like the patient in my research so its happening to more than 1 person
why is bible such a cutie pie in this its so weird considering ive only ever seen him as vegas i still havent watched spaceless but i love it i like non psychopathic bible
stuck at 21042151 mentally i havent left this place how does this episode end  biblexjes chemistry on point piss off theyre actually so cute
poor tonkla is a meth and sex addict and clearly not doing well boyfriend who has a girlfriend and ignores him brother whos just died no family and lives alone he may have just slept with the inspector to numb his pain but i reckon hell end up healing something in him that korn never could or will or hell end up arresting him because he probably murdered his brother
ohhhh who left the note
damn why does everyone in this show smoke  what does 1102 mean also how does great have the white cat too if he gave it to thyme love his little storyboard where hes just circled sex in red
i reaaallllyy dont like korn horrible vibes all round from him
so nan is thymes something i am stressed why did he show himself to great i have more questions than answers but i know this is how sammon works thyme clearly shady probably knows great is korns brother and just wants info hence the apology on the cup in the flashback he probably kills him or gets him killed or cant save him i just know its gonna be so so satisfying when all of these unconnected stories connect mystery bl is so where its at genuinely struggling with gmmtv shows at the moment so thank god for 4 minutes
actually so excited for next week can we skip a week into the future 


no korn peaches this ep but we got win and tonklatonkla is a meth headpoor boy who did you killdr tyme is avenging dr ex maybenan rummaging through the shareholder listuncle warits police lt col stands outno illegal biz prospers without their blessingso next ep we will have  of dr tyme and great i presumeother 4minute patient from the back looks like greats mom thats her hairstyle maybe

i thought the other patient is the lady dr dan interviewed in ep1 lukwa or sth

is nan the ex
can someone fuck tonkla raw the guy is screaming for it
bible cannot have that fatass and doctor not eating it so im expecting some of that
i was surprised by tyme revealing himself at the end that was a great way to end the episode the anticipation for the next one is hugeee
the only thing that takes me out from the dramaticsuspense type of vibe that the show has which i love it gives it a very mature format is when there are lightcomedy moments like when tyme and the other doctor are bickering the silly sound effects is so very much thai style but i kind of wish they werent there just cause they feel out of place with the overall format of the series but thats the only thing the rest is amazing


can someone fuck tonkla raw the guy is screaming for it
durex is the sponsor shown at the end of the credits so i think poor tonkla will never get his wish 

the comedy is subtle and made me chuckle the comedic timing is so great especially when dr tyme was checking his biceps before he went to go treat greats wound

types olive oil stained broken hip
ok so episode 3 served all the things
cute date check if that was not the most realistic first date i have ever seen in a bl from the cute moments to the i dont know what to do next glances and the almost kiss absolutely perfect
that nc sceneum tonkla is now my own personal code word for that specific activity but seriously can we get him in rehab dont need to se that
bible and jes just get it
that was awesome the acting is 1010 the show is a vibe the story is intriguing im hooked


bible and jes just get it
that was awesome the acting is 1010 the show is a vibe the story is intriguing im hooked
agreed
but seriously can we get him in rehab dont need to se that
no he found his cop that will heal all until the black cat  from ep1 kills all of us

and to think that they had prolly like 50 people watching them when filming that nc scene 


nope pond makes sure to clear the set for the nc scenes he is the intimacy director he keeps just the camera guy whenever possible and maybe 1 other person in the room with the actors
he also never shoots or allows behind the scenes content for the nc scenes

great and tymes date was so cute  but then the last scene happened  and next week might be jesbible sex scene i dont know if ill be prepared
i seriously doubt my sanitys chances of surviving this series

the best thai bl of the year so far





where can i watch the uncut version arghhh


viu with a vpn set to thailand or philippines and you will need a premium subscription to watch immediately or you can watch for free after 72hrs i included this info and instructions up on the post for this episode


i can give you a link to a website


the version im watching has very crappy subtitles and its not translating anything written so ive been relying on the translate app on my phone when i try and get the handwritting on the cup i get a different translation each time
can anyone tell me what these say

the original one said something like you should check out your wound in the hospital and the alternative one said im so sorry great
i was shocked tonk doing meth and had the bubbler and everything i knew he had to be h word 


lmaoo not u slt shaming him

in my villain era
sooois he doing meth is that supposed to be hard drugs or just weed sounds like a bong tbh
white and tee have come so far since dff  jjays acting has substanially improved
this plot feels like a sammon story doctor main charicter morally grey areas timeywhimey mysterycrime
this cinmatorgrapy thoughthe staging camera angles the intetional message in the shotsmy nerdy little self loved it almost as much as those nc scences


sooois he doing meth
in ep1 he was looking for drugs in a clear platic baggy small so coke or meth cause weed doesnt come in those baggies  at least not enough to put in a bong i plead the 5th dont ask me how i know 

got a feeling the cop is gonna be hurt bc they only did that that bc hes grieving right


correct

thanks for all the vpn advice folks ive caught up and oh my fking god


yay welcome

the way this is just a  masterpiece 




the twist at the end like jes just came out of nowhere and almost killed his bro  why is nobody talking abt that


haha because last week we had the reveal at the end of ep2 about jes working with the crazy hair girl to tear down korns bros business so when korn kidnapped the girl and she called jes right before she threw her phone in the water we knew it was jes coming for korn


this is my new favorite show i can not i was screaming and crying and laughing the whole time i love a plot that has 10 layers and is all confusing at the beginning 3


i hope its good because i just watched a sad movie for the second time and i need some cheering up


did it lift your spirits if not try knock knock boys ep12 just that episode it lifted my spirits yesterday when i needed them lifed 


sooo
ok my conspiracy theory is tymes parents were killed by greats parentshis eyes were too serious when they were talking about their struggles otherwise why would he bother with it as a doctor and it is somehow related to that illegal gambling branch also both great and korn are unrelated i guess their single parents got remarried and korns birth mother committed suicide
so basfuaiz is almost over huh  but both are sus korn is a stuck up greedyand tonkla is the murdererhe uses win to get info slowly and is threatening him  also i saw 2 bras this ep i guess i guess they were emphasizing the hidden meaningkorn is tied to his fianc more
also that nan girl is held captive so basically she sent it to tyme
i might get downvoted but it felt like jesbible are too serious in a way that claw machine sceneit didnt feel lighthearted for me but advantage is it suits them both for all the other scenes im just not feeling their cutesy scenes 
also i liked the editing for wintonkla nc scene it was a bit dark for me but it perfectly fits the vibe win is so in love but for tonkla he is just a tool it perfectly fits the characters vibe jjfuaiz are good actorstoo bad tonkla wanted it raw but both kornwin are too careful about protection 
also the reveal in the last scene wow the story pace is perfect i still dont know how theyll answer all the questions that keep on building up tonkla brother mysterywho is he  serial kills 4 mins first scenefirst ep near death of tymegreat also title what happened to him also whats with the grandma patient in this ep dentyme i think it is not of much importance i guess tymes ex that the nurses were gossiping aboutgirlis tyme a psychopath etc we still dont have much answers hope they reveal it in the end
i have more n more questions than answers now

aww i just rewatched the claw machine scene and i thought it was pretty cute hehe it has that awkward not quite sure of each other getting to know each other feel but thats the thing with stuff like this what works for some people wont work for others and vice versa


also both great and korn are unrelated i guess their single parents got remarried and korns birth mother committed suicide
no they are actually siblings half brothers their dad was married to korns mom when he had an affair and created great with greats mom since greats mom was the mistress she and great lived in a separate house than the dad once korns mom killed herself or in my opinion once greats mom figured out how to get rid of korns mom the dad moved great and his mom into the family home this is kdrama family dynamics 101 

i have to agree with you on that claw machine comment i felt bro romance i was a bit disappointed 
i agree with the claw machine date the whole series is so serious at least in terms of filming it gives very depressing vibe im so worried for great the whole time that even i couldnt enjoy the date its definitely lacking the funny moments but ig thats the vibe that they were goin for what else would we expect from ml who is batman at night and surgeon during daytime i wish there a character for some comedic relief im not liking any character rn cuz all r giving trust issues except great


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
i cant wait to watch this


we deserve the incredible acting from this cast we deserve the impeccable writing direction cinematography of this series and ive seen gay men on twitter say they love it for the accurate depiction of gay sex were always on our toes to see whats going to happen next shout out to boc and the whole cast what an amazing show


yeah we cant thank them enough for excelment cast writing and direction

i rewatched the claw machine scene multiple times and starting to feel that great is us trying to claw our way to their first kiss 





ok i said something similar yesterday but here i come again
there are two different timelines
in the original one everything went to shit great ended in the hospital having a heart attack tyme was shot in the streets and dome was murdered by title
tonklas story is the starting point of this timeline when dome is killed by title and from there well see what happened to get that tragic ending where the two main leads die
the great of this timeline who is about to die sends part of his consciousness to the past creating the new timeline where he tries to fix things
the moment great does something wrong or his choices take him away from tyme his future self intervenes sending him a heart attack and 4 minutes back in time as a way to say you took the wrong path dude fix it inmediately
future great just has 4 minutes to change his past in his present timeline where he is dying thats why the great of the new timeline keeps seeing the time as 1101 1102
probably when he gets at 1104 hell die in the hospital if things go wrong again or the new timeline will overwrite the first one and everyone will be saved
of course this is just a theory of mine maybe im wrong


do you think the timelines are science fiction type of timelines or just different pov based on his unconscious mind

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
this is a great theory ill be thinking of it as i watch and rewatch the next episodes

i am enjoying 4 minutes so freaking much this show is so right up my alley it fulfills both my love for bls and crimethriller at the same time  the story is intriguing the cinematography is amazing the quality fire and jes and bibles chemistry is  i am very impressed by fuaizs acting as well this show is an absolute delight to watch  its so good 





for some reason i have the feeling that tonkla will kill korn what we saw in ep 2 it would also make sense that he killed his brother himself he didnt really seem happy that win wants to investigate the murder but that seems too simple but i feel like hes guilty of something maybe indirectly caused the death of his brother
maybe greats parents killed thymes parents somehow and he wants revenge and thats why he got close to great or at the very least to get to korn then he will apologize later with the note on the coffee for using great but again that feels to simple i guess we will get even more fights from them
i think that the suicidal woman from episode 1 and her son are related to all of the murder or the casino somehow i think we will see her sons death later probably murdered
thymes coworker definitely got a thing for thyme remember episode 1 when he got weirdly close to him seems like an unrequited crush
i think that the girl who wrote the comment thinks that title killed tonklas brother the girl seemed to be too scared to talk about who did it and after her friend i think it was her was locked up by title and after dome was beaten up by him it seems like the most obvious conclusion from her point of view
as we know titles father is very influential so it would make sense that she is scared or it could be that she meant someone whos involved with greats familys business as they are also influential or obviously tonklathe murderer is definitely someone influential anyway as they probably bribed the police
i mean i could be that title is the dead brother but from her point of view if title was dead i dont think she would have written the comment she probably would be happy that hes dead so i say that he is not the brother
dome could be the brother then title would be the obvious murderer from her point of view but that would mean there are two timelines but as they hid the brothers face it has to be someone we know but we dont know many male characters yet except dome and title who could be related to him but i hope its not dome


the officer ans tonkla had great sexual tension


they did

i can do it with a broken heart
my thoughts on episode 3 ok so the timeline of the police boy is ahead to the one we see with tyme and great yes
dome wakes up at somewhere in the nearer future when great and tyme are already fucking so im guessing tyme is screwing over korn for revenge because great somehow found out about his familys real business and thats why he despises them  and hes probably dead by that time which is why tyme is out to get them
also tyme is clearly lying about how he knows stuff about great man this is so fucked up all of it its great 

i can do it with a broken heart
so 1101 is when great technically died yeah and tyme clearly isnt a green flag but using great

my obsession with mio rearing its ugly head every time his on the screen  he has this thing  that i cant explain
and its driving me nuts


i am so confused

firstkhao sandray akkayan kantbison 
3 episodes in im just losing interest on greattymesomething something about lack of connection or lack of chemistry between the actorsits just not clicking im far more invested in the korntonklawin scenerio and greats family scenerio
thoughtsallday


meanwhile the greattyme chemistry has me by the throat  their chemistry is literally palpable for me
its the way tyme is supposed to act i think his main goal behind befriending great was to get revenge of some sort he holds prejudice against riches great is innocent and cant see his creepy stalker behaviour and takes tyme as sincere person but we can clearly see tyme has some other plans his feelings are not genuine at all so ig the off chemistry was intentionally done

did you not catch the last part tyme did not genuinely talk to great with the intention of dating him hes there to get info or something about his family im pretty sure hes the one the girl sent the message to hence the lack of genuine connectionthe girls complaining about fuaiz getting railed every episode must be having an absolute conniption fit by now hollering 

ive seen bas ass more than my own lmfaooo

as we should lol bas looks better out of his clothes than he does in them and he looked so cute in the college flashback the longer floppy hair suits him so well 

ive been into him since that bar scene in kp

cause of death the heart killers 
baby is not stepping off that gas pedal any time soon he even got 2 in this episode 
serious business i know but bible looks so cute here lmao


the whole ep i was like hes so cute omg
especially during the greattyme nc scenee i was watching it through my hands bc they were so soft i cant

when he was lying on the bed heart racing unable to calm down and smiling so much i was just like
tyme thinking fucking would help calm great down had me choking tho

hes a doctor he knows whats good for you 

really leisurely boring sex exactly i cant wait until great has him totally dickmatized riding him

i need that riding scene sorrynotsorry

sweetsoft bible is everything really 

vegaspete  kenta deserves 
i am at work for another couple of hours but now im going to be so distracted about greattyme nc scene that im not sure if i can get any work done
also bible in white is a look that i am loving he looks sooooo good in all of the clothes and his appearances

yess i noticed great is wearing white a lot 
bible looks good in it 


vegaspete  kenta deserves 
look at that waist i will not complain about bible in white

i swear 65 of the shows budget went to bibles wardrobe lol


vegaspete  kenta deserves 
i feel like all the kp fans were totally trolled with this shirt no buttons low cut but no buttons

toast inspector general
massive nc warning
tymes pace gradually speeding up is so fucking peak i cannot no slomo sultry scenes here


bocs cinematography
spread tattooed thighs are so hot


 glistening skin

from this messy hair point till they finished its exactly 4minutes


thank you for clocking that i watched twice and failed to clock anything 


i dont think i blinked in this episode let alone look at a clock 
win is such a fatal attraction mess hes acting like the wife being cheated on 


bocs cinematography
win is a mess

i keep forgetting his characters name and just call him confused cop jj
gag

we love a sassy power bottom in this household
boi knows what he wants and how he needs to be treated fr
kick korns ass to the curb sis

ton should keep them both tbh win for the raw sex and obsessive nature and korn for the  and more sex lol


for clarification for those asking if ton kla finally got his wish up me means cum inside me and our cop delivered just that 

dead dead absolutely dead omg dead

when win dropped his bags i screamed lol honestly this is what i dont understand about bl the whole no no we cant possibly bit where guy 1 is forward and ready to go and guy 2 is always saying no and looking disinterested the way win is always down to fuck when prompted is probably the most realistic portrayal of mm relationship dynamics ive seen in a bl so far
boc stays dragging the gworls


not just mm many people are down to fuck at any time so like i do not comprehend this either but yes i love cop being completely ready to go immediately without hesitation
omg my standin flashbackkkkk lol
helllllllp

the straddling  lifting up part always gets me exquisite 
in that clip i am going to assume tonkla finally got his goal raw power there cause i didnt see the product placement


bocs cinematography
i recently read a book called recursion by blake crouch i highly recommend it and him as an author his books are great  especially dark matter and its premise was that there was a thing called a memory chair that had initially been created to help people with alzheimers but you could use it to go back to a specific memory and relive your life starting from that point however you and the people around you who were affected by the memory change would get false memories once the timelines converged in the future and they would remember the dead timeline and it didnt end up great usually
it made me wonder if we are seeing dead timelines here moving together the picture of tongkla and his brother when they were kids sure looked like dome i think we are seeing two timelines overlapping with each other and great is the recursionconvergence so when we see tongkla we are seeing a timeline where dome wasnt saved mod is the friend that win tried to question who we of course also see with great maybe tongkla killed title as revenge but maybe he killed someone else korn or great since this case is obviously metastasizing titles dad is a big deal  is the police chief titles dad and thats why hes trying to cover up the murder its just a working theory and obviously not all fleshed out and i could be way off base but just putting it out there
i know people arent here for plot theories today and are here for the porn but why not both

im always here for the porn with plot so that is one interesting theory thanks and chapeau 

this theory seems very plausible
multitasking between plot and soft pretty pornwannabe is what boc is so good at
the kissingggggg  so wait theyre gonna have another sexy time scene right because in greats visions hes riding someone tyme lol 


bocs cinematography
this was my fave shot of the whole episode out of all the shots in all the sex scenes this felt the most mutual and equal they werent having sex here they were lovemaking


im really starting to think that tonkla is the real main character of 4 minutes d

and he keeps showing us why he could be
my good sis did not put his pants back on i am screaminggggg


bocs cinematography
he just looks like a heartbroken little boy here he is so pathetically in love


hes so down bad hes crying at the gym at the club at the police station everywhere
this boi he barely knows has him gagged fr


bocs cinematography
tongkla got that magic asshole
i just keep smh and laughing everytime he looks so forlorn because of bb ton ton is truly gong to ruin his life lol

i was laughing the whole scene lakjdflkfj
im saying why didnt he put his pants on 

i cant believe we saw actual 

i have never seen  or  and this has both

i was screaming so fking high like please you had plenty of time to put the goddman pants on
hot
help

so this was rather sweet  unexpectedly
i guess it supposed to show the contrast between greats innocent sweet love development and whatever is going on in tonklas messed up world 


right a little brighter literally and it would look like its a scene from a different show it was a nice break from all the angst and desperation and whatever in tonklas lifehomescenes
help


i am waiting for your contribution with the brightened scenes 
wins dying while tons having the time of his life screaming


bocs cinematography
i absolutely love this dynamic of the simp top compared to the power bottom we get it so rarely in bls because of their heteronormative dynamic

this series is doing a spectacular job of telling stories through intimate scenes imho i feel like 90 of the scenes weve seen tongkla in were somehow related to sex and yet he also feels like the character i know best and feel most connected to its not just sex all those scenes tell us so much about who he is as a person and i love that
that flashback to his first time with korn i was honestly shook its such an emotionally complicated scene korn definitely holds the power there and it certainly feels a little weird only time will tell what kind of person korn really is part of me at the same time cant help feeling sorry for korn never being able to be himself around his family for not being able to make true on his promise meanwhile tongkla is just so vulnerable and open i honestly got goosebumps
and now with win he seems to repeat the sexual patterns korn taught him i guess this is just how he has learned to show and receive love except this time tongkla is very much the one holding the reins for the first time hes in a relationship inasfar as we can call it that where hes not dependent and hes enjoying having power over someone for once while at the same time filling whatever hole is left in his soul hes really a very lonely character
like most people i am also definitely wondering whether he is the murderer though especially after that opening scene
tldr i am absolutely fascinated by the dynamics between these three characters
and then we have great and tyme i did feel like i wanted them to have a bit more of a chat before moving on to the nc scene but then they looked at each other and i honestly stopped caring lmao the gentle hair brush the way great kept laughing a little it all felt so real honestly kudos to whoever is directing all those intimate scenes and the actors executing them chefs kiss no notes
im also wondering if their closeness being slightly rushed is intentional if theyre feeling more drawn to each other because they already have history that great is vaguely recalling from wherever and this is making them feel closer and more trusting of each other than they should maybe be
also i assume the other person in that red room that woman was seeing was great but i thought it looked more like tyme tbh or am i just imagining things
no we are not okay boys what have you done to us


i mean i love them however adrenaline induced sex does not look this calm though 

4 minutes is amazing
the second amazing thing is coming here and reading those shameless comments 
and i am here for it

perfect 10 liners
i knew this episode was gonna be steamy but it exceeded my expectations the jesbible debut was spectacular and it seems tonkla got his wish because i didnt see officer stache suit up
also what was that ending i have so many questions

for the millionth time imma say it again fuaiz better be getting that bagggg also we been knew who his brother was but i was still gagged so my theory is that there are two worlds the one before and after the 4 minutes
the way bible and jes were smiling through the nc scene was so cute


bocs cinematography
omg i was right hahaha  peep my post before the episode started we have overlapping timelines
the difference between then tongkla and now tongkla is staggering i dunno  i feel like korn groomed him korn obviously does love tongkla but he was tongklas first lover rescued him from an abusive household bought him a house gilded cage promised him that he would tell the world that he was tongklas boyfriend  only to have a fiancee and tongkla is still the dirty secret sidepiece that he doesnt call for weeks and only comes to fuck him and didnt care about what tongkla had been going through until tongkla forced the matter you dare to kick me out isnt a line you use with someone that you really truly love
korn was so villainous this episode even the scenes where he was being sweet with tongkla had a sinister undercurrent he groomed this boy hes trying to be good cop with nan even though hes running an illegal casino and trying to have the high ground his reaction to finding out that tongklas brother was dead wasnt oh baby im so sorry let me comfort you it was who did it so i can exert power of them for you to further engraciate you to me
win is such a mess hes down bad for this broken beautiful boy like he looked so pathetic and sad coming out from hiding in his underwear heartbroken that tongkla had someone else he was love at first sight and will never know a moment of peace from now on the way that tongkla was so fucking happy to get fucked raw was hot as hell but just really sad too korn has always kept him at arms length in his lonely apartment and is keeping him a secret so he just wanted to feel something this triangle is so interesting to me
i kinda wish wed gotten more explanation about what exactly is happening with tyme and nan great was just like okay ill help you and there hasnt really been many questions besides that maybe well get some answers next week after theyve fucked it out of their systems props to nan though that girl is not breaking
i loved the contrast between all the sex scenes in terms of tone wintonkla was so desperate and full of need korntonkla was very sweet and innocent except had this sinister air around it because we know how their relationship ended up despite korns pinkie promise and tymegreat was full of smiles and while it was kind of awkward it was very sweet and naturally so the first time is never fireworks
lukwa is so cute her and den in the same scenes just smiling are so healing they both have such great warm smiles so she was the one that great saw which i had already assumed
if greattyme doesnt have a 5 min scene like tonkorn ill shit myself

pahahahahah gorllll i knew it
cacklinggg

the sights the sounds the faces 

im choking


im not sure if its part of the character but dr tymejes has the sweetest most deliberate gestures his index finger here seems to be counting the seconds until he makes his next move



ahhhhhhhhhh we finally got soft bottom bible this bl just keeps getting better and better with every ep 

this picture


bocs cinematography
i love this shot because you can see the power dynamic despite the height difference
ifylita 1 fan 
they have this otherworldly chemistry so casual and sweet i need more screen time of them next ep 

ifylita 1 fan 
tonkla side quest getting fucked raw []
wait is this the first ep with a  rating like how explicit are we actually talking here if we already saw almost everything in the prior episodes  im

im actually glad the main couples nc scene is more soft and slow burn because its going to make the last couple of episodes a lot spicier haha that being said they need a lot more scenes together to make up for the lack of screen time though


ok it took me two watches to soak it all in the first watch had a lot of ff and 20x to see quickly if it was safe now i rewatched fully and calmly and without being completely lost in the incredible varying emotions of the ncs that honestly had me laying on the cold tile floor in my office for a bit
ok here we go
after watching every single episode of criminal minds for yearsi immediately recognized korns manipulation at work since ep1 but in this episode it was clear that he is without the shadow of doubt a narcissistic sociopath who manipulates because it brings him a high that he cant get any other way sociopaths are incapable of feeling love what they feel is adrenaline and power when they can control and inflict emotional pain on other humans while giving the appearance of being well intentioned
from the flashback we learned that korn intentionally made ton kla remove the cat collar he smiled as he watched brokenhearted ton kla kneel down and get the collar anyone with humanity if they truly cared about another human would have removed the collar for them his intentions were not genuine even back then he saw a broken prey that he could mold into everything he wanted and make him dependent on korn emotionally and financially there is zero love from korn ton kla is just a release for korn from the way he feels powerless in his relationship with his father stepmother and fianc and the cat collar was intentioned as reminder to ton kla of korns alleged caring but to korn that was a key to his control he even immediately tied a ribbon around ton klas head to claim his ownership over every thought of tonkla going forward he owns him now forever
their first time shown here in parallel to greattymes first time which was fueled by adrenaline
the scene where we saw title trust great to kills someone with him showed us that greats personality lends to his friends trusting him blindly however when he refused to kill and we were told he also released the imprisoned girl in a prior episode was foreshadowing to todays episode great doesnt hesitate to do the right thingafter he considers and sees the alternative he didnt jump in to help tyme or to save this girl today until after he saw the consequences of his inaction and it makes complete sense that he would help tyme without any hesitation after he heard and saw the consequences of inaction on his part
i dont think this series has any romance tbh this is a series about human intentions and decisions and adrenaline induced action i dont think great is in love with tyme at all and the other way around either they are somehow being pulled together by grief and curiosity and power and mainly adrenaline
and ton kla is now acting towards cop the same way he learned from korn the tables are turned his constant request for raw or up me for those that dont know that means he wants cop to cum inside him is symbolica desperate yearning to feel something real
bas is honestly killing it every micro expression is giving sociopath and the contrast of his gentle voice is perfection he wants to appear gentle while being lethal he did the same exact song and dance with the kidnapped girl as he does with ton kla
and his rage and tear filled eyes when ton kla kicked him out was not hurt because his love kicked him out it was rage that the object he owned had the gall to turn on him
this series is honestly spectacular
every single detail has a purpose cop coming back in without pants shows he is not covering anything up he is raw and exposed and down bad for ton kla he has saviors syndrome he sees a broken boy and wants to be his savior the same way korn seemed to be that but korn was dressed immaculately and wearing panties  and he asked ton kla to remove them while cop immediately willingly removed all his layers korn also asked ton kla not to remove his shirt he said he would do it he kept a layer of the shirt on ton kla their entire first time while with cop ton kla was completely exposed
i know many may say that the ncs are gratuitous and perhaps with a lot more writing the same nuances of these characters could maybe have been told with clothes but the fact that everything in every nc so far has had symbolic meaning is spectacular
also bibles tats had me so dead also greats red car has me in a chokehold however i wish they didnt ride the gears like they did cause my heart hurt for the car
great screaming oh shit and just yelling on the bridge also told us that great is highly addicted to this adrenaline he has been mostly calm from our pov but today showed us that adrenaline is definitely a drug he liked at first try
note 4 minutes from the hair
black cat from ep1 then we had the cats from the claw machine too lots of cats oh god then we have greats actual cat man i hope nothing happens to that cat 


bocs cinematography
hard agree about korn there was something so sinister about him this episode

is it really a bas series wo bas getting drunk and letting loose lol
anyone else think clip before the credits are the real version of events ep1 great is in hospital coding at 11 oclock whilst tyme is being gunned down ep2 tongkla murdering someone with a rock ep3 a body is found ep4 murder investigations with someone being linked by dna cop guy seems to know the name
greats scenes appear fragmented to me we dont see much interaction with tyme they just kind of end up in places like their date when they are in the hotel room great even laughs saying he doesnt know where they are its all safe and romantic when theyve just gone on the run supposedly we dont see great question anything thats happening with his family and tymenan hes mostly in white and tyme in black i think hes reliving memories that great and tyme are dying at the same time
my guess with tongkla is that he manipulated moustache cop into helping him find out who killed his brother afterwards once they find out the police protected title he helps him get revenge i think moustache cop is the one shooting tyme but then where does korn fit into it all and why is tyme a victim i dont know why we are seeing dome go back to tongklas house other than tongkla is hallucinating
the 4 minutes room with that lady im guessing is some kind of pergatory i cant explain the psychologist friend of tymes meeting the lady and great though
sorry for long comment i cant sleep  loved this episode and reading everyones theories

yall im not prepared for whatever is about to happen 
prayer circle for us all to survive 
its happeninggggg dont hold ur breath 


i am shook that we saw actual dick shook
omg


bocs cinematography
you dare kick me out
bitch the way you were just manhandling him after weeks of no contact without asking why he seemed so down man fuck korn there was something so villainous about him this episode

i am glad he kicked him out he deserves so much better but i think he is definitely not over him

18 clockt
get it boys 


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
durex did not sponsor this episode i repeat durex did not sponsor this episode 
i love tonklawin scenes sm sad broken boys is my jam and tonkla is delivering on that part and win is just willing to give and give and give to someone that cannot reciprocate is both heartbreaking and hilarious to watch the man is whipped
bible was magnetic in this episode the way he portrayed being on a adrenaline high and trying to calm down from that the way he laughed and smiled at tyme before and during sex was mesmerising i didnt feel like the greattyme sex scene was too intimate there was a lightness to it like they were comfortable with each other but not yet in love w each other
if we assume that there are two timelines and each timeline has its own people like there is the tonkla that lost his brother and the tonkla that didnt then that means there should be another great there is a great that did not save any of the people hes saved in the past 4 episodes including tyme i think that that great is the one having a heart attack stuck for 4 minutes somewhere between life and death trying to fix everything before its too late


while i dont mind the tonkla win and korn triangle story i am disappointed at how little screentime greattyme is getting i havent actually paid attention to minutes but it feels like they arent getting their fair share considering they are supposed to be the main couple 
their nc scene almost felt a bit sudden to me because we didnt have much of a relationship progression during the episode it went from rescue the girl to first time so quickly it felt a bit odd i hope we get to see more of them and what their deals are from now on

ngl im 35 minutes in and im a tiny bit annoyed at how korn tonkla focused this is particularly since this is the intheatre ep i have no problem with side couples but the balance is starting to feel really off with the amount of scenes weve had of korntonkla and wintonkla vs the very little with tyme and great
sigh anyway will come back here later with more


really i would not mind if the whole show is about them i normally prefer the main couple too but here tonkla and his triangle have stolen my heart and attention

already screaming

lmao this show


omg that was absolutely insane 
there were exactly 3 sex scenes multiple butts so many snatched waistlines and a dick
also i dont even know where to begin theorizing and were halfway done
i woke up this morning and remembered this kiss
tonkla 

earthmix 
i knew it

time seems to pause as they hover close a beautiful blend of longing and restraint its like their world and perhaps ours too shrinking to just this moment tymes kisses is so purposeful shows so much intent
we indeed had a great time with greattyme pun intended


best pun of the day 


i am yet again reminded that i hope this show had a good intimacy coordinator on set 


pond is the intimacy director and he ensures there is a closed set so just the actors and the camera guy and maybe 1 lighting person if needed

is this sub dead or what are other people watching im so excited for this series every week 


we are watching in fetal position atm heavily medicated


listen i dont know if it was just me but i think i waited more from the nc scene of greattyme or maybe their scene is to be more like this more romantic than the ones from tonkla to show us a more deep romantic connection between greattyme
like even the scene of tonklawin was more hornier than theirs
i dont even feel like this episode was that on fire 18 like they had been saying for a week in that poster
anyways so dome really was tonkla brother at the end i guess tonkla killed title the brothers murderer remember that opening scene from episode 2
i wonder what will happen with tonkla and the cop because that scene of korn wanting to force tonkla excuse me you can see that tonkla no longer loves korn like he did in the past he just waited him to get out to go down on win oo
this is really getting toxic now i can sense a big jealous murderous beating moment coming up oh my god oo
at this point im definitely more involved and interested with korn tonkla and win story than the mains sorry


i thought the same on the greattyme scene but hopefully we will get more from them theirs was definitely framed as more romantic so thats likely why it wasnt as over the top
ditto i was all set for it to be intense and serious given the buildup however those little moments of chatter between them actually brought a suprising warmth there was so much thoughtfulness in their exchanges judging from the deliberations even though its clear how much they want each other at this point im already rooting for them to have a happily ever after but of course we all know theyre just getting started

i feel the same way but theres more nc scenes to come cause that aint the one they advertised on the pilot thank god

omg kan and tul finally 


so little was explained and it happened so suddenly but my lordt the scene with great and tyme at the end was one of the most beautiful first time scenes ive ever seen a tiny bit awkward yet soft and tender ahh

jes doesnt walk he glides and steps through spaces as if the ground beneath him is merely a suggestion rather than a barrier fml i am obsessing over this again i need help


 i love this so much i am seeing fragments of jes through these onairs someone is obessed with the way he taps his index finger i love all of these micro observations so much putting them all together is beautiful

i was not expecting to see a soft  in a bl drama before

am ecstatic because baskorns sexy peaches are here againoh lets add dr tymesif the black cat was dead while korn and tonkla was still at uni then the black cat after the first nc scene with korn and tonkla was a flashbacklove the contrast great in white dr tyme in blackso it was lady lukwa with great in the 400 minute roomthree people held that rock the murder weapontitlegreattonklaso which of these three is mr anuwat warindej whose fingerprints are in the police database which means this person has a prior record


if the black cat was dead while korn and tonkla was still at uni then the black cat after the first nc scene with korn and tonkla was a flashback
so i was thinking the same thing mayne not necessarily a flashback but somehowe inside of ton klas mind just like the cab seemed like dome was alive like wishful thinking or both ton kla and great are kinda dying and we are seeing inside both of their brains

alright at the end of the day i dont really know whats going on ive read all the theories here and on mdl ive watched every ep at least twice and ep 2 five times
it could be that sammon has revealed all the clues and its just a matter of putting them together and someone here has already gotten it right it could also be that shes withholding key clues that once revealed would rule out everyones theories
i think sammon has played with both corruption and timeline changes in her past works so its not clear to me which direction she may take it im not going to focus on the question of timelines  alternate realities ill wait for more information
i do think that were seeing many morally grey characters im not sold on any of our mains  great tyme tonkla korn win  being all good or all bad not even title is all bad he didnt seem like a bad friend to great when we first meet him tyme seems like a cold jerk but is obviously very tender to his grandma and is fighting for a good cause great makes bad choices and regrets them
i also think were seeing how sex can be experienced and used in a variety of ways  love desperation escape control i agree with uthoughtsallday that were learning so much through those sex scenes the difference between ton klas blissed out love expression after he and korn have sex in ep 1 is in stark contrast to his expressionlessempty face after he has sex with win greattyme seem to be just two dudes who fell for each other and are actually having like relationship sex which is both attraction and connection its maybe not my favorite storytelling technique but its definitely well telling a story
at the end of the day i think the series has an interesting plot and is something different than usual and thats fun i liked the series more when i thought it was going to be romance and a happy ending but this is not that so now im a bit emotionally distant from it because sammon isnt here to comfort me and make me believe in the power of love at least i dont think she is i dont know ive never finished a sammon series
i mean personally i prefer explicit yearning tension romance more cardigans and a guaranteed happy ending over like murder sadness and graphic desperation sex but i am happy to be watching something in realtime again as part of a community


sammon isnt here to comfort me and make me believe in the power of love at least i dont think she is i dont know ive never finished a sammon series
 yeah sammon is not one that likes to comfortsadly
im glad you were able to come to terms with the fact this isnt a romance yet are still finding ways to enjoy it differently this may be the first sammon series you finish especially given it is 8 eps not 13 as per her usual
you may not be comforted by sammon but i cant explain to you the comfort i feel seeing you engaged in this puzzle of clues 



you have talked about the nc scenes so my turn to talk about the mystery
the theory of at least two timelines has been proven true
in one of them dome is alive and happily talking and visiting tonkla and in the other one is dead and tonkla is grieving
i read the theory that the happy timeline doesnt exist and its just great fixing his mistakes in his mind before passing away sincerely i hope you are not right i know boc shows doesnt characterize for having a super happy endings but i dont need a show where everyone is dead hello there dff
if there are two timelines then we havent met yet the key characters in the other timeline
we havent watched tonkla in the happy timeline where his brother is alive he talked with dome on telephone but we just saw the sad tonkla who doesnt see his brother
we havent watched great and tyme in the sad timeline except in the prologue where both of them are dying great didnt save the woman in the first episode dome and nan in this timeline so he probably is not a goody two shoes and we dont know tyme either but i think he is more or less the same in both timelines
ps i know a lot of you are fed up of tonkla having too much screentime but he has to be a key character maybe the antagonist so probably is not wasted time

thoughts this the day i have still a few hours to go but ill be glued to my seat


omg i dont knowwww all signs point to yes  but i dont knowwww ive seen spoilers from korea since it already aired there but they are from scenes that were in the trailer so not sure 

im sorry but when will bible get kissed the way he deserves lmaooooo and lets be real that bottom was not having fun 
still love the ep tho jes still is an eye candy love seeing and hearing him 
i love this plot kinda getting tired of tonklas nc scenes but he acts so well


jes at least kissed him back unlikehe who shall not be namedcough build

bocs cinematography
really because i saw it as great staring intently at tyme drinking in all his reactions unlike the other nc scenes  win and tongkla only passingly looked at each other because it was all about desperate pleasure and korn and tongkla felt so meticulous like korn was taking tongkla apart psychically and physically but great cared how tyme was reacting he wanted to see the effect he was having he wasnt moaning and wailing and arching but you dont look that intently at someone during sex if youre having a bad time you tend to face away or stare up at the ceiling or keep your eyes closed

well that episode certainly was an episode
damn
im so confused tho but im confident that it wont be a mess like chains of heart 


im looking forward to some point in the future when i can watch this with proper subtitles im sure it will make even more sense


heres my rating on the realism of the nc scenes in this episode from the perspective of a gay male haha im just going by order and leaving out names for spoilers sake this is just based on realism not my enjoyment 
6510 the spice is there for sure but the facial expressions from the actors are a bit over exaggerated it feels a bit comical without context also no lube or prepping in sight lol
810 a rather short scene so not much to judge but pretty realistic overall if they were going to do anything in that position however the top should probably be a little lower
8510 one of the better first time scenes but again they kind of skip over any lubeprepping what makes it good though is the pacing and body placementnatural movement from both actors only thing is the bottoms thighs should up a little higher the moaning pauses kisses in between and natural movement definitely shows both actors experience though


ok so i had already lost all hope of korn being a good guy back when he took over the illegal part of the business without seemingly having any issues with it and then obv how he just straight up ignored poor tonkla in the last episode
but man this episode just drove it home further that he is a baad dude he didnt contact ton for weeks and then just shows up whines about the bad time hes had and immediately wants some action without picking up on ton obviously being down and then doesnt even jump to comforting mode when he is told that tons brother got killed wow
the flashback to them during college is so sad all things considered
ton was obviously inexperienced and prob also seeking love and support after coming from a shitty household and korn really moulded him into his perfect little dirtysecretsidepiece that he could use and control with promises of love and future commitments
no wonder ton is messed up and confused

ive said it multiple times but im convinced great is fixing all his mistakes in this second timelinethe one that involved the death of tonklas brother nan tyme and eventually his own even with an omniscient narrator theyre unreliable because the timelines arent clear they mix together and leave us confused
seeing jjs penis definitely wasnt on my bingo card though im not sure if it was his or a prosthetic and honestly im not sure if i want to know


though im not sure if it was his or a prosthetic
im here after 6 rewatches

this show and mostly korntonklawin is giving me brainrot like for the last 12 hours im reading theoriescommentsopinionsim going crazy obsessed comment image


i have those 3 pretty clocked
greattyme are my homework right now 
im loving the story a lot and i still dont have any theories lol however i do feel a bit odd about fuaiz with all of this sex scenes considering he just turned 18



you should definitely not watch this episode or this series or the prior 3 episodes and definitely do not look at the gifs on this post run go fast trying to save you so you can uphold your stance



earthmix 
edited because english eludes me

cause of death the heart killers 
what in the parallel universe


im not getting parallel universe vibes i think ton kla is having hallucinations like the cat in ep1
like  left and right 3 nc scenes and  turned 
nah im leaving 

come back we need to get lost in this maze together


late to the party but omg this episode
heir from a powerful family  why do i think korn killed tonklas brother
tonkla meeds therapy i hate this whole wintonklakorn situation feels icky who am i supposed to hate here 
sorry ive been gone for so long i had something urgent to take care of okay but tonklas brother was murdered and tonkla was left to manage it all alone you selfish fuck hate that he was literally just there for sex he didnt even bother asking about tonkla lowkey so exciting when he kicked korn out kinda feel bad for win hes so whipped and tonkla just doesnt know what he wants i mean besides a raw fuck 
omg who killed the cat tonkla is either a psychopath or its korn neither of them are giving very sane vibes korn killing everyone and everything close to tonkla so he has only korn to rely on or tonkla is a psychopath or has something like schizophrenia and isnt aware of what hes doing
side note sometimes when i look at tonkla at a certain angle briefly he looks like hyunjin
oh korn for sure groomed tonkla and tonkla loves him but has slowly realised over the years hes actually a massive lying cunny oh because he took over the family business makes total sense its always the family business turning people into simply the worst people poor tonkla still a side piece whilst korn is engaged to fasai i want to know the story there do you love him though korn
4 minutes being the amount of time the brain can survive without oxygen leads me to believe this entire thing is great having some sort of hallucination whilst he dies like maybe he really knows these people and wishes he did things differently and thats why he keeps imagining something different with the 4 minutes thing or maybe this whole thing is just a complete fantasy and none of these people are even connected
damn nan is really going through it no idea what her connection in all of this is yet but i feel bad shes clearly been tortured hope the guy who punched and kicked her dies xoxox
nah you dont get to be sad korn
the fact that they know it was great who got nan out is not going to bode well for his relationship with korn but it apparently gas for his relationship with thyme yeooooowwww lets go love that he doesnt even know where they are
the hairrrr the forehead kissssssss the giggles aw theyre so gentle i wonder if those leg tatts are real the comment that said their full sex scene was 4 minutes long  you just know theyre gonna backtrack on that next episode 
lol i forgot about this guy wait hold the fuck up theres two timelines going on here so he is tonklas brother and in that case it was title who killed him i am so so confused the plot thickens
next week needs to hurry up actually


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
yes those are bibles real tats on his thighs

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
fuaiz getting it again as he should
although theres so much sadness behind his actions it makes me feel bad



yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
dont stone me but it felt like great wasnt really showing enjoyment during the nc scene guess i was expecting more moans and visuals of him lost in bliss gasping for air
it was still incredibly sweet and soft and i liked that but with how hyped it was i was hoping to see something more idk aggressive or emotionally laden shocking etc not that emotions werent there but you get me
maybe its meant to be a slow burn in the nc department for tyme and great so lets see how far they take it maybe theyll surprise us


i think we were all expecting the scenes he keeps seeing in his memories and the one we all keep seeing in our minds from the trailer
so yes i was disappointed too again due to erroneous expectations not because the scene was bad also the whole prior scenes being about adrenaline also made me expectadrenaline fueled sex which this was not
so i think the expectations were not met given the hype and what we know the trailer and greats memories showed us and that adrenaline discussion prior to the scene

oh my god this show never fails  those tattooed thighs jfc although i was surprised how soft the tyme great scene was but im not mad
i have never been more confused and entertained im assuming its a different timeline situation i have no clue whats going on though im just enjoying the rideing


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
ill only get to watch this tomorrow help


first of all congratulations on ton kla for finally getting what he wants after 3 episodes also the boy needs some rest he is caring the 18 rating on his shoulders for way too many episodes now now that this is out of the way what if the seeing into the future thing is just great looking back on what he sees as his mistakes and trying to rectify them somehow creating like a fork in the timeline that sometimes seeps into the reality but it is not actually real i know i dont make much sense but this is what this series is doing to me comment image

soooooo the ending of episode 4 wtf is going on  i like a good bc scene like the rest but i need to know what great parents did to tymes parents qtna


annnndddd is anuwat is it title because where is he is he dead did title kill him sooo who did great save  dome is dead or nooooowho left the hospital what timeline are we in 


i am severely confused about a few things
first in tonklas flashback he and korn were already a couple but had never had sex so was that tonklas first time because how can they be a couple when korn didnt know basic things like tonkla has no experience in kissing so hes going to teach him how to do it but then they are like i love you so much help or having sex confessing and becoming a couple all happened in that day lol
is dome alive in the same dimension that tonkla is in or could it be that the influence of the 4 minutes has affected something because how come we see dome alive but tonkla and the inspector consider him dead

tonkla finally was fucked raw we celebrate that his dream came true
inspectors dong was out bro
who is mr anuwat warindej
the difference between two people who love each other korn and tonkla  at least in the flashback and ep1 and when one is only using the other tonkla to the inspector i really appreciate the quality of acting we are getting the dynamics are totally different and i can even feel the difference
my toxic trait of wanting more of tonkla and korn cause im living their chemistry fukkkkkk
i didnt expect tyme and great having sex this episode i dont know the timeline of their relationship is strange i feel we barely see them interact this episode and also tyme second agenda cause dude wants revenge so is he really into great or just playing him
edit word

all of this im so confused and so intrigued this show is great 
episode was overhyped probably the weakest to me but show is still 1110


overhyped nc wise however incredible progress to the plot in this episode

so did tonk get bred by the cop cause i didnt see a indication of a condom being put on


up me  come inside me so yes he got his wish


spoiler deeper thoughts on one specific scene
now that ive found the ween i am curious about tymegreat and their nc scene it was so missionary  so boring  did great even finish was it tymes first time with a man it wasnt passionate at all  the opposite of what i would expect postinsane rescue mission it was almost like great was directing tyme not in it for himself at all
very diff from tonwin and notfirsttime tonkorn
the tymegreat scene was almost grounding them stabilizing them vs revving things up
given how much thought boc gives and how many details there are this cant be a coincidence
figured out the spoiler issue  sorry


agreed it was boring and very much the opposite of adrenaline fueled sex not sure if doc was doing it to calm great down i just rewatched it for the 5th time and i just dont know if maybe jes was nervous af and bible has more experience in this realm and with pond intimacy director but yes it definitely looked like great was walking tyme through this i have had major adrenaline rushes where you are just insanely overstimulated laughing on the bed so i dont know how great went directly from that to being super calm and a teacher of the art of sex maybe this was tymes first time with a man the nurses said he had an ex girlfriend maybe great does boys a lot so he was teaching tyme the ways of the boys i dont know but yes i have been turning this over and over in my head and something doesnt fit 
so who wears it best love love love this top tho


love it
ucastlekd your boy appeared in the 4 minutes onairs 
saipon long beans oabplawan 
spy hands down also unwears it the best too


up until now everything appeared normalif one can consider seeing four minutes into the future as normal however the revelation that dome is ton klas brother complicates matters significantly he was the one great was supposed to have rescued in episode 2 from domes kidnapper and future murderer title yet he was found dead and cremated in this episode this raises intriguing possibilities are we witnessing two parallel worlds or are we experiencing greats mind while he is in a coma or perhaps during a heart attack
the possibilty of parallel worlds or alternate realities suggests a narrative that may blur the lines between what is real and what could be imagined or altered by the characters experiences
but it can also be something different i have untill now no idea do we see the events in the wrong order that dome is murdered after he had been saved by great
ton klas fingerprints are all over the murderweapon of the unknown victim how is win going to handle that he is madly in love with ton kla how is he going to hide that evidence from his superiors
additionally theres the bribed chief of win who has taken over domes case he seems to be under the influence of powerful individuals and win is being followed could titles family be behind this it hints at a deeper conspiracy which raises questions about power dynamics and who is pulling the strings behind the scenes
and what about nam is she possibly tymes sister or another victim of greats parents
thus far this episode has left us with more questions than answers it certainly pushes the boundaries of thai bl particularly with its daring portrayal of intimacy
as a dutch viewer i find that seeing a mans private parts in a tv series is not new to me i witnessed such depictions quite often in the eighties which now seems long past however it appears that thai bl or should i say boc has entered a boundarybreaking era
win is portrayed in a vulnerable light and ton klas experiences are depicted with raw honesty including the intimate scenes the tender deflowering of ton kla by korn in happier times highlights their deep affection for one another they once had
moreover the first encounter between great and tyme is particularly poignant possibly marking their first experiences with a man tymes concern for great is evident in his gentle gesturesa peck on the forehead a playful bite on the nosefollowed by a moment of anticipation as he waits for great to respond even then tymes gaze remains attentive ensuring that great is alright both in that moment and beyond
lukwa has been asked by dr den earlier from what aspect of life her ability to see 4 minutes in the future comes from cause he explained that what patienst having seen in the moment when they had a cardiac arrest depends on their beliefs religion experiences etc
when she stopped by dr den to give him some food and also to answer that question she has thought about it she beliefs she was in that place before ithan you see her in a white room it was in a art gallery and hear the explanation about 4 minutes the time the brains can survive without oxygen and the question what happens during that time to our consciousness her question is if that is why she thinks she can see 4 minutes into the future because of that number mentioned
dr den asks her when she was there but she cant remember exactly how and when she went in the art gallery vague memories but that she was not alone there there was another person in my opinion that can be no one else than great


i did like an hourlong thought exercise last night of what if dome lived came home and then was subsequently killed but when i played that out it didnt make sense that who murdered him would be such a mystery because theyd have a record of domes hospital visit great taking him there and also being injured and views police report of title kidnapping her there would be enough detail  people for win to easily put together title as a suspect so i dont think its the case that dome lived was released and then was subsequently killed

are we witnessing two parallel worlds or are we experiencing greats mind while he is in a coma or perhaps during a heart attack
i feel like going 2 timelines is getting extremely messy and its more like one route where someone is exploring the alternative options my current headcanon is that great is dying and considering all the choices he made that led him here eg he should have left the woman on the road or he should have run past tyme he shouldnt have saved nan etc
ton klas fingerprints are all over the murderweapon of the unknown victim
was that mentioned explicitly in the show i didnt actually connect that but we did see a scene of him bashing someone up could either be title for killing dome korn for stringing him alongor even dome he did look a bit psycho when we saw the cat scene
it might be title because the police mentioned that 2 people were killed the same way and it could be title killing dome and subsequently tong kla killing title win then meets tk and gets the call that his fingerprints are on the rock
do we see the events in the wrong order that dome is murdered after he had been saved by great
i did wonder that especially since theyre so concerned with the time that they never show us dates but i think its a little too coincidental that hes killing him in the exact same place and location
but that she was not alone there there was another person in my opinion that can be no one else than great
weve seen great have that vision before i think the fact that she realises he was there were the 2 of them dying at the same time or do all these people with visions enter the same realm
so many questions so little answers


we can keep talking about the nc scenes but guys the theories from what ive seen people believe that there are seperate timelines and great is stuck in a different timeline and all we will know about it more in the future coming eps but my god the series is so good so far everything about it is phenomenal



im here for fuaiz constantly getting dicked down honestly i kinda need him and bas to become a fixed pair
i havent seen it yet im so excited

ahhh i gotta watch this brb 



waah kudos to the writers im loving the plot twist
also bas needs to keep the hairstyle that we see in the fbs i mean he looks handsome both waysin that style even morefor me its always hair downhair up  bas is doing amazing here
also not to be rude but enough with tonkla ncs fuaiz needs a break from that many ncshes still a 19 yr old kidi feel old not to act like a moral police but boc couldve been a bit considerate of him or given him fast cut ncs more than this much explicit ncs he feels like the main character tho with complex storyline so lets dive into his brothers mystery hes also doing a great job
bas fuaiz bed talk was wow they look so much in love i loved it that soft fluffy moment
i dont mind greattyme thogive me more mystery along the way
winjj seems a bit heart broken
and korn situation is kinda sad his business changed him completely he lost himself even more
i love this show tho


bl drama enthusiast
can someone explain what is happening with the boy that got beat up and put in hospital is that tonklas brother and theres two parallel universes im so confused who tonklas brother is and how hospital boy fits in



apparently we have different time line now i tried to make a diagram here 
if i miss some important stuff please tell me guys ill correct my diagram


hospital boy is dome yes that is ton klas bro i think he is a hallucination of ton kla he is dead but ton kla is reimagining


cherry magic 
 also  and the  wasnt about the nc scenes itself it was because of  i saw no post about that  why 
and the tattooos 
okay okay lets try to put some words there  its just superb in every aspects suspens relationship development psychology photography 


lol it was implied up top where i said very explicit lol

bocs cinematography
i didnt mention dick at all because i had no idea until this second where

omg  great episode just great i really love how they show the different aspects of the characters every detail is a clue
since we are now sure we are dealing with different time lines i will need tab to keep track xd if i think its good enough ill post it


yes please share i am pretty positive the cop at his office and the phone call happens later than we think because eventhough cop helped at the funeral i dont see ton kla calling him just on a tuesday morning

i was waiting for tonkla to be dped 


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
im at the point where tyme fixes greats messy hair and i dont know if my heart is ready for whats about to ensue

just dont forget to breathe for the next 4 minutes


i have to say i am glad we got mad tonkla with korn most others will quick jump to the forgiveness but him kicking korn out was perfect i enjoy a good argument in series

all i have is questions
where is title was he one of the dead bodies
how did knowing greats surname influence tymes desire to get to knowget close to great was he genuinely attracted to great in the er since he hates greats family was his first goal to use great somehow in his revenge but then he reveals his face to great after going after korn and then great helps him so i guess hes decided great is ok after all
for the tymegreat nc scene i assume that jes already has a big fandom from all of the het dramas hes made it might be detrimental to his career to do fullon nc greats flashbacks seem more passionate than the one in this episode but i wont be surprised if their nc scenes are never as fullon as tonklakorn or tonklagreat i liked the lightheartedness of this scene and the developing connection it might have been the first time with a guy at least for both of them
my only issues with the all of the nc scenes so far is the timing they are shot as though we see everything from start to finish and yet the finish is within maybe 30 seconds i like that they are semirealistic tymes sweat was the icing on the cake but i would have preferred the illusion of longer sex scenes a time skip for some prep for getting comfortable for enough blood to be diverted to the important places for an orgasm to have some basis in reality lol
korn wants to prove himself to his father and goes along with the illegal stuff he hasnt commented on how he feels about it yet he wanted nan to be unhurt but doesnt have the authority to ensure that which says something about where the real power still is his father
i love how this series isnt wasting any time every scene every interaction is important


i am caught up and obsessed with this show now first off my favorite is ton kla idk if people have been complaining about his screen time but i dont care i love seeing him on screen hes so interesting to me especially the way his dynamic shifts from korn to win ooooh hes taking it the look he gives win just shows he has all the power in their relationship i love to see it
besides that i think hes going to have a really important part in the future especially since im not sure what hell do and what will go down when korn finds out the end scene though yup dome is definitely his brother but i wonder whats going on with the timeline cause we know dome is dead from ton klas pov but up till that last scene he was still alive idk i guess well have to see
also yay for greattyme getting together this ep at least physically lol


anyone else see that starting aug 24th with the 5th episode it will be in gagaoolala too

i can do it with a broken heart
here we go my incoherent thoughts and reactions as i watch this right now
so its pmor and nan but why and how i wonder oooh well that wasnt a surprise at all was it tyme trying to get back at greats family
ok im certain now tonkla and tyme will team up to get revenge because korn killed tonklas little brother or korns people did who cares
weirdly enough the uncut version is now searchable in viu in my territory indonesia but it says that youd need viu premium not just the regular premium and the only way to get it is by contacting their customer service i vaguely remember premium being available overthecounter a month ago so i assume theyre doing id check now i havent actually done it i guess its all because of this show i dont see anything else even remotely sexual


can you please tell me how many minutes does the uncut version have


i have so many questions  is tonkla in the other timeline where dome was killed by title or did great taking dome to the hospital not save him and hes in some kind of purgatory or are the timelines converging since great is changing so many things ngli have a feeling we are heading to a sad ending for our main couple tonkla finally got what he wanted and win is so pathetically in love with this boy 


or is this all just a dream of greats while hes dying in the hospital and when the clock strikes 1104 he dies



is anyone else having an error with the episode loading the vpn is connected i have the premium viu but im getting network error while downloading it wont let me attach the screenshot of the error though

who was the name at the beginning of this the murderer

anuwat which was shown to be tonklas name on the booklet that was handed out at the 4 minutes fanmeet

as a lurker of this subreddit i am forever grateful i just started watching this

welcome welcome thank you for coming up for air heh


im so glad for these unhinged on airs because im not able to actually watch the show my own stubborn refusal to figure out a vpn and pay for yet another streaming service at least i get to know whats happening from you all

can i ask why this episode was rated 21


i am still piecing together theories on this i feel like im going to have to rewatch everything once it ends to see how it fits i think im watching multiple linear timelines and they connect somehowwe just havent gotten to that point yet like there is a gap in the before and after or the parallel
the nc scenes are so informative i feel like we get a lot of emotional feedback from how they all interact with one another i will not complain about the great tyme scene i feel like it came across as natural even if it was missing something idk the tenderness was not something i was expecting to see given all the other nc scenes thus far i think their kissing scenes are very well done its definitely a visual feast thighs tattoos on a man in an intimate setting is something ive never seen in person i must say it was sexy the checkins the physical touch eye contact came across as soft and vulnerable even though it felt slightly detached for me towards the end but i liked that about it i feel like it was deliberately done
im going to watch ep 5 tomorrow cant wait i have a feeling that korn is going to catch tonkla and win together at some point and i am not sure if i am ready to see how that falls out so much to anticipate

i want to watch 4 minutes uncensored where is the resources
any one can tell me where to watch the ep 4  i tried to watch it on the plataform viu but i couldnt

can someone kindly enlighten me im literally so confused right now i thought tonkla brother was supposed to be alive based on ep 2 like didnt great turn back time or smt and saved him wtf now hes dead in ep4 someone pls explain to me i literally went back to rewatch ep 2 im srsly so confused

is anyone else just getting an unexpected error every time they try to watch on viu im using express vpn to thailand and no matter what i do it just keeps giving me an error

soooooo i just came from facebook and someone posted a pic of win coming from out of the room after tonkla told whats his name to leave the housebruh he came out with no pants on and no underwear like i was staring at the pic for dang near 2 mins to realize what was in the pic and yooooo this manhishis weewee was out just out like i was not expecting to see penis   in the show 

i still havent started watching but my jaw is on the floor with each gif i see here goddamn i need to start watching soon 


havent started watching this one yet but bro these men are firejust dropping hubby off at work things 

fr i was like is there gonna be a goodbye kiss cause thats what married couples do 

yes theyre married already father inlaw mr rogers cant keep them apart 

so hot


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
how did i never notice what a fine ass bible has when he was in kinnporsche was i just blinded by his fine face

boc kept it a secret

enjoy and prepare your self for the end 

it was sad he had to see his mom die


agreed although its kinda what i was expecting i was expecting it later for some reason


so far everything has been in line with what many predicted and the photos jes posted this morning honesly were helpful to me in preparing for that ending 



maybe a girl can hope the shooting happening so early means we dont have bible dead in the end and time moves forward once hes saved  wishful thinking probably maybe next week we start 4 minutes for tyme 
is no one gonna get w dr den hes so big and hot and cute such a waste

lukwa should claim him theyd be cute together


bocs cinematography
i agree their smiles are so cute though the doctor patient thing but oh well this isnt real
boc better give job some love in a future series

is she really his patient or just a patient from the hospital he invited to question for his research im not sure but also yeah who cares 


dr den be looking like theb burj khalifa someone climb this man

love bible commitment to die or almost in every project he does


another parallel is that he needed to deal with grandmas in both series 

arent entirely accurate
so is this never happening im distraught 


hence why the guitar was making me distraught and why i cried when i saw the guitar cause omfg whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy did they waste time with guitars before he got shot ugh now we need to deal with trauma
however i did read the rules for the finale screening and it says the same thing as ep4 about 18 so i am hopefully we will get that scene at some point and it is not just flashes

im actually screaming that poor guitar he just wanted to be played
18 for the finally weve gotten so much already but i want to b greedy 

wait noooo i will riot if not still 3 eps to go 
i am wondering if there is a separate timeline for tyme because at the end we see flashes of him with blood on his nose and we know that he gets shot at some point so it might be that it happened in that timeline as opposed to this one idk

omg wait at the start of the 1st episode we see tyme get shot so are we the audience living out both tyme  greats not entirely accurate memoriesexperiences in jumbled order

i was just saying this in another comment but it occurred to me that we could actually have 3 timelines  a the original b greats and then c tymes because weve now seen tonkla seemingly kill title in two different timelines if we assume that the person he killed in the beginning scene of one of the eps a few weeks ago was also title since they didnt show it to us
but yeah i definitely think there are at least two and we must get to see them somehow because theres both the bar scene  the pool table etc and i dont see how those could happen after the events so far lol
another possibility that someone on twitter pointed out is that maybe great relives it again but this time tries to save things differently i guess well see


yk what i think when tyme would be shot we might see him reliving his memories for 4 mins wtf
the black and white color coding between great and tyme is a bit too heavyhanded for my taste
but damn bible is styled so well in this series every article of clothing he wears sits on his body just right

the black and white color coding between great and tyme is a bit too heavyhanded for my taste
its so on the nose it has to mean sth right 


agreed but also yes bible looks stunning i tagged on the post an insta account that keeps track of every bible outfit in the series and in all the photoshoots

i can do it with a broken heart
i think depending on where we are in the timeline greats white clothing is gradually mixed with black so the further down the unraveling if the mystery we get the more black hes wearing but thats just me and my addled brain at 140 am
thai mr rogers is so bad omg 


bocs cinematography
this scene was so fucking tense i actually found it more tense than any of the threatening scenes with kinn in kinnporsche mr rogers is the real mafia boss right here

grandma looked like she needed a diaper change stat everytime he smiled i got the heebiejeebies 
him saying ptyme is so cute


i think i can safely speak for a lot of us and say omg wtf 

def so

now why the hell is this show only 8 episodes you mean to tell me yall can wrap it all up in the next 3 eps
i feel like we only just started act 2 of a multiact series i wonder why they didnt push for at least 12 episodes theres so much more stories to tell
aww how can peeps not see korns heart hes willing to do all the bad stuff so great can just live a normal life he loves his bb brother so much 


i saw his heart i believe him to be good inside finally
i really love his characterization so far any other similar character like korn would have completely descended into evil by episode 2 or 3 but were more than halfway through and were still second guessing if hell be the final villain at the end or not
its great that they show how he genuinely loves tonkla and deeply cares for great we love a complex character

from the first episode i could tell hes a good guy and he puts up with a lot and is more than willing to put up with it for the people he loves 


cause of death the heart killers 
today it happened i felt his heart breaking when faisai refered to tonkla as that boy his eyes told me he wasnt just a boy for him

doesnt matter if hes getting his brother happy by destroying someone elses life  keep that shit to urself tbh the fact lorn knew that gambling thing harmed some ppl and said it was for the company tbh fck him as well i thought he was better  the entire family can rot in hell atp 

i love korn and where theyre taking his character you can really feel how impossible it is for him he cares about people and wants to love them he also wants to prove himself to his father but hes really been put in an impossible situation he cant have both


clearly i have been doing camping wrong all my life
also i decided to go back and watch ep 14 because it wasnt available in my area and the subs i found were horrible i figured proper translation might help the story a bit
i totally forgot about the opening scene with tyme being shot hes wearing the same clothes as the end of ep 5 this is where binging everything all at one time helps you dont forget details from a month ago
update well after starting the rewatch to figure out what i missed
iqiyi is not showing the sultrier version at least not on the app on my roku tv
where exactly was the black cat with tonkla in the beginning
update to my update
iqiyi does have the sultrier version i went to watch ep 5 within 10 minutes of it being released and there was only one option now they are both there my bad operator error
i found the cat it was a blink and you miss moment


or watching every episode 10 timesi recognized the clothes right away maybe next week we get tymes 4 minutes vs greats from 14


i couldnt really rewatch them that much the versions i was finding were ads every few minutes and had horrible translations usually grace instead of great she instead of he and completely missing full sentences


3 things after that episode
why is this series only 8 episodes 
im confused
bible  helllooooooo


what time stamp was 

is this a clue


sammon supervising


ive noticed that a lot of these authors are really young im not sure why i always assumed they would be older epi 5 is airing tomorrow and not today right

are we finally getting a few answers today  that we might have already
but whats up with the dometonkla stuff so all the seeing into the future stuff great flipping the script on title etc was greats not entirely accurate experiencesmemories but then why was ghost dome in an uber going home like whats good thats so sad  lol


the cat in ep1 told me they had to be hallucinations

omgg wait that makes sense he hasnt fed it again or worried about it at all lmao
ok i just finished the episode and i was caught off guard when great was with his mom  also it took me a good min to realize that time had blood on his nose as well makes me wonder what happened in the other timeline


also it took me a good min to realize that time had blood on his nose as well



this episode was the most tense omg
never felt at ease like the past ones not even in the most peaceful scenes
i can say that what everything happened in this episode was about to happen soon or later
still im still wow after ive seen it

i am so  after that episode
like
still trying to absorb everything we saw and howwhether it makes sense


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
i demand more shy bottom bible

i demand it too i need giggly bible again


bocs cinematography
holy fucking shit
im willing to eat crow about korn bass facial acting during his scene with fasai where she said hed have to marry her  damn the way he swallowed down his feelings for tongkla because he knew he was painted into a corner jesus it hurt so much that i felt it lodged in my throat too that was him killing his love for tongkla to save his familys reputation bro its not worth it
is title fasais brother the cold openings obviously arent in chronological order so we are seeing how tongkla must have gotten title before he killed him i assume one thing im curious about is if win actually knew about tongklas fingerprints on the rock before he went to help him with domes funeral that phone call he got during that one cold open could have been when tongkla was asking for help so maybe weve kind of been misinterpreting some of the looks on wins face obviously he has feelings for tongkla but maybe theres more conflict there because he knows hes fallen for a murderer and is either trying to cover it up and thus be just as corrupt as his boss or trying to get close to tongkla for evidence i dunno  i feel like there is more going on to that relationship than meets the eye just a hunch
jesus so great went back in time to save his mother and it didnt fucking matter she died anyway the actor playing his mom did such a good job in that scene all the women were spectacular this episode nan was great and so was manee just the rage she had inside of her bubbled out of her gaze too bad it was the wrong side of the family that got killed
there was no sense of calm in this episode everything was on a knifes edge that dinner scene at tymes house was so tense even when they were at that gorgeous campsite it felt like a dream but one you know youre going to wake up from and its going to be total shit when you do wake up so its not even comforting and it all just became a nightmare for great as soon as he kissed tyme goodbye in the car everything in his life fell through his fingers he and korn fought and korn blocked him tyme was threatened and ditched him at least from greats pov his familys foundation was built on a pile of shit and then he tries to save his mom from dying and she dies anyway and now hes on deaths door  fuck i love this show
this blue shirt that tyme is wearing is the shirt he was wearing when he got shot in the beginning of episode 1 so are we going to see tymes 4 minutes now will this show end where they are both just dead and korn marries someone he doesnt love and the man he loves goes to prisonis executed for killing the son of a prominent and dangerous man honestly i would kind of love that i know that everyone wants happy endings but i kind of love that with dff and now this sammon is just like fuck your happy ending hahahaha queen behavior
edit perhaps the campground that great just found without knowing where it was is purgatorylimbo and they are both dying they both want to stay there but cant i said above its like a dream you dont want to wake up from but maybe thats literal this is the last place they can be together


cherry magic 
one thing im curious about is if win actually knew about tongklas fingerprints on the rock before he went to help him with domes funeral
same i was wondering if win knew
perhaps the campground that great just found without knowing where it was is purgatorylimbo and they are both dying they both want to stay there but cant
the black and white clothes and the fact that nothing is moving there even trees there is not wind no animal no time no other people all those facts make the scene dreamy and not real at all so i kind of share that idea of purgatory or at least a place where their visionconsciousness merge together
okay so my incoherent thoughts
i was really not expecting the end of this episode because tbh i thought that we wouldnt see the scenes where tyme  great get hurt until the last episode but now its already happened for great which has kind of thrown that idea on its ear haha but every time i think i know what to expect for next week i am thrown for a loop
i am tentatively wondering if the other timeline that we see flashes of is tymes timeline we see him with blood on his nose at the end and then without just like we saw tonkla with and without dome in the last episode weve known all along that there are different versions of events but now i am wondering if whats going to happen is that now were going to see tymes version perhaps ep 6  7 tell the story from that timeline and then ep 8 wraps everything up
i find it really interesting how we see a contrast in passitivity from korn vs great actively choosing action in all his changes korn feels helpless and as though he has no way out even though there are likely choices available to him if hed just take them he doesnt though which just leads to him getting mired deeper
i really really hope that this wraps up well because theres so much going on i appreciate how much sammon packs into her shows but theres the lady and her son theres nan and her friend theres kornwintonkla and then theres tyme and great but on the other hand now that we kind of know the overarcing plot i guess now we have three episodes to solve it but im worried that theres still even more going to be packed in and that its going to be a kind of unsatisfying ending
i also cant help but wish that we had more time with tyme and great this episode was 48 minutes and i feel like they could have added another ten minutes or so and had some more time for them out at the campsite thing
we will never be safe from a guitar scene in thai bl lol
im locked innnnnn and i swear this pic boc is using is tulkan im losing my mind 


i hate guitars so much though 



the guitar annoyed me but what really set me off was tyme talking about not being happy it might be a translation issue but it doesnt sound good from any angle ive explored
great would be justified in literally kicking him out of the hammock they had just spent a steamy night together that is the kind of moment you are supposed to say cheesy stuff like until i met you to avoid hurting your lovers feelings
tyme hurt great again in the same scene with his i have nothing to lose line im surprised that great kept his cool after that remark

okay honestly i am usually a certified guitar hater x1000 but i actually didnt mind it here like i thought the gentle song was kinda cute and added to the dreamysurreal feeling of the camp site like they got transported and are suddenly inhabiting a cute bl sceneset somehow in the middle of their shared nightmare

lmao

holy fucking shit guys omfg prepare for the ending of this episode read the warnings i posted up top if you need to ask me questions about the warnings before you go in if you are scared to go in jesus christ

8 episodes feels too short for this series im worried its going to be a rushed ending thats not really satisfying 

well damn

ifylita 1 fan 


its like all of us are deadbut without the zombieskorn has the weight of the world on his shoulders that he has to trade the love of his lifehe doesnt want to disappoint his fatherhe wants to protect greathe wants to love tonkla freelyyoure boxed in the corneris fasai really the only way outassassins in the templesuicidal lady who jumped in front of greats car was not randomif he did not save her he would have saved his mother a vicious cyclei hope great and tyme survives thisotherwise it will be a very sad sad ending


bocs cinematography
anyone else getting a network error from viu when they try to get to the 4 minutes landing page

im fairly sure that viu has now blocked vpns since its available on other platforms internationally i ended up watching on iqiyi


yall i loved todays episode like i liked it better than the all episodes so far so that means great was just reliving his memories in those four minutes and what could be have done differently none of it was real shit it makes sense but i do have a lot of questions like going by this theory if that woman that great saved supposedly died in the real world then who sent the goon to kill his family 

i cant even form thoughts on this series anymore i almost just wanna go into it surprised without any theories 
so tonkla is def gonna kill title bc he knows thats who killed his brother but also hes still alive in another timeline wtf
i still dont like korn tbh i get that hes stuck but he could do the right thing and even if he needs to get married to that woman he doesnt need to actually romance her and kiss her hand like that lol shes calling tonkla is boy toy but shes basically using korn as hers
im glad we got more greattyme but at what cost  

also greats conversation with korn reminded me of the story the ones who walk away from omelas by ursula k le guin
its about a utopian society that secretly relies upon the utter suffering of one child but when the citizens find out about this they have a choice to remain in the paradise or to leave and never come back
great is like the ones who walk away because they dont want to live in a place that is made from someone else suffering


great is like the ones who walk away because they dont want to live in a place that is made from someone else suffering
i would walk too like how do you even sleep at night dude


 ep5 is live on gaga
 ep 5 is live on iqiyi
i linked it up top too


just wondering why boc ended their exclusive deal with viu and made it available everywhere and we are already half way through they should have done this at the beginning is it because theres a glitch in viu thailand i could not get in there i am redirected and none of their videos are playing sad they did not anticipate the popularity of their product hope they fix it soon since there goes another premium subsc


it was set up for exclusivity for 4 eps gaga gave a hint on aug 6 that they would get it after that deal
viu gave them more money to be exclusive

yoooo waiiit you mean to tell me we had to sit through a guitar scene in such a good show why 


1 guitar scene and 1 threatening guitar scene where they just showed us the guitar like it could be played any minute it was so hard


not very demure am i using it right 

no sexy time but still awesome why is that scene in the beginning look like their honeymoon tho
my new theory is that this is like triage theyve lived through all of this before and the visions great has been seeing is their previous go around or at least thats one of my theories 


earthmix 
im as confused as the beginning lol but this is so good i was owed a morning after though we deserve it at this point im obsessed with these two they have clicked so well that i hope we get to see them work again in the future i cannot believe we are just three episodes away from the finale im not ok


welcome to my ted talk everyone been dead thats the end hope yall enjoyed


what a tense episode like a quiet on the edge of your seat kind of tense
do we know how korns mom died was she sick of was she pushed out to make room for greats mom aka the mistress who got the gambling den off the ground and worked hard to get her and her son out of the shadows  her pushing korn into the illegal side of the business to make room for great to take over the clean side oof
i want so bad for korn to just let the familyfamily business go up in flames put yourself first korn
hard agree with the comments that suggest the campsite being purgatorylimbo everything just felt too calm too still too peaceful now does white represent death or does black 
with the shot heard around the world things seem to be getting ready to wrap up but in three episodes feels like this should be a ten episode series not eight 
i am confused
i held my breath and ff with the intense stuff
i am confused

so what we followed was greats memories and the mistakes he wished to erase it seems the first version of events where the real ones and dome is in fact rip makes sense he was looking to the past with the knowledge of the future lets see what we get from now on exciting i dont believe we will have a hea with this oneughhhhi should have knowni was not strong enough to avoid starting to watch it now we suffers2g


me sympathising with korn is pretty much on brand  why am i like this


so greats mom heads the investment scam she was the primary target by the temple hitmanshe was saying how she worked so hard to get where they are if not for her hard work they would still live in a small house somewhereso she was the mistress even before korns mom died i deducekorns and greats age are not that far apartdid great grew up sheltered and cuddledeven older stepbro korn wants to let him live his carefree life and korn will do everything himsefwhy does he have a diffrent moral compass than the rest of his familyis it his inherent characteris this why he didnt blink an eye on what dr tyme revealed and instead readily helped dr tymeor was it because he was dying and wished to change the outcome to save his mother

im still confused
probably more so now
wtf is happening
like i get it but i dont
bless the breeze always a sight to behold

them looking at each others lips before the cute kiss 


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
guitar scenes make me cringe


same thankfully this was short but not gonna lie when they showed me the guitar again by the picnic table i did scream wtf no not again stop it

hmm so her son aint nobody interesting
me hoping that either he knows how to play that thing or the guitar is just for the photos


the way i screamed when i saw that guitar last night  i honestly would have been less horrified if they had confirmed that both may be dead honestly this morning when jes and bible sort of confirmed that great is in fact having a heart attack i was calmer than when i saw that horrible guitar

he can play the guitar and drums
he has videos on his instagram where he plays and sings

so am i the only one the show isnt showing up in iqiyi for
oh also who was the lady at the temple the other person who sees in the future

the woman who got hit by greats car in the beginning
that was crazy good  i am so excited for next weeks episode 


ok i thought we would have answers in this episodes and it was just more questions
i would never have thought they would dare to kill great so soon of course he will come back somehow but we thought that this was the new timeline and he ended up almost dying like the original one or this was the original one
greats murder was ordered by the woman he saved oh delicious irony as rumor says the road to hell is paved with good intentions
by the way the guy who killed great here is the same who killed tyme in the first episode
httpsxcomevulienka3status1827037367301284032
den says that one of possible effects of cardiac arrest is fix their mistakes and having supernatural powers so we cant discard the fantasy element here
i think its pretty confirmed that tonkla killed title in revenge for his brother

greats murder was ordered by the woman he saved oh delicious irony
maybe its more like karma is a bitch and no one can escape her since originally great committed a hit and run on that poor woman i mean hes trying to make things better but somehow it still ends up a shit pile or its like in triage where the mc needs to find the right thing to change otherwise the ml just keeps on dying over and over again


yes

i thought maybe pre credits were running in order but that would mean tonkla killed someone else with a rock
dr den who draws circles for some reason said that when patients have a cardiac arrest they relive past experiences some have supernatural powers some go back to fix past mistakes and some get a fresh start with those they love patients experiences feel real but arent entirely accurate if we just watched great go through this with only a minute left im with the guesses that tymes 4 minutes are next and it will be a different version of events there has to be a reason weve seen things flash and change and then go back like the thai tea that said dont forget to treat your wound to im sorry great and back what really happened and why is manee hiring a hit man after greats family
the beginning seemed out of place why are they having a chilled picnic with everything going on lol great said he wishes he could stay forever but probably cant and tyme singing a song with the lyrics  if we could meet again my heart will still give it to you ill remember this day those memories forever to meet in the land of twilights veil in a world where time stands still its very ominous
i think id love any ending with this show its just too good 


great said he wishes he could stay forever but probably cant and tyme singing a song with the lyrics  if we could meet again my heart will still give it to you ill remember this day those memories forever to meet in the land of twilights veil in a world where time stands still its very ominous
in this entire part i was saying
they are both dead fuck omg they are both dead this is not reality they are in some limbo place dead or dying and this is where their subconscious took them
i can do it with a broken heart
noooow im caught up with everyone else lets see rubs hands together


i can do it with a broken heart
noooow im caught up with everyone else lets see rubs hands together
i wonder if tyme will come clean with great also i wonder if great realises korn probably did all the dirty work to shield his baby brother i love how tyme is wearing all black and great is wearing all white its almost as if theyre trying to tell us something
those beasts
can someone tell me what the difference between the cut and sultrier version was this week i definitely watched the sultrier version but was curious

their wasnt any sultrier scenes this episode so i guess not that much difference 


copying from a reply i made on another outlet im just going to accept that every theory i have is wrong and every idea i can think of is only part of the whole story i love how this keeps me on my toes i love puzzles and usually figure stuff outbut this one makes me feel stupid until the end which i usually have to make myself do so i dont give away the story for anything else i read or watch but figuring this out and still seeing something coming out of left field and not knowing how it impacts everything else i think i already know is incredible
these characters are becoming so much more than 2d every time i watch an episode i learn something new whether it be backstory motive emotionsand its all tying into a greater plot i cannot wrap my head around loving it so far


no more tonkla nc the comment section is dead this episode whoever was complaining about too much screen time for tonkla count your days


oh now i get it the woman that great hit  she paid for hitman that was moonlighting as a budhist priest very smart she did her big one revenge for her son i did feel bad for greats mum though she loves him regardless and he was being a brat


i feel bad that great had to watch her die right in front of him but she had done some terrible things in her life korn and especially his dad are still roaming around

  


can anyone tell me how long the sultry version of this ep is im having trouble finding out if im watching the right version or not


i too am confused

4811

im so confused ep 4 last scene we saw that guy tonklas bro was still alive and this episode it felt like im watching a whole new drama so many things happened and went above my head wym great died tbvh i dont think he can die thay easily he is the main character so many questions why did that guy shot him and his mom did his dad order who was he what was that lady praying for what was the purpose  i know she is somehow connected to this murder situation like she knows someone is gonna die n stuff after that paper with those words also i didnt expect tyme to be that selfish  man took the 5m and went on or maybe theres something mroe we dont know yet idk why i have a feeling theyre rushing the series why is it just 8 episodes man


tyme accepted the money for the gangsters to leave his grandmother alone i guess they would have killed both of them in the house if he did not accept
the lady at the shrine is the same lady from episode 1 from the car accident she gives money to an assassin to kill greats parents because they were responsible for her sons death the guy that shot graeat and his mom is the assassin from the shrine in the real timeline the lady died after the car accident so i guess the shrine scene happened before she was hit by great

im glad theyve clarified the general plot as this point but i still have questions
so exactly what is real and what was not i thought the 4minute explanation meant that people were hallucinating about going back in time to fix their mistakes that would imply that great saved the woman in the first place and thats how she managed to hire the hit man to kill himhis mom so is he trying to leave her there so she never comes after him
also in the first scene great ran away from tyme and later changed it so that he met tyme instead so does it mean the first time he never really met tyme at all or that he wished he drove away instead of coming back to save his mom
i get what theyre implying but the mechanics are still confusing to me or maybe im just reading too deep into this


i love this show wow the story is mind blowing its so unpredictable and the writing is soooo goood sammon nd the screenwriters did an amazing job and the actors i loooovvvveee iittt


i really need korn  his mommy and daddy to be killed by the end of this series no stupid redemption or forgiveness nonsense


im confused when he saw the future the mom wasnt shot until he was in the car when he got back to reality she was still begging him to apologize to his dad when he got shot every other incident lined up in his future visions but not this one and he didnt even change anything 


question are all episodes on gaga and iqiyi uncut versions


gaga should be uncut

the eighth sense  semantic error  atots  moonlight chicken
iqiyi has both versions at least in the uk


as much as i dont like korn i sympathise with him as he has gone through a lot and his the oldest son so he has to take up a lot of work given by his father with a lot of expectations i get why korn feels like everything is blamed on him his father is a piece of shit and his stepmother sees her son as he cannot do no wrongsup dad
im screaming


i dont know why but this scene took me out i almost spat out my matcha  bible and his english strikes again

literally i wasnt paying attention and then when i heard it i was choking 


the way he just casually sup broed his dad when they were just beefing dad was like im not your bro with that paper toss lol

i wish he knew before he went in to see his dad cause i wanted his to be sassy about it lolol

tea

when i saw this is was like you know what i like this version of him like for a slight second in this scene i thought he was vegas again cause damn  he wanted it on of 

ikr i literally screamed that his vegas is showing

hes such a hot bitch i love it 


hes drinking a negroni is this now the official drink for hot messes in thai bl
this whole scene and the switch of the dynamic was truly phenomenal 

4 minutes will go down in history 

the unexpected tenderness tho even great was shooketh 


thats why he was obsessed afterwards no one in their right mind goes back for more after revenge porn

yeah he was dickmatized in a loving way and that was probably a first

jes uploading this episode to viu and gaga himself 


he is competing with you 

omggg the lifthop up and crawl 

its going down in the bl history books if only they had continued to the end there


that bathroom break pissed me off did great go to douche or something

he definitely went to prepare but its the one time we dont want realism 
on a pool table  with the 4
screaming tbh this great characterization fits the way he dresses and his lifestyle a lot more than the dreamy version great wants for himself


a thousand percent now the clothes match
i brightened up this part specifically 


need to do a taste test of the goods first never skip this step
help me jesus

this is what enjoying the bible is all about



i am at work and unfortunately cannot watch till later im walking outside on my lunch break and stopped dead in my tracks at this good lord they are gonna kill me 

it seems like thats pponds mission 
i love how peeps thought fuaiz was doing the edgier scenes because hes young and dumb and new and boc is taking advantage of him etc but ppond cackled and said we all float down here billy boy bible is gonna let yall know real soon 
im actually getting really hype for shine mileapo are gonna go scorched earth 

literally expected bible to shake his hair out like a pantene commercial 


they lost their chance for shampoo product placement
cmon people leverage what youve got
not a gigantic marble lazy susan the wealthy just live different 


it is such a weird setup
nobody can reach the center of the table the cleaning staff probably dusts it using a swiffer to reach the center
marble is a terrible material for dining tables it is easily scratched and very porous the porous nature makes it soak up stains like a sponge the process for removing stains from marble is quite involved you need to make a poultice mixture that has both liquid and solid components the liquid component penetrates the marble to dissolve the stain the solid component needs to be more absorbent than the marble to draw everything back out


me reading this detailed explanation of marble maintenance

i can do it with a broken heart
i love how i can learn something competently random in the unlikeliest places

just impractical rich people nonsense doing stuff because they can 

ppond said why yes i am a qaf stan tyme taking a bite out of crime screaming 
tyme you nasty for this but lmao  all greats condoms meanwhile ton wats to be bred 247 

ton is a raw food connoisseur 

you know how we have pdeeeeaaaaannnnnn until we meet again and hiiiaaaaaaaa both cutie pie and between us now i will never hear the word raw without thinking of tonklas sex scenes anymore even when im eating sushi ill be thinking of him

bocs cinematography
omg i fucking love this soooo so so many people say i would never do that in this situation and think they would be a big hero in whatever tragedy they read about in the news but they never would be great was seeing visions of himself as being a good person but we see that he wasnt hes a murderer and an accomplice to a second murderer everyone wants to be the hero in their own story and will lie to themselves about it wow great is such a grey complex character
okay so why does jet look so hot splattered in blood titles a fucking dick but still heyyyyyy
jes and bibles ass curves could crumble empires jesus
i love that great was turned on that tyme was trying to fuck over his father
you let someone die because of your cowardice correction great let 3 people die because of his cowardice
okay so what was korn doing when tyme was first spying on him he definitely was doing something that involved bloodshed
through the whole episode i was wondering how tongklas story was going to fit into this damn
mannnnnnnnnnn now i need to go back and watch all the other episodes because this gives new context to everything its just like dff all over again how is mr ascot going to fit into this
omg here we goooooooo

i can do it with a broken heart
heres me praying for the bts and just betting jes bumped his head at least once

my jaw dropped with his entry
the eyeroll bitch  this is so real great was not looking to get fuxxord on this night and has to get ready help


thyme so sassy why u rolling your eyes when your bottom needs to prep
i cant breathe

i cant get over this moment wasnt tyme lowkey hating great i get the angry focking with purpose but this was anything but and no one can convince me of the opposite like did he have to hold his face oh so gently and go into that kiss so passionately as if greats mouth holds all the answers to all of his questions worldshattering sigh

i think it all just comes down to tyme likes pretty things and regardless of how he feels underneath it all or his ulterior motives he can appreciate that great is so pretty and in a different lifetime tyme would be so down 

me tyme might be conflicted and not 100 sure about his feelings cause he might start seeing something in great
imomen he just likes pretty things lets be honest
me yeah im def delulu
someone turn on the lights gotdamn 


isnt that your job 

i first didnt see who commented and was like just wait imomen is going to do it and then saw your comment and was like oh its imomen



this made me cackle  we are all imomen stans here 


this is the rich bitch great i was expecting negl i could hear him thinking watch it fucker 


what i loved was this episode makes the tymegreat nc scene in ep 4 make more sense and is even sweeter now great clearly fell hard for tyme and in his little purgatory existence he imagined that precious awkward tent moment as their first time instead of what really happened drunk after a bar more feral sex great is actually a puppy at heart but we also get to see the real him in ep 6 i love sammon this is so true to how complex humans actually are and how we view ourselves vs reality
i didnt love kinnporsche sorry folks so i wasnt into bible but i love him with jes i can feel sammon all over this too it reminds me so much of manner of death which is a fave of mine jes reminds me of tul
anywho excuse me while i go rewatch minutes 1523 again even taking out the nc scenes im really enjoying this show


i like this version of great way better than the first half lol this one is bolder confident aura

this version of great is a terrible person and desperately unhappy though ill take the first lol
yas bad bitch great era is everything 
omg

lmao
werq bitch brothers avenging their brothers deaths seems to be a big theme for a lot of sammons writing for boc and honestly im here for it
when the music started i was screaming 
this is so cute  they found love in a hopeless place 


god i loved this moment
bible is at his best here
and another huh reaction was born lol



i felt kinda sad at the end of this episode i kinda liked nice great who isnt real then it also pretty much confirms that none of the characters are going to get a happy ending
edit and tyme and greats relationship i liked the fake time line much better 


omg just great episode i love this side of great but can we all agree that hes clearly depressed and only acts like that because he wants attention   remember the scene when he was talking about how unhappy he is and the meds he takes and whatever happens in real life or his reminiscence during his heart attack great got shot anyway xd
such a great episode  now were finally arriving in the present to see what is happening for the first scene of episode 1
like the few last time i tried to create a diagram with the main event i hope it will help someone
helpppppp
cute greats already in protect me mode w tyme lol
i loved this messed up version of great when he drove away from a hit and run we knew he wasnt a good guy but i still didnt expect this side of him im sad the nc scene wasnt continuous gotta get that durex ad in and by lack of fuaiz again i did think it was great reliving memories but changing things im just wondering if tyme is also is this limbo place with great so their cute dates did happen but not in the real world or is it all in greats imagination theres a scene when tyme gives great a coffee cup but the message changes on it to im sorry great so my thoughts are that they are both in this limbo place
i guess next week we will see what happened to tyme would tonkla have a reason to hunt him down is win protecting tonkla do we think things still have to go down between korn and tonkla too its torture waiting another week 


i think win gave kla a heads up i think he is protecting him

i think so too that boy is in love also he didnt look very shocked when they couldnt find tonkla he was like oh noooo 

well well well i am at the point that i have just decided to trust that i will i understand it by the end and im officially going to stop trying to work it out
great episode great nc cutie pie moments that were a good contrast and a compelling mystery i think it is the best show on air at the moment certainly one of the best of this genre


does anyone else panic about the cats fate if great dies
genuine question here  are the nc scenes actually worth watching in terms of adding to characterization andor plot i dont particularly find nc scenes all that interesting if there are no feelings involved so i skipped them as soon as i realized tymes motivations
im really curious to see the fandoms reaction to tymes action with the video because the reaction in dff was intense to say the least greats reaction also made me so sad because it shows how little he values himself the sexual promiscuity the drinking basically going along with whatever happens around him  this is a boy who doesnt really care what happens to him
ngl after both dff and now 4 minutes i am kind of glad that boc is going to do a sitcom because they appear to have developed an allergy to having any real romance or love in their bl i have an appreciation for real life themes but i also dont mind some actual romance and love yknow the prior episodes were sweet but knowing it was all fake kind of ruins it and strips their meaning away
realizing that tyme most likely hates great was a stark contrast in comparison to greats fantasy of the last few episodes not only has he been making himself a better person hes been imagining a world where tyme was actually interested in him and liked him which kind of makes it extra tragic
at this point i am mostly interested to see what happens from here there must be flashbacks from tyme i am guessing so i am curious to see what he will change perhaps he regrets the video i hope so as remorse should really be depicted with that heavy of a topic
i will say though  i do like that they made tyme absolutely terrible as well like he goes after great for the sole reason of creating revenge porn and then turns his back on safety for his grandmother for the sake of his quest for revenge  but judges great for his very human response to danger greats no innocent himself but tymes got himself on a white horse he deserves to be knocked down off of
now to see how this all wraps up in the next two episodes at this point i am kind of assuming that tonkla korn great and tyme all die but im side eyeing boc for their promo picture for the final episode lol


im going to play devils advocate and say that great isnt inherently evil troubled yes its a direct result of his family dynamics he goes along with whats hes told to do because hes to afraid to rock the boat when he meets tyme hes finally able to start taking a stand
so as expected w sammons writing everything is explained in a real world way seems like no timelines no powers etc just great and tyme experiencing near death and in his mind wanting to go back and make things right etc
sammon  ppond cackling rn lol

thats insane but also bible wichapas sumettikul the actor you are 


i knew it bible as a baddie is so much hotter though  i like it



oh god i loved this episode the best one
great what a brat bastard coward you are
this time his claims to his father about killing people are very hypocritical considering he killed that woman helped to kill dome and did nothing to help nan
the poor man felt so bad about disappointing tyme that he dreamt about fixing his mistakes and being a good person but too late
probably a lot of people will be swearing at tonkla but he did what he had to do title and great got rid of his brother like trash so they deserved the same fate
its just the 6th episode so i wonder how things will continue now will the series take into account the timeline great created in his mind or it will be just forgotten


the poor man felt so bad about disappointing tyme that he dreamt about fixing his mistakes and being a good person but too late probably a lot of people will be swearing at tonkla but he did what he had to do title and great got rid of his brother like trash so they deserved the same fate
full agree 
i am team tonkla kill em all kla i support you 
but also bratty great was hot af  and in another parallel universe i really really really really want the tyme that grabbed great by the hand and dragged him away from the aunties that were making the food when great got pickybratty and disciplining him


this show has an interesting concept but unfortunately the romance between great and tyme is the weakest part imo this is an issue that i have with sammon shows overall she doesnt write compelling romances the thrillermystery and some characters are the strongest aspect of her stories 


correct sammons work never makes the romance the plot it isnt central its just kinda thrown in there with some hotness but desire and want and passion stemming from actual romance is never central or important in her stories so we knew going in that it is unlikely that we would get happy romantic vibes

just because romance isnt the plot doesnt mean you cant still incorporate a compelling romance its interesting that boc did kinnporsche which did have a more compelling central romance but the mafia concept was underwritten imo they are doing interesting productions but need to find a balance 



secret crush on you
here is my contribution im ashamed that i havent read through the epicly long thread but here is my super long contribution
ok think i have two different theories about what is going on im not sure which im leaning toward more and i know i missing something but here we go anything is italic is my guesses
three timeline theory
for this one there are three different timelines og great and thyme great and thyme both get a chance to fix their past and then their combined efforts will be able to give everyone a hea
original timeline
this is the timeline that kla korn and wins story is taking place in it is the opening for each episode including the first one
title kills dome and great helps reluctantly greats help is caught on the dashboard cam of titles car
win gets pulled into kla and the injustice of his brothers death is being kicked under the carpet he agrees to move in with kla for protection while kla kicks korn to the curb for being a shitty boyfriend
kla drugs title puts him in titles car just like dome and kills him he also watches the cars dash cam and finds out about great
win finds out about kla and tips him off he is about to be arrested  win might have found out before moving in but i dont think he could have hidden the evidence for that long
kla flees and goes and shoots great
kla or win kills korn more on this down below
we get to see the rundown of this in episode 6 but here are a few things that will be important later on in both theories
in this timeline thyme and great arent that close thyme is using great and although there are moments with tyme where there is something more he hesitates to upload the video it takes looking at his moms picture to push him into do that he also didnt try to use great again but pushed him firmly away there is something there perhaps in another life type of thing but no way can anything happen in this time line despite this they part on very bad terms i do believe thyme was also transferring a great deal of his own guilt at nans death to great and greats words were said because he was mad at thymes accusations that he knew were true neither one of them wanted to face the part they played in her death
in this timeline nan dies she has already passed a flashdrive to thyme but she was captured trying to steal info about the investors in the casino they were on her phone uploaded somewhere but thyme doesnt have them if he had access to her cloud there would be no reason to sneak out to give him flashdrives he only has what she has already given him so it wont be a complete list of all the people involved in the casino there will be some still able to help greats dad cover things up like the general that is holding the cops off so they can clear the warehouse
we dont get to see what happens to thyme after they part but all the opening episodes have been in the og timeline so the first one where thyme is shot would be included
the rest is my guesses on what happens after they part thyme goes back to the warehouse maybe it is to retrieve nans body maybe korn wanting to get rid of thyme for screwing with his brother and trying to expose his family tricks thyme into a meeting at the warehouse
korn stabs thyme hoping to kill him but is interrupted by kla kla is ready to kill korn great killed his brother korn has been a spectacularly shitty boyfriend and murder seems to be rather fun right now thyme escapes wounded
it also could be klas part doesnt go down in the warehouse but korn finds out about klas murder spree and confronts him win shots korn to protect kla either way i suspect win will be a party to this killing if that happens it could be a random goon stabbing thyme
this is were we meet up with episode 1 the guy that shoots thyme isnt going to be one of korns men he is a hitman that is hired at the temple to kill great in greats timeline in the og timeline i suspect he has been hired by nans pregnant friend to kill tyme for getting nan involved in his revenge and getting her killed

earthmix 
and now that im a little bit less confused does this mean that it doesnt really matter the timeline great is going to end up shot and probably dead
but it seems like all the tonkornwin stuff is realtime happenings 
omgggg

tyme said scar be prepared i am choking 


i love how much of a brat great is the look of disbelief he had when tyme said we cannot see each other again he was genuinely confused to be rejected the way he was looking all over like thinking can u believe this guy he said no to me and my bubbly asscomment image immediately he called his brother the one person he knew will never reject him he and ming in msi are typical rich brats they might not outright go to hurt a person but they wont help anyone also like how great tried to stop title from killing dome but did not give much care about it altogether they are made more trouble due to their ever supporting elder brothers the kind of brothers who will only ask are u hurt if the younger call them to say they killed someone then they meet someone who will say no to them for the first time in their whole life now they are done and cant leave the other person ever how great wants to change for tyme and wished their first meeting to be romanticcomment image im sure if ming had his 4 minutes he wud wish for the same with joe all in all loving all our cute brats


omg is great actually an ahole like evil evil somehow i liveeee


i guess its true birds of a feather and all that
i found it odd he was friends with a red flag like title that should have been a clue seems like the whole family might be rotten  to the core that has not been established yet
seeing korn wiping his bloody hands today made it clear he is more hands on and doesnt leave everything to his henchmen like i originally thought 

i knew it his instinct is not great and only his revised memories are good ugh


finally bible  thank you episode 6 for your service

whyyyyyyyy did they cut the nc like that it should have progressed without interruption  it would have been epic 


because they are tired of being accused of making corn 
i agree with you i wanted more 


actually why in the world is great so into tyme they hooked up one time where tyme secretly filmed a sex tape to fuck up greats family and great was just lets do that again but this episode got me seriously stressed honestly they need to make these like kdramas and have 70 minute episodes because 45 to 50 minutes are definitely not enough also im seriously missing wintonkla we havent seen them interact properly in like 2 episodes

yeah it actually made me so sad for great that he seemingly has such little selfrespect or selfcare that he just doesnt care and even goes after tyme again he is so messed up



wow  greattyme im shocked fourhublmao for 4 mins  lol nd only fans lmao
but this show is genius timetravel4 mins future thingy is done right they gave us a whole ep about whatll happen without 4 min abilityit was interesting 
and i predicted it was tonkla from his shaky handsmaybe he knew about great being an accomplice nd how he helped title with body disposal of dome so he took revenge and killed both title and greatmaybe he got the car dashcam footage and now hes wanted by the police
i love this show its genius i really liked jesbible in this ep it was natural great was not too kind he was coward and tyme lmao posting video on 4hub and also great is freaky like who in the right mind will follow tyme after thathe really is shameless haan wow i thought he set that secret camera to find out greats dirt hit nd run nd title case but he just did that all for nothing i also thought great will get revenge but bro got so hooked after their hookup and became cute puppy after that and the durex ad nd packet lube lmao also sleepy cat tortured to eat that sponsored cat food poor babie
i love this show i still dont know whats real nd fake at this point but i have no clue how the next eps will be this bl has my fav genre and im enjoying all this suspensethrillermystery 
i also liked tymegreat scenesnoodlescared of dogshandholding felt domesticnatural and fluffy i liked this scenes in this ep more than the arcadeboba tea one 
they both look so good here 

heres what would have made greattyme be a real romance with heat which is what i wanted but sammon and pond dont want us to have
tyme knocks into great in the hospital before knowing his name and is absolutely stunned by how hot he is the most realistic thing that could have occurred its absurd it doesnt have you seen bible in that shirt
tyme later goes to the bar because his research shows that the rich gay son goes there he sees great again and cant help but talk to him immediately attracted they banter and only then does tyme find out that great is actually the son hes been researching hes shocked
great makes a move and they wind up at greats we see tyme torn because this was supposed to be about revenge but its become something else because hes super into great
hes torn but decides to discreetly set up his phone before things get serious
they have sex and its clear its about mutual magnetic attraction and theres more emotion to it than either of them expect because theyre both wounded lonely souls looking for connection but so afraid of it
at no point does anyone have to go to the bathroom
tyme is torn afterwards but decides to go through with blackmail
great finds him and they have that date as shown and its clear theyre both into each other but tyme is torn
tyme tells great they cant see each other but hes obviously upset
the rest can basically happen as we saw
but thats not what happened
because there is no romance or fated love story subplot
its just about wounded morally gray characters who are going to die
because they dont want us to be happy
i added him he hasnt written back to me yet 
he dead 


the peachesare back againhoorayso we have involuntary manslaughteraccessory to murderthis is the real greathe may have hated what his family does but he is just the same and he cant escape thisthere was also no romantic dr tymehe was on his revenge mission did his research and targeted greatso was tonklahe saw that dashcam video and went after greatat least greats mother is alivebut how much of these are visions of wishful thinking
edit is inspector stache win harbouring tonklaseems like mr tonkla anuwat has flown the coop and is possibly in hidingthe description for this ep says this is the reality realmgreats dad mentions three realms1 greats realm2reality realmwhose is the 3rd pov realm

cherry magic 
i dont have words this ep was just a gigantic slap in the face i finished the ep drained of any constructed opinion and feeling just a big waaaaaaoooooooooohhhhhhhh  its so freaking good omg  it will definitly go down in history of bl and well talk about it for a long time

im already 5 mins in and i knew they were going to do this and im glad cause i really wanted to know what happened in the other timeline



oh im a little gagged i think this might be my favorite episode overall so far will have to rewatch all episodes to be sure but the plot twist the flow and finally that scene
everyone is morally gray and i love that great being the spoiled little rich bitch that he is but with a little bit of a conscience just a little bit lol tyme baby that was nasty work but he was kind of sweet afterwards  and then theres sweet doe eyed baby boy turned serial shooter tonkla and im not mad at it
though i will admit im a little salty were not getting the spice level we deserve with these tymegreat nc scenes like the first one i can understand but i was expecting like level 11 today and i got maybe a 7 i mean i still enjoyed it i just needed more 


though i will admit im a little salty were not getting the spice level we deserve with these tymegreat nc scenes like the first one i can understand but i was expecting like level 11 today and i got maybe a 7
i am so here  i think the expectations were set and not met and unmet expectations are the worst to overcome i wish i had no expectations cause then i wouldnt be disappointed and would have probably enjoyed it much more 
when i first saw the snippets of their them doing that shown in the previous episodes through greats time memory i thought itll be a beautiful moment of them with such passionate intent they have for one another with the way they painted itbut nahh it ended up way messy of an outcome than what ive expected like tyme out here exposing great theyre both acting like strangers and their onenight stand situation this episode is truly mindblowing and it conveys a different perspective with how it would have gone if great didnt alter his actions again i am loving this sm i love time traveling and their decisionbased format its so fascinating to see each varying aftermaths 

enlighten me guys what is happening

this episode is all about what really happened in real time while the previous episodes were mostly scenes of great imagining the things he could do right before dying basically he is shot in both the reality and imagination 


there is a slew of gifs to peruse come on in

tonklaaa what are you doing here babes 



honestly
wow


holy shiiii the ass bite thats it im dead and buried 
okay but i kinda like this dynamic better than previous episodes i might be broken
still not really sure whats happening though lol ill read everyones comments and get clued up on the theories



i dont interact much here but i follow the show i wanted to ask if someone else noticed this or could explain in ep 3 tyme visits great in his university he gives him a drink with a note asking him to check his head injury but it changes for a second to tyme asking great to forgive him but this scene did not appear in the original timeline they showed today will it be explained in upcoming episodes

i think that was probably greats mind wishing that tyme would regret what he did or possibly tymes flashbacks bleeding in as maybe he will regret the revenge porn

this also bugged me and ive read multiple theories but none really feel like they fit im hoping something in an upcoming ep makes it make sense otherwise the wishful thinking theory is the predominant one but i think if thats the case its unnecessarily confusing





so your basically saying that tyme does survive his wound and head injury the one where he almost had brain damage so tyme gives him a drink at his school that says forgive me
i can do it with a broken heart
hm i woke up and i had this this thought could the two different storylines we saw be either testimonies great and tyme give to the police or both storylines were the idealised versions greats and tymes brains are conjuring up and we are yet to see what really happened  we already know what we are being shown isnt a linear timeline and we also know theres different povs and both arewere probably dead or dying at some point in the story
ugh im slightly confused and im loving it 


late to the party because i have a big girl job help i work 7 days a week i am so tired when jungkook said 7 days a week i did not think he meant this
this show is wild
so greats actually a terrible person and everything weve seen so far is him trying to recreate his memories whilst he dies careful great your vegas is showing
i ordered them to delete all the cctv footage chills honestly kinda sad great is a piece of shit i liked soft bible you hit and killed someone with your car exactly have some remorse vegasi mean great tbh if i hit and killed someone with my car send me to jail like damn their whole family is immoral great thank your dad for covering up the murder you just did greats 4 minute brain deprived of oxygen making his victim suicidal to cope with the fact that he killed her is insane great and korn probably have a shit relationship too which is why he imagined it was better and that korn a bad guy
i keep forgetting about title but what a fucking psychopath get some new friends great you cant just likekill people poor dome dome was stressed jumped in the water and killed himself oh yeah and he also smashed his own face in with a rock title you dumbass i kinda feel like great maybe has some morality but hes a product of terrible circumstances and has bad people around him and a shit father and complacent mother bible  having characters with shit fathers lol hope his irl dad is nice 
the cat  chonky bby
so tike is normal now because this is the real world and what actually happened on a side note speaking of time and clocks i went to check my laundry earlier and the washing machine had 4 minutes left
great and his low cut v your vegas is showing
does thyme know whats going on with the whole reality 4 minutes thing i wouldnt be surprised sammon has pulled this move before triage when tol started living the time loop after tin died

sup dad fucking lol 
always the parents pissed off their sons are gay
nah i miss soft kinda shy great take me back to their kiss in the car after they won the plushies
thymes parents started the gambling business hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
ah so korns still a piece of shit
i love all the subtle differences between the scenesx
rip nan
yeah we knew tonkla wasnt a good person when he whipped out his meth pipe and cheated on his boyfriend with the cop assigned to investigate his brothers murder
2 mire eps left 8 episodes simply is not long enough


okay i know everyone is aboard the great is evil train but i have to say even in this versiontimeline whatever i think he is a weak man and grey but not evil like hes not evil for killing the lady with his car she straight up is trying to get killed and jumps into the road in a tunnel pedestrians shouldnt be in is he weak or cowardly for fleeing the scene for sure but theres no malice involved here and then when he doesnt rescue nan in time same deal he hesitated due to fear and she got shot the biggest sin for me is when he helps dispose of the body you can be shocked at witnessing murder but you need to then say yeah screw you im out of here at the minimum i just feel its important to distinguish the world where he wants to be the hero that his inner desires are to go against the values hes been raised with his entire life so its not evil great timeline for me is realistic great timeline and in both of them hes a sad puppy that desperately wants any crumbs of affection that time will give him


i dont think we think great is evil just a coward

gotta love a fierce kvnt baddie


bocs cinematography
i wish i was rich enough to own a marble table with a built in lazy susan specifically for trying to buy off my enemies


i can do it with a broken heart
i cant wait for later tonight to watch this from the looks of it tyme great is getting whats coming for him and great tyme is showing him whos bitch boss am i right
there i fixed it


will tonkla and win be the ones hiding out in the original timeline




just fyi  the global streaming link in the main post is linked to the wrong subreddit post there needs to be an s inbetween boy and love in the url the link goes to a banned subreddit


omg lol thank you fixed you are the best


does anyone have an opinion on gaga vs iqiyi i dont have time to analyze the subtitles from both but was wondering if someone else has looked at them


looked at a couple of scenes and it was exactly the same



ok i am taking a breath and just giving my hot takes before i got back now and rewatch
i was too anxious waiting for the nc to come so i didnt pay attention to anything truly until it happened then i was lost there for a while until i got angry and now i hate all bathrooms everywhere forever and also yay tyme could keep it hard while being inspector gadget and casually slip a condom on after 10 min of walking around fourhub vs pornhub is my favorite let us know how many of you searched for secretmp4 already 
post my anger about the nc being abruptly interrupted when it could have been the greatest nc of all time i didnt pay attention to much that happened after that
the end yes kla i am on your team you gave us epic ncs with so much context that i am jumping over to your team and you can go head and kill them all tbh
baddie great although a coward is way hotter than ep15 great by an exponentially huge percentage since ep1 we saw that greats initial instincts are not those of a great human only his revised memory in hindsight seems to understand what the right thing to do is
i knew it we are getting different pov all out of order and greats and tymes memories  added in hindsight i would have done x differently while both are on the verge of death sammon is a doctor and wont go fully into timelines and scifi she just likes to explore human decisions and medical mysteries
once i rewatch without rage and anticipation and can properly pay attention i will come back

sammon is a doctor and wont go fully into timelines and scifi
everybody says that but triage is also from her and wasnt it full of supernatural time travel and all genuine question since i havent watched it yet only bits and pieces
tonklaaa what are you doing here babes 

the way i kept thinking if the camera man just slipped a little and nobody noticed

can someone help me why didnt greats mom get shot again i dont understand if episode 6 is showing the reality of how things actually happened does that mean nice great wanted her to die in the previous episode or what im confused


nice great wanted her to die in the previous episode or what im confused
probably he realizes she is not a good person maybe


anyone in sea using iqiyi to watch 4minute what vpn you used





is the so sultry version on gaga or iqiyi bc i just saw a clip from an nc scene in epi 4 that i had not seen and i have been watching the sultry version on iqiyi does viu have its own version of the show it was a really short clip so i dont know exactly whats going on but it looks like tonk la went to wins apartment
guys i need an explanation for ep 6 cus im so lost i beeeg


the prevailing theory is that ep 6 is the original timeline  what actually happened everything weve seen that conflicts  changes what weve seen in ep 6 is great revising events due to wishful thinking  regret during the 4 minutes hes still alibe after his heart stops beating when he got shot
episode 6 tells us what really happened not the alternate reality great is creating after his heart attack


now i can die in peace


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
without spoilers what is the spice level for this episode on a scale from 1 to 10


very flat and boring for me i didnt love it its greartyme  it was interrupted and lacked intensity for me
others may disagree

ok so this was another parallel universe where great didnt save the woman and his relationship with tyme was mostly tymes revenge and also fuckin title killin dome i guess this is the connection to the beggining and the ending of this episode tonkla killed great thats why the police was searching tonklas house at the beggining maybe title sent part of that footage to him
they summarized 5 episodes into one to show another version lol i also felt like i was watching the battle of the bastards from game of thrones because i couldnt see a damn thing
anywho i was like this the entire episode
edit wait im seeing on twitter that some are saying thi is the og timeline and great is in a coma cause tonkla shot him pls i need answerssss


the theory is that episodes 15 greats scenes were just in his mind and it was a wishful thinking of what he would have done if he could travel to the past and fix his mistakes not killing the lady in the hit and run saving dome and nan and of course helping tyme and having a loving relationship with him
this episode 6 shows what happened in the real world and greats real personality a rich brat who didnt care about anything and was able to commit murder and of course his relationship with tyme was just sex and not love great probably regretted everything when tyme called him a coward and while he is dying he imagines the other timeline episodes 15
ok i have a question havent watched this episode yet is it explicit like yk any nc scenes


its explicit yes but not as explicit as the prior ncs


yep

not reading comments bc my internet is out again 




so what happened to greats mom that is the only death we have not revisited in original timeline

she never got shot because the lady died before being able to hire a hitman this is the crumb im holding onto to justify the multiple timelines plotline since there is a solid divergence and consequence of great fixing his mistakes which wouldnt happen if he was just imagining a world where he manages to save everyone while his brain is shutting down form the 4 minutes of no oxygen he has no way of knowing that the lady has a grudge against his family so the other timeline cant just be all in his head right 


yesss the sultry returns there been so many hot scenes but seeing jesbibles entire sexy bodies is a whole another level
so my predictions are right so far it is another timeline and the 4 minutes are visions from the previous times
but hes died twice now and there might be another twist lurking
i cant believe were almost done this series goes by way too fast 


sex scenes aside can someone please discuss the plot who do yall think shot great i think its tonkla or maybe tyme


its tonkla 


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
bible was having a great tyme i cant believe it was all being taped i feel so betrayed


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
shocked at who we saw in the last scene



i have to say i am surprised and really delighted that this show is so gorgeous not just the nc scenes but the whole thing is practically cinematic the lighting photography score all of it is a joy to watch   
i spent a couple of episodes wondering what the hell was going on with tonklas storyline since it didnt make sense with what we were seeing strongly implied he killed title who we later saw alive etc but what we were seeing was greats neardeath revisionist history and since he didnt know anything about tonkla it makes sense now that we never got a revised version of what was happening there i think but we still have 2 episodes left and a few questions still left from the earlier eps will there ever be an explanation for the note on the cup of iced tea what would tyme have to ask greats forgiveness for so i cant imagine greats death is going to take immediately  unless he spends them in the pink room of brain death with the other 4 minutes patient which seems like a bit of a waste  
nothing better happen to that cat is all

when i said i needed more tonal i didnt mean it that way lmao





i must say i really miss tonkla and win last episodes i hope they will have much more time in last 2 episodes i need more awesomely psycho tonkla  and i hope win is not saint either yeah so great heard tymes voice and basically imagined another version of everything working out differently 

i hate it if its true 


he can die with no regrets a bold ending if thats the case  honestly i dont hate it

lmao if they die and thats the end 


yup
seriously sammon decided to kill us with baby tyme and baby great just in case the rest didnt kill you already 

nooooooo baby great feeding baby tyme why are you doing this to meeee


this was so sweet
it also explains a bit why tyme looked somewhat reluctant when they hooked up i thought it was because he had intended to release that video but its because he was going to do that to someone he was actually fond of

id like to believe that yes he was def struggling and looked very torn 

isnt baby great baby grumpy great grampa mini version in century of love

thats what i came here to ask i think it is baby great is baby san 

yes that guy is a very good kid actor like nina from love sea and the loyal pin


yes thats the girl from the sign special episode as well right the niece in love sea they are both great amazing


sammon is on my shitlist


im sitting at that temple where you can hire some people to help you out with your revenge problems as we speak 
the moment i have heard this is my son tyme i went no way

you kill mine i kill you
bad bitches only


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
the way i kept thinking about new when tonkla was going through w his revenge plot i live for both these crazy vengeful boys


that kid who was doing little great is the same who did little san daous character in century of love that boy is going places 3


he is sooo good


he is 


haha i had a omg where do i know this kid from moment before it clicked


same 


my entire game plan with 4 minutes rests on reading the posts on here about 4 minutes because i dont understand whats going on with the plot but keep on watching anyway because bible is in it


for the first 5 episodes every time you see great on screen only him this is important you are actually following his memories of events since he had a cardiac arrest after being shot the 4 minutes thing allows him to create an alternative reality and change the events that happened in real life i guess its his way of coping you have conformation of this with episode 6 which shows us the true events  reality
basically each event that happened before great goes back 4 minutes in those episodes is actually what happened as you can see in ep 6 so he left the lady in the middle of the tunnel he let his friend kill dome he left the girl die etc
now why does great get shot starting all this because domes brother tries to kill him and he gets a cardiac arrest and starts to see 4 minutes in the future just like the lady explains to the other doctor that is doing research on near death experiences
remember i mentioned that only when we see great we are following memories well what we see for the other characters during all episodes is actually the reality this is way one minute we see great saving dome and another his brother morning himon greats memoriesalternative reality he saved dome but in reality he was killed
hope that helps let me know if you have any questions


what a fantastic explanation of the show so far 


bibles hair and lack of buttons and fits overall keep me glued to this series eventhough i hate that there is zero romance

only one episode left tt
im really intrigue of what were going to get for the last episode 
as always ive made a diagram linking everything if someone has other info dont hesitate


i loveeee your spreadsheets

awwwwweeee baby great and baby tyme are so cute im dying actually 


last ep so youre still afraid of dogs 


i thought that was weird last epmakes sense now 
oh look its ton  kla 


so its as we expected 
the beginning of the eps have been showing us a scene from original og timeline reality
eps 15 showed us greats alternate timeline of events after he flatlines where we learn hes just a sappy romantic who dreams of awkward dates and awkwarder sex and pretends to be a virgin
eps 67 we see og timeline  reality in detail
end of 7 we see the beginning of tymes alternate timeline at the moment he decides whether to read his moms diary
killers
klas father killed the cat as uthoughtsallday predicted
kla kills his father
warit  korns fiances dad kfd killed tymes parents
great kills suicidal woman
title kills dome with great as an accomplice
gambling manager kills mon nans friend
gambling manager kills nan
kla kills title
kla shoots great
warit kfd kills tymes grandma
warit kfd shoots tyme or orders it
sammon killed my dreams any remaining hope for a romance and any chance for a hot greattyme nc scene
mysteries solved
the alternate tea im sorry great comes from something tyme says to great while great is in a coma state notably before he starts flatlining so not during his 4 minutes
tyme and great met as kids so tyme knew great used to be afraid of dogs
unsolved mysteries
who is lakwa and what does she have to do with great
why does greats alternate timeline contain things he could not know like things that happen when hes not there and is it just lazy writing
why am i still hoping for a satisfying ending
aww i knew tonkla didnt do it 


told ya the dad killed the cat 

so im guessing this is he beginning of tymes neardeath hindsight is 20220 journey and hes probably still gonna read the diary lol 


but this time he read it with new eyes this time he saw that his parents apologized cause they were actuallu the ones that caused this entire huge mess he has also already read doc dens research so he will figure out he is within the 4 min cycle way faster than great did



jes and fuaiz delivering the acting this ep 
were down to the wire and i still dont have an inkling how its gonna end and what the heck is even happening sammon really outdid herself with this show
and of course they knew each other as kids

everything is great but half this episode being stuff that we already saw definitely annoyed me


right there with u

whoever come up with the idea of 8 episode count your days

this show is so amazing its beautifully acted produced edited and curated its the first show i couldnt wait for the next episode since only friends and i ended up not finishing that one live it has everything my heart is in it i care so much about the characters it may not be perfect for some just leaving leeway for others opinions not that ive seen much differing ones but its been such a perfect ride for me i cant wait for the last episode regardless how i think they stick the landing next week this has been such a fun and loving ride to watch week after week


i love it so much when a series grabs us and makes us feel so much 
i support tonklas rights and wrongs


me to kla

oh
my
gawd


hope tyme will brutally kill that disgusting trash of a human uncle during his 4minutes scenario

well this was the worlds weirdest tomatoe cutting 
anyways if i didnt love tonkla before i did id love him now still do  what a pos father
why do we not see korn in the hospital with great did he run
the scene with tymes grandma tho omfg did not see that coming


the blood running down the sink i was like how much juice do these tomatoes have

i want to know how he managed to cut all those tomatoes with the cutting board on that weird ass angle and not get any on his shirt
the grandma thing did suck that was not cool

smh useless flop this is why baby t gotta do it himself


 no one does anything right except for kla his villain origin story is justified and all his choices too kla is the star of this series he is the lead and i am 100 behind him 

hes never done anything wrong ever in his life


ever




voluntarily heisted by yinwar happily murdered by firstkhao
his villain origin story is justified and all his choices too kla is the star of this series he is the lead
agreed i kept thinking they gave him such an interesting story and arc and he should have been on the poster honestly

useless flop  useful top 

im sorry but the instagram  being thegreat is iconic 

lmao loved it also highly predictable of him 

bocs cinematography
i neeeed to know whats going to happen with korn and tongkla now that kla knows that korns brother is one of the ones that killed dome

earthmix 


i just want tonkla to take his revenge i wish he would just kill title that bastard is psycho omg


he killed him 2 weeks ago your wish has been granted 


yes he did i had forgotten haha
he did kill title wait am i tripping

i saw it till the 3rd ep then i decided i would wait for it to be completed and binge i got curious and saw some comments here and the direction it is going
now i am scared to watch it

youre not alone meee tooo
atp just give fuaiz an award or smth
wait so tyme will have his own episodes of 4 minutes to change everything
omgg the child actor that played baby great is the same one that played baby san in century of love he is currently my fav child actor after watching col 


that little kid is awesome
aha clock greats tea  i thought someone was video recording them but then i also thought it was a stylistic choice thing


it was the car camara this boy found the sd card that title threw away title didnt break it the boy found it and the police didnt think the boy made a copy of it


4 minutes come for the nc stay for the story actually and the editing
i know hes not all there but i am team ton kla

wow today is gonna busy i got kidnap 4 minutes three episodes of sunspot only onemaybe i just need to get food poisoning and have to head home
please tell me we get jj x fuaiz in this episode

whatintheactualfuck
i thought i had a pretty good grasp on it i think maybe i do not so rewatch weekend it is
i am mad as hell this is over next week

wow so the final ep will cover tymes 4 minutes and well finally know if they were able to actually change anything i feel like there were a few hints in this ep that it is indeed possible so they might have although theyre both dead in this tl i still hope both are alive in another one they were able to create together 
edit im so fucking not ready for it to be over 


at the very least great fed tyme when they were little and they were adorable together for like 30 min in their childhood one time so i guess saying sammon doesnt do romance is going too far 




i feel so stupid watching this because i have no clue then i come here to get it explained to me so thank you for posting explanations folks  although how itll wrap up with one episode left i have no idea
i bloody love ton kla though everything he does just hits right fuaiz is smashing it
for such an intense show that little heart biscuit bit and the childhood scene was cute


wow this show really is incredibly well done im loving it all the thrill nd darkness
fuaiz and jj both are good actors no doubt wow i like them especially tonkla that psychotic man wow killed his abusive dad for his beloved black cat great was shot by him in the elevator and i guess title was stoned to death exactly where his brother dome was killed that explains why the officers arrived at his house
so all this 4 min thingy is just their moments of life 4 mins delulu before clinging to life just mins before death i guess
but theres a plot hole i dont understand tho previous ep how did great know that the lady he saved accident in highway was responsible for his moms death and who even is she  unknown she had a son too i hope they explain it in the last ep
jes 4 mins starts from the very beginning where he discovered his moms diary the first regretmistake that led him to leak the evidence nd the messed up situation
tonkla is twisted murderer mostly for revenge so he is like harmless a bit with psychotic hallucinations
greats parents are bad but not too bad i guessto be mega villains
also rip grandmaagain i dont know if this is also real 
rip greattymei guess they showed us what led to the first scene but im still clueless about whats happening maybe last ep will give the answers i really hope they get saved tho
i actually hope this 4 mins is actual magic power of greattymeto alter their lives like second chance to correct all the wrongs and theyll magically just rewind to the beginning to avoid their demise 
since its boc i just know theyll give this show an open ending with two alternative theories and call it a day like kpdffi think ill be puzzled by the ending and end up being even more confused lol
and poor korn too forced to clean up his familys mess on run finds his bro was shottonkla 
villain reveal too
i still have some questions and im excited for the last ep
i also liked the fluffy flashback scenes the kids were too cute nd job with his patient lover cute
overall i think ill give this show 9510 i loooovvvveeee it sammons writing is perfect cinematographydirectionacting wow chefs kiss kudos to the entire 4 min cast nd crew  from coloristthat sets the tone to intimacy coordinatordirectorwritereditor they did a great job i like how the scenes are compiled  and also the storytelling leaves viewers puzzled yet clarifies little by little im in awe wow

this episode made me heartbroken for all the characters and the cat  for tonkla great tymeeven korn like what could have been if the situations were differentthe kids who played young greattyme did so well i could totally picturize them as kid version of gt


they were perfectly cast as little great and tyme


baby tyme and great were so cute  how does baby greats actor look like both bible and daou omg he did so well in both series
someone made a parallel video on tiktok and when i tell you i am stuck in this moment  adult tymegreatbaby tymegreat parallel like this is it this is the show for me
not greats parents dipping first  like they were concerned for him but not that concerned lol
anyways not much from me this episode im not expecting a happy ending but i am afraid its not going to stick the landing for me  i will say it again 8 episodes feels too short

baby tyme smiling here 


gosh in this gif these boys look so much like bible and jes   perfection


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
i noticed that in most thai bls they really seem to make an effort to find child actors who you can believe grow up to look like their adult counterparts


i rolled my eyes hard when they revealed the childhood connection sammon took the lazy way out again i guess because the relationship between greattyme is still so underdeveloped so they are trying to force some connection and emotion but it doesnt work for me the most interesting thing about greattyme is   the 4 minutes concept   
 i suspect tonkla didnt kill his cat all along his actions are justified hes been totally wronged by the justice system and had to take matters into his own hands 

ton kla is verrry dexter coded especially with the cutting tomatoes and juiceblood in the sink

i am finally all caught up and ready to join theory shenanigans
forgive me for not reading through all the last 6 episodes onairs waaaaay too many comments but believe me when i say i lived through the gifs thanks to uimomen  feeding us all 
 thoughts so far
i live for this timeywimeywibblywobbly sht thoroughly entertaining the cinematography the directing has all been on point
fuaiz is a revelation and doing all the heavy lifting when it comes to the nc except for that time win was heavy lifting tonkla
the chemistry between tyme and great in comparison which is totally unfair cause fuaiz is killing it has been a little flat for me
i know tonkla is a murderer and probably unredeemable at this point but i was so much more invested in his slow decent to madness i thought that characterisation was so well played out moreso than great fixing his regrets because we didnt really know him at that point the real great is now so much more interesting and his actions make more sense now
 theory notes  predictions
there are 2 main timelines so far shoutout to longjumpingad6775 who did a great summarytheory with events from the multiple timelines
og where tonklas brother dome is killed he hooks up with inspector win and he goes on a revenge mission murdering tle and shooting great
4 minutes where great is able to reverse domes death but also women in the tunnel  who goes on a revenge mission and hires someone who eventually shoots great i know there are offshoots from this timeline too every time he changes the future but lets keep it simple because my old brain cant process it all
weve seen flashes of a timeline where the apology thai tea had a different message so theres at least one scene that possibly belongs to a third timeline possibly this third timeline is the final one where somehow they make it all right and everyone has a happy ending right
how does the female patient who also claims to be able to see 4 minutes into the future fit into the story i think maybe we will see more of her this episode or she could just be in greats head
even though there isnt a reason for them to meet in the alternate 4 minutes timeline i hope we see tonkla and win crossing paths anyway because fate

episode 7 thoughts
yes tonklas villain arc has come full circle and  to echo thoughts comment  he should have been the lead character though i admit it makes it more surprising that we didnt know the seemingly innocent side character was the villain of the story until later
so we do see the female patient again and tyme looks through doctor friends research hes going to learn a way to trigger the 4 minutes phenomenon possibly in himself
little great is so freaking cute the feeding of snacks to little tyme the hiding from a tiny dog adorbs i believe hes the same child actor from century of love and he was great in that too
so tyme knew who great was all along more than the fact he was his enemies son but that he knew great was afraid of dogs because they met as kids
i had a theory that the repeating 1100 motif was time of death  and this episode showed it 1104 would be the time both great and tyme wake up from temporary death im not confident 1 more episode is enough to wrap up everyones stories let alone give us a happy ending i have no idea how theyll give us a satisfying ending will people get their justice will anyone have a happy ending or will we get an openended ending and tyme and great are forever stuck in this loop where they are undoing their regrets over and over again

possibly this third timeline is the final one where somehow they make it all right and everyone has a happy ending right
im with you on the delulu train lets gooooo


win was heavy lifting tonkla 


so from what im seeing here everyone sucks nothing that happens matters and everyones gonna die unless episode 8 turns it all on its head i might be opting out

ive been holding out on watching since ch4 because im awful with cliffhangers so i need a good soul to tell me if i should catch up today or wait another week
im a bit disappointed that we got so little of tymegreat this episode especially because i started watching this show because of bible however i could even accept them dying in the end if that is necessary for a good storytelling sorry for my grammar english isnt my first language



omg that kid that found the clip might be the son of the suicide lady
i am living for villain kla so justified go kla
so he didnt kill the cat the cat was his villain origin story and like i said in ep1 the black cat  is his hallucination and the cigarettes are his alter personality 
fuaiz deserves all the praise this series when ton kla discovered that great was korns brother and then did that smirk brilliant he realised great and title were in powerful positions and going to get away with it all
im curious if great and tyme are in seperate realities or can they meet each other just like lukwa saw great in the 4 minutes room
all i hope for in the end is that ton kla living somewhere safe with lots of cats


when ton kla discovered that great was korns brother and then did that smirk brilliant
it was a great smirk however i find it odd that in 8 years he never realized who great is i mean i am sure kla stalks korns insta and that photo was on his insta and tagged  so in 8 years he never figured out who korns brother was

that was basically exactly what i thought it all was i honestly feel like this has been clear once the 4 minutes thing was explained so now we just wait to see if it goes more supernatural and tyme and great are able to live in another timeline the only thing ive been unclear about is the lady who met great and also saw 4 minutes she said today she felt shed be stuck in her 4minutes world forever if her exboyfriends voice hadnt brought her backmaybe alluding to this other timeline where tyme and great will get stuck but in a happier world but then what was that scene where she met great with that weird voice about the brain and 4 minutes them actually meeting each other implies another world or timeline to me going with that theory over just purgatory or death
and i still have to say i do not see the jjfuaiz thing at all basfuaizsmoking jjs character was a total doofus in this so maybe thats whyand he was an ahole in dff and i cant get past the pornstache

in my villain era
fuck sammonvisually love this series the cinematography is to die for everything is so intentionally done with meaning right down to the framing i love aystemetical framing and the dutch tilts in the series are so well done
but
fuck sammon and her bullshit unoriginal writing she had a chance here to do something original something different but nowe need recycled plots form triage and mod i knew i shouldnt have got so invested in the plotline but i was naive i had hope we were going to do something different i mean it didt have to be completely revolutionary but at least something with a twist anything to keep the viewer guessing to the end
finale better be unhinged but this episode aside from the beautiful visuals was a slap in the face

i just read through the post and was wondering will the finale air next week or only on the friday after september 23rd this is an existential question 


so far it is airing next week in addition to it being shown this coming monday in person plus on friday also in person and on viugagaiqiyi
idol factory usually delays the youtube release when they do an in person theatre finale but boc doesnt delay

earthmix 

someone please tell me if korn goes and apologize and makeup with tonkla


highly unlikely after what kla discovered today

yea so much for happy ending theories
so im guessing this is he beginning of tymes neardeath hindsight is 20220 journey and hes probably still gonna read the diary lol 

i can do it with a broken heart
im think well get an open ending where both tyme and great remain in a third timeline aka in a coma but i havent watched ep 7 yet


since we are nearing the end here there will be no more sad very sadso greatyme knew each other when they were youngwhat greats dad said was true dr tymes parents were the og gambling lords but was later corrupted and double crossed by uncle warit and greats dadi thought the black cat haunting and the collar was a memento of kornits a trigger for tonkla in his serial killer modefirst kill the dad pushed him down the stairs2nd kill title as revenge for killing baby bro dome3rd kill or attempted murdergreat for helping dump the bodygreatyme will see each other in their 4minutes i guess that glamping guitar hammock scene as they are both dyingmeanwhile where is tonklawill he get caughtwill win get to win tonklahow can korn forgive tonkla for shooting his beloved brother greatone episode leftwho gets to live and survivetheres a slim hope of a hea because as i remember they killed barcode in dff


remember they killed barcode in dff
exactly


like dff i see this as an open ending


yup



welli wish i was wrong but they will all die right  the trauuuumaaaaaaaa
edit i just thought of something in greats memoriesalt reality he had tyme thristing for himhahahamade me laugh in the middle of the despair i am feeling because i hate unhappy endingsits the reason i am not breaking and watching onl1y onei have a felling that one going to mess me up


he had tyme thristing for him
that scene of him checking himself in the mirror and fixing his sleeves for maximum flexingit takes on a whole new sad meaning now

on1y will likely end unhappily while they bank on getting the script for s2 funded 

is tonklas cat a reincarnation of salem cause


lol

i have so much to say but all im gonna say is what the fuck


wtf seems to be the concensus 

that drop of tears 

 but also this to me looked like a hint that he and great can actually go back and change stuff and not only in his head  staying delulu yay 

fuaiz completely stole the episode for me his acting has absolutely blown me away and his character has been consistent for the last 7 episodes he didnt just turn bad its who hes always been
i am not sure what exactly i am expecting for the ending but i just hope that everything is resolved in a satisfying manner
when lukwa said her lovers voice brought her back from her  4 minutes  and then it cut to great responding to tymes voice 


fuaiz completely stole the episode for me
he stole the entire series for me he was the lead actor 100


is the release time different on different platforms


yes as explained above
but viu and gaga are only a few minutes apart for example



definitely going to wait for the finale to come out before i watch this ep so i can binge them together  god damn from what ive read kla is the main and honestly good for him


kla is the main and honestly good for him
without a shadow of a doubt he is the main he should have been on the poster

im so glad that most of what i predicted came out to be right im finding this more easier to follow along


secret crush on you
well here is my last attempt i think at this point we have two options the first is fairly straightforward the apocalypse scenario where either one or both of them wake up after being shot but experiencing the 4 minute loops if it both more than likely great will wake up first and then go and talk to thyme so he can hear greats voice in his coma and wake up like the woman said happened to her
thyme in his 4 minute loops will put the diary back and never get involved with the casino he will either never start dating the girl or break up with he will meet great and remember the time they had together as kids and fall in love when they both wakeup life around them is unchanged and their lives are basically screwed up but hey at least they now have a bond together after witnessing the 4 minute flashback loops and are in love oo
everybody is either dead or on the run in this option so im not sure what you have left for them expect they are together
kla will go on to kill korn korn disappeared when he went rushing in he found out his brother was shot i wouldnt be surprised if kla lures him in there and takes care of the last detail in his revenge
the next one is where we get a supernatural element going on that when the two of them wake up it is an altered timeline thyme is starting out where he gets the diary it is fairly obvious that the first flashback will lead him to putting the diary back in the end his need for revenge was a wasted effort it leads to the death of the person he really loves his grandma and his mother had a hand in her own death by running a business that brutalized people like nan
that is all thyme has to do to fix his past im not sure about the girlfriend if they were dating before or after the diary from the sounds of it he was using her as a replacement for him for his grandma if something happened to him it is a good possibility she is no longer needed his life if he isnt out for revenge
im fairly sure that we will now be in greats altered timeline they will bump into each other at the hospital but this time thyme will take notice of great as well just as a hot guy we will get a few moments where thyme backs away from great but 4 minute loops so they get close they fall in love since neither one of them is involved in the casino or exposing it neither one will get shot when they both wake up it will mostly likely be in bed together instead of a hospital there is a chance the casino does get exposed by someone else and great does get shot if so he will wake up to have thyme at his side as a boyfriend
since we are on the altered timeline the walking diaster area of klas life wont have happened but i still suspect that things arent going to end well there kla desperate need for raw sex from korn most likely is coming from the fact they started their relationship without condoms and now korn is using them kla has to realize at this point that korn is sleeping with someone else he wasnt korns boy toy at the start korn was helping him get away from his dad and they were in love korn promised he would come out after college and they would be together their college days are long gone and he is still lying in front of kla and now sleeping with others kla has been fooling himself but in episode1 you could see it wasnt working anymore
with the altered timelines korn has no reason to change thing the girl doesnt have leverage to force him into marriage and he is clueless about klas potential for murder but just because dome isnt dead doesnt mean that kla is going to let things stay that way in episode 7 we see the black cat run across the gun when kla realizes that great was helped kill dome and he is korns brother we also seen that black cat in episode 1 korn stops sex to answer a phone call lies and says he is with his girlfriend right in front of kla and then runs out the door to go to dinner with his dad every single thing there is something horrible to do in front of your boyfriend
im fairly sure the black cat is a harbinger of death in klas mind it was impetus for him to kill his dad it was there when he decided to kill great if dome hadnt died im fairly sure that kla would have ended up killing korn for being a terrible boyfriend
as for the casino and everything tied to it i have no clue this last episode showed us it is the fiances dad that actually is the terrible bad guy in all this while the episode itself felt like a retread of stuff that was easy to assume it did gives small details to shade in the story surprisingly greats dad isnt as much of an asshole as we thought moms ruled the day as villains in this story it was greats mom that actually started the business down the black path of illegal crap it was also thymes mom that brought the northern casinos and bootstrapped greats dads business into the casino business greats dad actually didnt want thymes parents killed at all
of course it is the fiances dad that is ultimate bad guy he killed thymes parents and seems to be the driving forced behind the casinos i suspect there will be some kind of way that he ends up dead or in jail by the end of the show but i dont know where it will happen
with there being only 1 more episode what ever they do it isnt going to feel satisfying this last episode was a wasted episode it added minor details but it didnt do a great deal to expand on the 4 minute loop or even add big details to the story going around right now great and thyme feel more like broken strangers 1 more episode isnt going to change that any ending with them together isnt going to leave a believable ending have one or both died would feel like why did we even bother they also have to deal with the casino aspect which once again will feel shallow because the amount of time they can devote to it kla and korn need a tie up as well at this point they only have a single episode to tie up stuff and they havent come close to doing that yet
to be honest the most fascinating story in this show has been klas they needed to get rid of all this supernatural junk and made this a murder love story and this would have been an amazing show


to be honest the most fascinating story in this show has been klas they needed to get rid of all this supernatural junk and made this a murder love story and this would have been an amazing show
kla is the star i dont understand why they have jes bible doing all the press when they are just side characters we know nothing about by ep7 while we know everything about kla and have seen more of his story and more screentime with him than with jesbible
yes make kla kill everyone and then stay with win in a one sided love win loves him kla uses him forever win is the closest we have to love in this alleged boyslove story

i love your theories my guess is anything you wrote even most boring case scenario will be more satisfying than what we see next week
i think one thing still missing for me  and i wonder what you think  is what the heck this lakwa thing is all about the fact that we see her and great in the 4 minutes room is never explained it has to mean something or its just bad writing
as for fuaizkla i didnt watch strong girl namsoon but i followed the hype around it which was all about byeon woo seok who played the villain no one really supported the actual main couple and certainly not the ml played by ong seong woo at the end of the day people watched for bws and he was the main character
thats exactly what 4m reminds me of i dont know if it was intentional but the most compelling actor and character is fuaiz playing kla im left wondering if pond and sammon knew that  especially as they focused so much of the ncs on fuaiz or are they that clueless theres such a disconnect between the marketing of this series and its content
this is not a romance and jesbible dont have scorching chemistry this is a psychological thriller with a complex villain as the lead are the creators not aware of what they made i genuinely want to ask them if theyre aware of this disconnect and why theyre trying to market any of it as sultry imo they look like fools
cc uthoughtsallday
ok now it links to ep1s scene  but now im lost with mhok seeing 11am please dont tell me nothing happen in the end

if jes doesnt survive bible aint surviving either and we may get the last scene with two of them on canoe and time 1104
else someone has to ensure jess reaches hospital too
good thing is  he is shot in abdomen both times and not in chestheart so maybe is meant to survive
jess has read the 4 minutes research so that should help him to regain consciousness from his dream world we already saw that bible regained it with his eyelids shaking when jess was talking to him
the open mystery  why did lookwa see bible in that 4 min room do jess and bible also meet


voluntarily heisted by yinwar happily murdered by firstkhao
thinking about this more the suicide lady is what really kicks off the sequence of events its because of that event that great starts to really shutdown his compassion letting dome and nan die etc for such an important character we dont know a lot about her unless i missed it why did her son die and why did she blame greats family for it was he just some random worker in their gambling operation or is there more to it
if she wasnt so important i think the story could have started with domes death and there wouldnt be much change to the story another vengeful family member maybe related to nan or mon could have hired the hitman to shoot at greathis mum and that still would have made sense
updated predictions  how i think it should end
in the scenario that the entire og and greats alternate timeline is retconned something would have to change before this event so that the suicide lady doesnt try to kill herself with greats car maybe tymes alternate timeline will correct this and he stops his parents from helping set up this gambling operation in the first place and they both live in this hea timeline but in realityog both are dead
or we see tyme attempt to correct the timeline in his 4 minutes alternate reality but isnt able to change much for some reason i keep thinking about the thai milk tea that he gives great how did he know great likes that drink he said he asked around but what random person is going to reveal something so specific and to a total stranger suss perhaps some of the moments weve already seen were from tymes perspective already i think the only thing tyme will be able to change for the better is greats demise but tyme dies  which is why we dont see him in the 4 minutes room with lukwa and great
gosh my head hurts too much for a saturday morning i dont know how yall did this for weeks

i think the only thing tyme will be able to change for the better is greats demise but tyme dies  which is why we dont see him in the 4 minutes room with lukwa and great
i also had the theory once cause i feel like they change every 4 minutes lol that they are in that room right before waking up like a waiting room for being released from the hospital so what you say totally makes sense tyme rescuing great but dying in the process i could see that unfortunately 


its the child actor from century of love  so nice to see him again and his acting is superb as always also im amazed by jjays height every time i see him its so funny when the other cops look like teenage girls beside him  plus i love how consistent tonklas character is he didnt turn bad bc of domes death its always been who he is i can sort of understand why he took matters into his own hands now only one episode left and gosh am i stressed i cant imagine how this is going to end is this one of the series where all good people have their lives ruined while the bad guys escaped scot free dang 


he didnt turn bad bc of domes death its always been who he is i can sort of understand why he took matters into his own hands now
i keep wondering if kla killed anyone else between the dad and these killings now 
im also sure someone killed korns mom very likely korns fiances dad

ok i watched again this time with good subtitles
i can understand ton kla perfectly the police system is corrupt and the only decent policeman is completely useless he got the usb at night and did he really have no time in sending the video to his phone or email really damn win the only thing you are good at is fuing
he did the right thing killing his father an abuser title a psycopath and great even if we like him he is rotten and got his empathy when he was shot
ton klas look when he saw great and korns picture is revealing i wonder if he will kill korn too for thinking he is covering for great
tyme what a naive fool you are did you really think that someone who killed your parents would let your grandma and you live going to greats dad to show him porn was beyond stupid
warit is the devil incarnate and unless someone kills him drectly he wont be touched by law if police covered for a brat son of a policeman imagine what they would do to cover for a mob boss
i wonder if tyme and great will find each other in the limbo and will wake up or will die together
i know its practically impossible but i would like to see what happens with ton kla korn and win
will korn kill win to protect ton kla will ton kla kill korn for being greats brother
i think ton kla will die like new did in dff after taking his revenge
i think its impossible wrap this thing up in just one episode but after thinking a while i want to have faith

warit is the devil incarnate and unless someone kills him directly
im waiting for tyme to do the job during his 4 minutes timeline 


late to the party this week because i work everyday ew and i am so tired
wow literally everyone in this show is a piece of shit except the inspector and dome ton kla will kill title  which is what we saw him do in an earlier episode and then go for great  hell work out great was involved somehow
the inspector is a bit shit tbh hes too pure for the world hes in ton klas brain has been damaged from the abuse of his father and meth hes 100 a psychopath does ton kla know great is korns brother im still not even sure ton kla and korn are together in the real timeline oh so he does know theyre brothers this is running commentary as i watch
nooooooo the psychopathic smile
honestly i dont even know whos side im on here i dont like any of these people anymore dr den ok i only like this guy
i wonder whos voice will snap great out of it hmmmmmmmm or maybe hell just die on the table does thyme actually care about great time and decisions lobe how sammon always has some deeper moral in her stories feels like shes strayed from the happy endings since the days of manner of death and triage though
oh my fucking god shooting his grandma over facetime is fucking depressing
im ready for 4 minuteception whos memories are we in today 
korns mum couldnt help and you want to sign the divorce papers oooooooft theres tea there
oh so thymes parents were shitheads too and he knew great as a kid aw baby great feeding little thyme
man swirling a glass of red wine and smiling about murder always a psychopath  who is warit have we seen him before omfg find the book tyhme thats gonna have so many answers
oh this scene is familiar
fuck im so stressed is great now dead
is thyme gonna have his 4 minutes now is this him just recreating a memory where he finds the book and somehow that holds all the answers for him so in reality he clearly left the diary behind and in his little 4 minute trance hell read it and itll provide all his answers which wont even be real
i see no way this show has a happy end how the hell are they gonna wrap this up in one episode


that journal is what thyme read and that is when he started his revenge mission in his revised memories now he is contemplating not reading the journal or reading it more accurately  last time he didnt get the part where his mom wrote she was sorry to him  because this entire mess is actually thymes parents fault cause they were the gambling den ogs also that note from the mom is similar to the note on the coffee cup that kept changing with great when thyme apologized while great was unconscious that might be why great saw the cup message changing

warit is korns fiances dad and very friendly with greats mom i think greats mom asked warit to kill korns mom tbh yes we have seen him several times korns fiance always tells korn that her dad can fix things and korns dad keeps saying that warit is the cleaner upper in the family this is why korn can never leave his fiance
halfway through cos i was going crazy with all the theories ive decided to stop liking or not any of the characters and just be awed by their acting 


watching ep 6 and 7 back to back was so intense tbh and i like how these two episodes tie up everything together little greatyme were so adorable tt cant believe just one more episode to go now


once its over a binge rewatch is a must knowing what everything means will likely allow us to see more things in earlier episodes that we must have missed
baby great afraid of woof woof

great still afraid of woof woof


combined scenes

this is the first bl ive ever watched and im hoping for even the smallest semblance of a happy ending lol pleaseee tonkla  korn and great  tyme plsplspls

question what did i miss that tymes parents to blame for the gambling ring


greats dads shippinglogistics business was going under it needed money fast to survive he went to his mistress greats mom the scene where baby great and his mom were playing and the dad walked in and told her his mistress that his wife korns mom was unable to help him with his business so his mistress greats mom told him she might be able to help him she said that she knew some investors that could help get him money fast she introduced him to thymes parents thymes parents were successful owners of gambling dens like the one grown up thyme hates that greats dad runs now so thymes parents are the ones that introduced greats parents into the gambling den business thyme wrongfully assumed his parents were poor and were working for greats dad to earn whatever money they could to feed their family but his parents were actually rich tyme didnt realize this cause he was little and lived with his grandma who was poor thymes mom dropped him off at grandmas cause their business was dangerous and they were being hunted much like greats parents are fleeing from now
its the second last episode and i am confused as fck what will be the ending  tyme died and suddenly he was in front of a clock  i know that diary has some insane things in it but still like what is even true atp 

after this episode i actually have hope for the finale
the woman from the study says ive been thinking about how i came out of seeing 4 minutes in the future because if i didnt come to my senses i wouldve been stuck there forever and in the real world i would probably be dead 
and then when tyme regrets his actions and says it will haunt him till the day he dies dr den answers but sometimes we might have a chance to resolve any lingering feelings  suggesting that there is a way to change things
for me it means that its not just a dreamfantasy there are indeed alternate realities and they can choose which one they stay in but it might also mean dying in the others ones
if great died in the reality having heart attack  in his 4 minutes one being shot maybe its to live in tyme 4 minutes reality where everything can still be fixed


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
the animal cruelty at the beginning caught me off guard i wasnt ready for it its the one thing that i absolutely cannot stand and sends me into a state of panic immediately the thought of someone doing that to a defenceless little creature takes a fucked up person with a power trip i went to lovingly pet my cat straightaway


up top i add the warnings  for each episode in case people get upset by different things  im sorry it caught you off guard
can somebody explain the story to me   i feel so dumb reading these comments i have no idea what is going on and the timelines are irritating me    but ik its a good movie so i want to watch it
will probably rewatch it after learning the story line


is great his dads biological son  im confused 
edit for the spoiler

this show is testing my patience and my sanity
i was up till 5 this morning trying to figure out what will happen next week
there are so many possiblities left that i cant predict exactly what will happen
first of all dr den leaves tyme with his scientific study insisting that he should read it and that is a reaction to the immense regret tyme has after having seen great in a coma of a sort in the hospital and that he will regret his decisions untill the day he dies
and den is like well what if you can do your decisions once again but than differently
if that is really the case this show has a phantasy element and i am not buying that completely i think that it is more realistic cause the events can not change like in sammons earlier work triage or it can why should den be so insisting that tyme reads it because if you can not change it that will means that tyme is like great only imagining things in his head in the cardiac arrest phase
so i am stuck with that and also if certain decisions of tyme can be changed will that affect great cause he was shot not because of that but in relation to dome and tonkla and tyme was not even aware of that
and everything lukwa is saying that she would have been stuck in her 4 minutes into the future thing if she was not called out of it by her then boyfriend
what with the note on the tea in a earlier episode that tyme wrote forgive me great will that play a role next week
i get a headache just thinking about all the possiblities
and last night i thought well for tonkla and win i dont see a future in fact i think that tonkla will die leaving win heartbroken
but for great and tyme i saw possiblities
but now no i think that one of those two dies or stay forever in a coma
i just have to wait for next week
dff left us with a ending that was much the subject of debate and that everyone could interpret as whatever they wanted it is possible that 4 minutes is leaving us with a outcome of that sort
the whole cast is excellent bas as korn was a pleasant surprise but fuaisz i still can not get over it how he plays this role and he is still that young incredibly talented



he told him to read his research because he wanted him to read the part the girl told dr den about the voice of her boyfriend pulling her out of the 4min loop since thyme hasnt explicitly told den that great is his boyfriend den was being cautious and not outright telling thyme hey go talk to your boyfriend cause it may pull him out of this
thats why after thyme read it he went to talk to great and great heard his voice and that is what triggered the revised prettier version of events in greats mind which is what we saw in previous episodesill miss them so much 


vegaspete  kenta deserves 
omg i cant stop watching this gif the neck hold

boc always stunting on hoes just because they can  the neon angel wings is so good 


bocs cinematography
my brain was actually screaming during that scene not only because it looked so fucking cool and bible looked so pretty with that neon light on his face but i was like does this mean hes dead

awww i loved that great ending imo so the 4 minutes experience turned great into an actual angel  the only law abiding citizen and tyme into more of a realist  sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do type of brotha the why dont you stay cover was so good and so gaggy and it still gives me chills 



as it zoomed out it looked like the second hand on the watch and then it faded completely to black at 12 but im not reading anything into that because i finally saw the canoe shot and i want a happy ending

i took that shot to be one that was going with the theme of the show  clocks have featured heavily throughout
but also i think that the watch scene was saying quite clearly that theyre alive first of all 4 minutes would actually end when the watch hits 4 not 5 lol but also i think the watch hitting 5 was meant to send a clear message unlike say inception which ended ambiguously
but if you want outsidetheuniverse confirmation sammons tweet seems to confirm that they are alive to me


cause of death the heart killers 
for the longest time i thought they were gonna inception us they almost did but i liked the ending a lot theres still hope although not for everyone my heart ached when great was be happy with the one you love to korn
im not a fan of under water kisses but the whole sequence with the sunscreen that is product placement at its finest and it was so so beautifully shot
this is one for the bl history books loved every single episode


me too honestly this ending was beatifically perfect such a good show

me too i absolutely loved this series  every single episode kept me guessing plus they stuck the landing 1010 from me  no notes

i had a moment where i was considering pulling up airline websites so i could fly to thailand and yell at sammon i have trauma from dff okay but then it was okay hahaha

ublcompilations must be losing their mind  a guitar  an interrupted kiss screaming 


bocs cinematography
cat interruption is acceptable in my book though guitar  no cat  yes


cat interruption and product placement

the double whammy

lmaooo i also thought the same thing double whammy

i was hollering when the guitar came into frame and then choking when the kiss was interrupted


i am a sobbing mess between the montage at the beginning why dont you stay the meaning in the outcome of the show and just thinking about everything that bible has gone through
ill have more coherent thoughts later but yeah  in so many ways its hard to believe that were finally at this day at the finale bible cried talking about it and it reminds me of all the pressure and all the expectations that have been on his shoulders both from others and from himself im so proud of him and the entire cast they knocked it out of the park
edit
coming back here hours later now that i am a bit coherent to say that i really love how beautifully the two pairstriad were used to illustrate the poignancy of the concept of 4 minutes
great and tyme seemed to be hurtling towards certain doom  and in fact were  and had nothing but their own decisions to blame for it great lived a life of passivity avoiding decision making and responsibility caring for very little not even himself tyme was consumed by revenge so much so that he was willing to do just about anything to accomplish it even if it meant pulling in someone who had done him no harm setting greats other issues aside by using them for his own ends
then 4 minutes happens and each of them gets to reconsider those decisions tyme chooses a world where he isnt consumed by pain and revenge a world where he is a better doctor and kinder to his girlfriend when breaking things off he chooses a world where great comes to him and the two of them are actually blissfully sweetly happy with each other a world where he holds great safely in the circle of his arms rather than sending him off into danger and perhaps to his death
in the meantime great chooses a world where he doesnt take the passive way out  instead he chooses to take responsibility to intervene to try and do the right thing even if it means putting himself in danger he chooses a world where sex isnt meaningless and he can have a moment with tyme even if its just temporary he chooses a world where hes a hero instead of a coward
and then  against all odds  they get their second chance to be together to take responsibility to make a different choice tyme leaving the father alive rather than killing him to move forward and make the best of a future they didnt expect to have
in contrast korn win and tonkla are a mess of toxic love and obsession tonkla is failed by society but also by korn and win korn discovers that tonkla isnt the man that he thought he was in more ways than one and win realizes that maybe tonkla was using him more than he thought and in korns final moments we get a glimpse of what i think was his 4 minutes where he chooses to run away with tonkla  except unlike tyme and great there is no second chance for him the clock ticks on and he dies alongside the man he loved the beauty of tyme and greats story stands out against the contrasting darkness of korn win and tonkla and i really think its quite something how sammon used the two storylines to play off of each other and how the backdrop of the tragedy of their story makes tyme  greats second chance more poignantly sweet even though theyre going to face so much difficulty
ugh if im not careful im going to start crying again lol i really think that the entire cast knocked it out of the park here bible did an absolutely phenomenal job as did bas fuaiz and jjay but i think everyone was amazing  not just the main cast but also everyone in the secondary roles too im so grateful to jes for being at bibles side through all of this as it takes someone strong to step into this role after all of the drama and be willing to face everything that would come his way from the fandom i really hope that we get to see more of biblejes going forward as i think the two of them have developed a really strong rapport with each other
at any rate its been a wild ride and in a lot of ways its hard to believe that we got to this day but ive really enjoyed the whole experience of it even with the ups and downs from week to week

cause of death the heart killers 
not not why dont you stay in 4 minutes 

rightt just why


cause of death the heart killers 
the heartbreak 

i mean


that was so hot 


the way i screamed when this happened like weve seen the nc scenes but this was so sweet and about love not lust

i can do it with a broken heart
this just reminded me did ton kla ever get his wish and was barebacked by anyone
screamingggggg


the literal 

lmao he turned his whole body 
i am so done with win 


win might  most incompetent character of all time but he gave us great things 

hes such a mess my heart was hurting for him while i was cackling  him throughout this whole episode tbh i think he would have let them run away if kla had asked really cutely lol


i think he would have let them run away if kla had asked really cutely lol
10000000

fr if only kla show win his aegyo kla wouldve live happily with two hot mens under the palm of his hand

those three were such a mess in that scene lol and win being a bad shot on top of it all omg but the scene of them lying in the ground was like shakespearean tragedy 


but the scene of them lying in the ground was like shakespearean tragedy
i kept saying oh very romeo and juliet boys
awww i knew it 



perfect 10 liners
tymes 4 minutes was so cute and the kinnporche ost was so nostalgic
and that nod to uwmaatleast this time they spared me the visual
i like how they tied everything up neatly


that moment i immediately thought of uwma


i literally said welp they can end up together in their next life like uwma  our brains are all wired the same
century of love 
dont touch me im still mourning over tonklas death  so devastated i could barely keep my focus on the rest of the episode 


me too me too  i was wanting a happy ending for korn and tonkla but  at least they died together


and korn really did love him 

ugh and here i was being a hater of korn for ages only for him to pull this shit and make me like him at the last minute smh

he really did my heart hurts lol
century of love 
im headcanoning that their souls are tied by the red thread of fate uwma style where theyd reborn meet and fall in love again 

the therapy i am going to need thanks to the trauma from the first 30 minutes of the finale jfc


it was rough lol but the last 30 minutes more than made up for it
lmao


bocs cinematography
simping even beyond the grave

as the camera was moving towards him i was positive he wasnt looking at the pics of kla he took welp



i have to say i was expecting a much darker ending than that the entire last half hour i was completely sure they were going to pull the rug out any second
lmao i knew it


i guess well never really know but im going with the hea

oh yes for sure the watch is confirmation that everything is real i think

i can do it with a broken heart
i bet omega ponied up nicely for their timepiece to be featured so prominently and crucially 

happy ending and more product placement


and this is the end i really like how they showed one simple decision can change an entire story
in tyme fantasy he just chooses not to read his mother dairy and he got a nice life with a super cute romance with great without drama or death
as for great his life is a mess whatever choices he makes showing how immature he can be that actually helped him to realize his faults and rectify what he could after his lifethreatening experience
am i the only one who got scared to death on the boat scene to get a ending like dff  also the use of jeff satur song of kp  nice easter egg 
i have a controversial opinion about the ton and korn relationship yes korn groomed ton to his liking and we really can debate if he sincerely loves ton at some point but i think they are in a codependent relationship when hes at his bottom korn always seems to go to ton and i think back in their university days he genuinely
wanted to elope with ton at some point so even if we can debate about his last action as a way to escape his overall situation i really think deep down that he really couldnt go on without ton
we got justice for den
anyway here is my last diagram of the series i will miss making those
shambles


bocs cinematography
tee flashbacks im in hell

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
loved the nostalgia of jeffs song
im assuming julphan is a sibling


sammons explains a lot here especially that they were experiencing was not a fantasy it that it was a true alternate reality bridges by the 4 minutes effect httpsxcomsammonscenestatus1834641523067306504
welp i knew it


bocs cinematography
jjay is cursed boc save this poor kitten from having to kill fuiaz and give them a happy ending somewhere

idk why their love is so tragic in series if their next series ends in tragedy for them then i would advise all jjayfuiaz stans to either jump ship or riot because its tew much  if yinwar ended in tragedy every series i would log off officially lol
i was like whitefuaiz again died  i was so so devastated i really wanted to see korn and ton happily living together but it didnt work but still the series is a masterpiece


i was happy to see korn really did love tonkla though and i think that one side of tonklas personality also loved korn

when they kissed after they met
it was giving 

well and there it was the ending
i was actually expecting a more bloody ending with all of them dead but i definitely wasnt shocked when tonkla and korn died i was pretty much waiting for that to happen
seriously give a series where fuaiz character doesnt die at the end cuz his character also died in dead friend forever 
ps  another underwater kiss for bl history d

century of love 
not fuaiz dying twice in a row in the hands of jjay  get fuaiz a new bl partner pls so hed get a happy ending next  j
literally fuiaz is my favourite actor and he died in both series i was screaming like just let him live for gods sake


he stole the show for me haha d


bocs cinematography
all during the last third i was mentally screaming take your shirts off not for hotness but because i wanted to see if they had gunshot scars i was expecting it to be a fake out the whole time so i was very tense during the end because i was expecting them all to be dead ill have to watch the end again now that i know that they made it out
but did they whooooo is that lady running the art exhibition the held shot on her after lukwa left was really ominous right now im choosing to believe they did survive but there is a chance when the clock ticked past 4 minutes they died and the boat drone shot was them dead and in heaven
though nobody else did jesus can jjay get a break is he doomed to always kill his true love boc everyone loves jjayfuiaz  put them in a show where they can actually be happy i do love the angst though they are so damn good at it
i can see why they said it was a bittersweet end tyme and great did end up together maybe but its not like they arent going to have hurdles im not sure how many years the thai system gives for accessory after the fact for murder but where hes cooperative and can be valuable in his knowledge of the illegal casino stuff and how he helped expose that politician they are going to be separated for at least a few years he also lost everything but that life had been a shackle to him
korn fucking went through it tongkla was just digging that knife deeper and deeper bas did an incredible acting job in this episode
if you are near death please make sure that pretyme great isnt anywhere near you fucking hell man thats almost another person that you just let die you had your phone right there man that was another part where i was expecting them all to be dead and i would have been so sad that lukwa and den didnt have their happy ending
honestly id be kind of hardcore down for a fasai centric show where she goes out for revenge for the person who did this to her father and make it a gl where evil people are doing evil things and they are just bad people all around
wow you guys im so blown away this finale was perfection cant believe they wrapped up everything so neatly its a 1010 for me and the ending in the boat and the kp song was the cherry on top
and yes there is love and romance and yes were alive and not stuck in the loop  well rip tonkla but at least you got  revenge and your mans back rip korn you had a great  and you were a beautiful crier
thank you uthoughtsallday for that amazing onair experience and thank you all for letting me have the time of my life enjoying all those exciting discussions speculations and all the nasty with you 

im sold on basfuaiz can we get more of them

dafuq there was a huge lump on my chest the first 16 minutes of the episode  because of great and tyme
then i went on to hold my breath because of korn and tonkla  30 minutes in and im a mess i didnt know i was rooting this hard for korn and tonkla
and this episode affirmed to me that great was a pos before his 4 minutes
now i want to go canoodle in a canoe with my beau
i didnt know i needed why dont you stay rendition by jes
i can do it with a broken heart
well i like it when a series neatly ties all loose ends in a pretty little bow and 4 minutes did just that great and tyme are less evil and less saintly than i feared t everyone got what they deserved i am content
huge thank you to the cast and crew who delivered this is a great series and be on cloud continues to serve the industry with higher standards in the cinematography acting directing even setting the bar for bloody product placement and i hope all other studios and companies are sat down and taking notes furiously

i just hope this isnt the end of fuaiz and bas because i was totally enchanted i know fuaiz has a ship and bas has something with job
but you cant leave me without fuaiz and bas it lasted very little and i need more
edit word


i completely agree bas and fuaiz were incredible together

bocs cinematography
im wondering if there is going to be a twist with dens research like they were just case studies the whole time or something the socmed accounts made a post a while back specifically focusing on dens work and if there was a hidden meaning there
also whats going to happen with tongkla and korn is tongkla going to kill korn is korn going to kill tongkla is korn secretly glad that tongkla shot great


so many questions so little time  on oct 12 the writer and producers and actors will host a session where they are supposed to discuss all of their thoughts etc hopefully we get answers there if we dont get any today

so much said here already loved it loved it a lot
not sure if the end was real or not but it was satisfying the jeffs song the kiss underwater the soft beautiful kisses  everything just dreamlike
finally an ending that i dont feel annoyed
the only cliche though  the interrupted kiss  

i loved the ending  im happy that greattyme remember their moments during 4minutes and it was a valuable experience for both of them they got me nervous in the last few minutes thinking they are gonna make dff type of ending but luckily the watch has gone past 4 minutes  i also loved their little romantic moments during tymes 4min it was sooo cute another pool kiss
having said all that i cried my eyes out during tonkla and korns scene you could see that they truly loved each other despite everything theyve done
my applause to all the creators of this show  the writing directing acting cinematography everything was topnotch i gonna miss 4minutes a lot

can we please discuss the whole thingit was like the best thing produced and presented to us as a bl fan this kind of series is iconic and i dont think anything can match this series even though ton khla died i was devastated but still it was a masterpiece to be honest
i can do it with a broken heart
i keep reading how you guys are upset by tonkla and korn dying when all i thought was yes its sad but it makes complete sense these two would never have had a happy ending they would have broken up eventually and that was my best case scenario for both lets be honest ton kla is a very cute but very psychotic serial murderer who used both korn and win to his advantage and if he ever had any deep feelings for korn im not sure these were really all there by the end korn is a weak accessory to murder torture gambling and whatnot who dropped everything like a hot potato at the first sign of struggle and win became a corrupt policeman after all because of his desire for ton kla he would so have let this man escape we all know this


i agree this was the ending however i kinda did wish for win to let them go and kla and korn be out on the run doing it raw forever and always 

happy endingg bitchezzzzz

ill miss this brilliant series and the on air thread theories the whole time i was waiting for a dff style twist the scenes with great and tyme were very romantic they are beautiful together i dont know why but i wasnt as invested in their ending maybe because it was obvious they would end up together maybe too much guitar and not enough making out i dont know
now ton and korn are a different story was it love i think so in their own twisted way but regardless they were so good on screen together omg that kiss their tragic violent ending made sense for them even though i wanted them to be on the run forever the kinnporche nostalgia at the end was beautiful i need more psychological bls like this

earthmix 


how will they wrap it all up

well i think we can all agree win is not cut out for police work  hes pretty gullible although given tonklas hotness did he really have a choice  thats the real question i think

ive been riding for korntonkla since episode one but i think i rode a little too close to the sun i wanted them together in the end though so i guess i got what i wanted 


omg okay i havent cried in a long time but the minute jeffs song started playing the flood gates opened what a lovely ending also korn and tonkla had me on the verge  the acting from bas was superb this shot in particular from jes and bible was so beautiful all in all im happy our two main characters got a happy ending and a beautiful boat kiss  ill miss them so much


bas crying was exceptional



cause of death the heart killers 
im home and ready to watch it live 


ready too but i will probably lurk here for spoilers first so i can be prepared 


im still sobbing my korntonkla 
i hope that bible and jes work together again soon

did tonkla really have to mention the cheating


i think he did it for me i needed him to tell korn that for my own peace of mind


vegaspete  kenta deserves 
i forgot it was friday and that episodes air on fridays sigh id like my free time back



i cannot wait to read the variety of opinions on the ending and the series as a whole i imagine it will be wildly divisive and i cant wait to read the rants and raves 
i personally wound up really like 4 minutes while completely understanding why others may not and agreeing with many criticisms of it 
my favorite character korn
ugh the way i love a flawed morally dark grey sad boy who cries it may be a problem i think korn wanted to be a good guy but didnt have the courage to be i think he genuinely loved kla but was weak selfish and scared he tried to live up to his familys expectations feeling pressure as the eldest but was just bad at it he was bad at being good and bad at being bad but superb at fucking up and being alone lost and confused i think emotionally in terms of how alone he felt with no place to turn not feeling proud of his actions but not knowing what to do regretting too late how he treated the people he loved  i related most to korni wonder how dark my grey is huh worrying
my favorite tymexgreat tymes
og pre4m tyme and great werent really in love and had illtimed bathroom breaks i liked their chemistry at the noodle spot but it didnt go anywhere 
greats tyme and great were lacking in scorching hot chemistry and were too awkward for me i didnt like the virginal awkward bro vibe  
post 4minutes tyme and great were actually pretty good still had a bit of bro energy but i felt their connectedness not bad
tymes version though  just right for me maybe because it was just a montage and they didnt ruin it by like talking but they had a flirty romantic loved up vibe that was neither without heart nor with too much awkward energy the spooning was divine they seemed at ease and i believed them as a romantic pair plus the montage left me wanting more so that made me feel like maybe in the right circumstances which will never happen in any universe of multiverses jes and bible could have been a great couple the dream is kept alive for me 
my favorite actor bas
i felt like bas had fantastic microexpressions that made me understand his inner conflict and his love for kla however they must have been waaaaay too micro because so many folks didnt pick up on them and see him as a jerk to the end so maybe bas wasnt all that great if were not all seeing the same thing or maybe thats just the nature of the kind of character korn was but for me bas played a difficult character really well and his final scene made me cry i was heartbroken for him which you know maybe this is  more about my terrible taste in men than anything else 
my favorite scene tyme stitching great great ver
at the end of the day this scene  while basically a complete scam and a total lie as we did not see this chemistry develop later in greats ver  was the most enjoyable moment it made me giggle it brought my expectations up it made me feel chemistry and flirtatiousness it was well done it was total bait and i resent it in many ways but as a standalone scene it was a feelgood scene that made me feel butterflies
my second favorite scene was kla and korns last scene  from klas admission to wins patheticness to korns breakdown i felt that while cliche it was shakespearean tragic in a good way and i really liked it i know others hated it beyond belief and i do not disagree  cliche tired lame on many levels for me i dont mind a cliche and i thought it was a good use of a cliche tragic ending
my least favorite moment tyme and great nc scene  og ver
this was a scene i was really looking forward to i thought we were going to see two people truly attracted to each other connected in an unexplained way longing for closeness overwhelmed by passion we got none of that and i remain pissed i will never get over how we were baited here this was about selling us a lie in teasers and i think jes had some contract about showing off only good sides of himself and it was absolutely disingenuous and i cannot release my rage over it 
my second least favorite moment was tyme and greats nc scene in greats ver i am just not a fan of awkward embarrassed virginal sex scenes 

i love your take on korn he was a really interesting character and definitely kudos to bas for portraying him so well the thing that broke my heart the most was that at his lowest point korn finally felt free to pursue what he really wanted no longer being afraid and wanting to run away with ton kla except it was much much too late
also kudos to bible for portraying what felt like three different versions of great  the one in greats head the one in reality and the one in tymes head the one in tymes head is definitely the most sweet and charming version which makes sense given that tyme is falling in love but all this to say i loved the version of them in tymes head the most too it was the first time i thought i really wish we got more of them together on this show their chemistry was impeccable there

i agree with almost all your points loved baskorn i do think on the awkward nc scene from greats 4 minutes its truly meant to be so awkward because great is a big baby and had never been in love before and actually fell for tyme so he envisioned this childish awkward moment when trying to fix it i didnt like it until their real nc scene and then seeing tymes versionit all came together for me and honestly ill take any version of jes and bible because dear god they are attractive men and dont make me feel like im watching little boys like some of these shows do idk i understand why people are mad about that ep 4 scene but for me it showed so much about great and the story

the way i squealed when tyme put his hand on greats

that last scene of them in the boat wearing black and white was so lovely

i knew korn would do that i knew it 
the moment tonkla fell to the ground dead i knew korn would take the gun and off himself
anyways that scene wasnt inside the 4 minutes but some random day where great met that woman weird
my heart stopped when they stared at the watch by the end not sure if theyre awake or not inception style ugh
anyways do we know if jes and bible will be a couple in another show or bible will keep doing bl with different ppl this was way too short and i need more bible stat 
wtf was that ending my baby tonkla

earthmix 
i have no words literally english is eluding me i loved everything about it the story the characters the actors the direction the cinematography i have zero complaints discovering jes for me was just a bonus im feeling bereft now that it has ended i was not fucking prepared for bas blowing my fucking mind with his devastation fuaiz deserves all of the awards im emotional im all over the place




its a happy ending for those who came for greattyme
for those who stayed for kornkla we are in mourning and beyond devastated 

one more nc scene with tonkla and korn before they got caught by the popo wouldve been cherry on top

the sunsetsunrise shot ugh so good yes i cant stop rewatching tymes 4minutes its so heartwarming 


i think every rewatch will uncover more missed details so let us know
this shot was beautiful and those paintings have to mean something related to the characters


cherry magic 
i will only watch it tomorrow  i cant wait


happy cake day


 who thinks they got out of the 4 minute zone
and the lady in charge of the 4 minute exhibition who is she
if great and tyme did survive what a tragic end to tonkla and korn
ugh so we have an open ended ending like dead best friend forever 
boc does it again and i lovehate them for it


bocs cinematography
i had forgotten about the art exhibition woman and id thought they did get out but maybe the clock ticking past the four minutes means they truly are dead and in heaven where they can finally be happy i dont know right now thats what im choosing to believe


thanks for the spoilers seems as its safer than i thought to go in


i added the warnings  up top

even when this whole thing ended i was waiting for ton and korn to pop out from somewhere

well that happened a lot im still confused about and some things i totally predicted
i wish we had 10 eps bc i feel like we needed to see more
i want a 10 minutes love scene with the real and happy in love greattyme i feel slightly disappointed we didnt get any sultriness in this ep we were promised sultry but all we got was tonkla and win and korns ass where is the greattyme pls


where is the greattyme pls
this was missing from the entire series they forgot to add it in 


 asking the real questions


i liked the ending whether it was real or not at least one couple is probably happy somewhere maybe both  one in the real world and one in the afterlife much better than the bloodbath i was expecting

now i can rewatch this masterpiece and enjoy the entire story again the ending was beautiful and tailored for this type of plot also jjay klling fuaiz again  i chocked at that scene doing me a bambooze near the end too on the boat i thought it was gonna end like dff  but im very satisfied with the ending 

tyme redoing his meeting with great was just so sweet and heart breaking it was apparent how much he wanted a healthy rs and treasure great if things went differently 


i am not okay the happiness montageending to why dont you stay from kinnporsche omg  that song makes me want to cry on a good day but paired with this finale damn  i was expecting a really sad ending so pleasantly surprised with what we got never getting over ton kla and korn i was unexpectedly wrecked there
that was really excellent stuff though it was unpredictable and had me throughly gripped

the happiest ive been with a bl ending what a tragedy for clyde and clyde  ton  korn lol


omg someone put born to die as a fan made mv for korn and tonkla and i cried omg yall



i was confused until the end but from what i got this was a story about near death experiences and that there were no actual powers the real power was both of them inventing having a romance in their own 4 minutes  though i cant say im completely satisfied with this ending maybe it needed a few more eps to completely tie everything up
overall it was a great series jesbible had insane chemistry i hope they do a repeat project together but the star of the show was definitely sammons writing this is already her 4th live action bl and she still out here doing queen stuff i am now massively hyped for the upcoming spare me your mercy


very good storyline the way they wrapped this up in 8 eps is still shocking to me and am i the only one bawling my eyes out for kla he deserves better  the whole world failed him


the whole world failed him


damn you said it perfectly

ok my question from last week still stands in ep 3 tyme tells den about his friend seeing 4 minutes into the future in ep 4 den tells his female patient about it so either
greats dying brain conjured a perfect image of a person that he never met den
those scenes were shown out of order in which case the riddle was presented in a way that makes it impossible to solve
tsk tsk im not even going to dive into tonkla seeing his brothers ghost in that one scene
is this series worth watching in the end i think it is but ill say something opposite to what i usually feel after finishing a bl  i wish the writers were less ambitious with their script i would rather take more conventional explanation that makes complete sense rather than super convoluted one that explains everything in 95



its just one writer sammon and shes given some explanation which you can read here which thoughts also links above but you will find that its not a conventional explanation given sammons explanation  that the 4 minutes universe is a kind of special dimension  she makes allowances for impossibilities if youre not aware sammon is a medical doctor and her scripts often go deep into medical science however in both 4m and a past series triage she inserts some supernatural or beyond known reality elements that play with fate time and regret

cherry magic 
just a quick question if great was actually shot by tonkla why is it that we saw another image of great dying with his mother and not in the elevator  i find it strange to show a bit of his 4minutes at this moment of ep 1648 
also great went to the police about domes murder but do you think he told about the hit and run too  or was that already delt with i dont remember
and we were sooo fooled about the actual exhibition  nice job 
overall this show calls for a binge rewatching i will definitly need to schedule that somehow

its because its thanks to tyme that great regain consciousness at this moment they are both having heart attack and experiencing their 4minutes at the same time thats why we see great shot with his mom tyme saves great by calling his name


i think the reason we saw the image of great dying with his mother was that that was the last thing that happened in greats fake world episode 5 ends with him and his mother dying similarly tymes fake world is ending at that moment so thats why the shot of great and his mom bleeding out at the same time tyme is banging on the door i think 

i had the same thought about greats dying scene thought that was a bit strange and potentially confusing if one doesnt remember everything clearly x maybe even the editors got mixed up with the two timelines and put in the wrong death scene haha


yeah ive been wondering why they didnt address the hitandrun either really thought that great went to the police station to confess about that and not just about witnessing domes death


that was so good i definitely wasnt expecting a hea

i quit watching during episode 6 and decided to wait for it to end because i wasnt really enjoying it the only characters i was rooting for at that point were win den tonkla and nurse bee
i really loved triage the end was frustrating but not enough to ruin it i loved dff until the end which completely soured me on the entire show i should have stopped that one on a high note 
what do


if you want ask me questions and i can answer unless you want me to spoil it i will say the end scene made a lot of people panic that it was similar to the end scene in dff but thankfully it was not
ask me any questions or tell me how much you want me to tell you

still so confused with plot nd i cried the entire episode 3



i will follow bas to the grave to the grave i say


me too lets go together

i was watching this after coming back from the club with a terrible hangover and oh my god i cried buckets and suddenly sobered up i am gonna do a rewatch after i calm myself down how do you guys even lived through this this is pure agony comment image


i think many cried as much as bas did 


all i have to say is that bas is a very incredible and fine actor hope to see him as the lead in another show totally stole the show for me along with fuaiz both are the standout performances for me in this series




spoilers
ok the whole scene starting where tonkla tells korn he shot great and then ending with korn shooting himself wow so well done the way they faded out the sound and everything the acting from bas one of the best scenes in the show for me personally because it was done so well


agreed

thats exactly what i thought i literally warned them that i would throw hands if they dont wrap the last episode respectfully and they got scared yall 
damn that was a ride my bacteria brain finally understood the series like there are still some stuff that i was confused about like i dont remember seeing warit killing wanchai literally dont even know who that is and am i the only one that literally doesnt know where this warit guy popped out from like maybe they explained it but i missed it but like literally out of nowhere he popped and they didnt specify if he was a family friend or a relativeetc and tell me why i gasped when i realised that girl i think her name was fah who wanted korn was his daughter she was right anyways 
my heart ached for our poor kla who literally could never properly feel loved without there being death and blood involved and it hurt even more when korn realised that there isnt a life without himlike at that moment he didnt think about his brother that he loved so much or the business or his father that he tried so hard to satisfy he just chose his lover which he should have from the beginning  i was skeptical at first like i thought he was over kla but after that scene where the girl tells him to choose between her or kla and he gets up and like takes a deep struggling breathe making a very hard expression like he wanted to just break down at the thought of doing that to kla i was like my man is on the verge of struggling
the ending jeff satur song made me remember kinnporsche that was such a suprise fr
 ugh it will take me 50 million years to get over this until i watch all the interviews and read all the reviews i shall seek justice for our tonkorn couple in my heart 
also that 4 minutes story was hella well done confusing but well done
thank you for reading

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
tell me why we didnt get to see tyme great reunion once they were conscious again after the shootings
i was also missing tyme saying sorry to great repeatedly for how harsh he had been towards him
also wtf has just happened overall

im still lost ccan someone explain lmao


lol up top i linked sammons explanation she is the screenwriterauthor

bass acting was really top notch his expressions were so good in that short scene


it was incredible i think we were all taken aback by how much that scene and his tears got to us eventhough most of us were expecting a not so happy end for them but seeing his emotions floored many of us


fujoshi
i guess we just not gonna talk about the lady great killed with his car 




will miss this crazy show i still dont know how theyll endhope they dont make it all to be like a fever dream or dead peoples 4 mins before going to afterlife etc also im prepared for the crazy ending afterall its not going to be happily everafter for either of the couples unless wintonkla pulljoker nd harley quinn


there is a monk today

im dumb can someone please explain to me how bible saying he can see 4 minutes into the future in the beginning of the show is relevant to everything im so confused 


the series is about how both great bible and tyme jes imagined redoing their recent pasts and fixing mistakes they regretted while in real life they were flatlining and their brains were running out of oxygen
when they both came back to life from flatlining  tyme because den yelled at him to wake up great because tyme reached out to him through his own mind  they realized they had a romantic connection with each other and they both became better versions of themselves
was that what you didnt understand


sammon screenwriterauthor explains the 4 minutes here


i cried through the whole thing




i got not all my predictions right only that ton kla would die and that win would be left heart broken
but than there came that scene at the lake it reminded me of dff
i was like not again a ending that seems happy but in fact all are dead
so i was glad it turned 1105 and i thought that great really had turned his life around just because of the 4 minutes experience and both are happy ever after
untill i read that they both are allso death what i predicted last week but i dont need to be right
i prefer them alive
edit i watched that scene again and i think i did not pay enough attention to what they said that means in the real world you knew this place already exist right
so tyme says that in their 4 minutes they experience things and surroundings that are familiar so great must know this lake from when he was in real time and great says no never been here i just drove randomly in my 4 minutes to here
they actually want to be in their 4 minutes and are glad that it got 1105 so they are going to stay there in a happier place but that means that they are dead
this show is making me mental first i thought they both have changed so much for the better great not a egoistic person but is caring and tyme is now a doctor who has bedside manners
and that all because of their 4 minutes experience
but now i am thinking totally different
and still not sure now second edit of this comment cause in the end tyme says i thought we had not come out yet so if i follow that this is the real life

i think something that people are missing is that the 4 minutes would end when the watch hit 4 not 5 so going to 5 definitely means that they are alive imo
plus if you read sammons tweet it kind of backs up the idea that they are alive but going strictly by canon i think they were being very clear that they are indeed alive they remember their 4 minutes and thats how they go to the lake even if we dont know howwhy great discovered the lake in the first place
the author said they are in the real life  its very insightful and made the show even better for me
httpsxcomsammonscenestatus1834641523067306504

so kinnporsche exists in 4 min universe as a tv series and jess enjoys watching bl shows
that is why he could turn into a singer in his own 4 min experience and sang the one song which is his favourite from his favourite show



im also reducing it by 5 for the exact same reason just a bit too much head scratching throughout

i was very confused by this show i enjoyed but also didnt know wtf was going on i need to watch it again all at once


i need something really fluffy and sweet that i havent seen before to recover from this


kidnap is not actually about kidnapping and it is oozing bl out if it especially ep2
ok so i havent watched it yet i will come back after i do


wishing you all the best we will provide support here when you finish


earthmix 


i think now that we have survived all the stress and trauma a rewatch with calm nerves and hindsight should provide a very good watching experience with i am sure new things to uncover

ok i still fully dont understand what the hell happened namely what were the first 5 episodes supposed to be was all that an alternate reality they slipped into while they were both dying if so where does that leave this eps short alternate version of things
someone please eli5 


i linked sammons explanation above and someone posted it here as well hope it helps 

korn was greats safe place the only one who understood him from his family and made time for him great lost his bestfriend


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
am i the only one that wanted a winkla fucked up hea  im so sad that kla died in the hands of win  im so sad that win has to live with that and the fact that kla loved korn more than he ever even liked him 
that said what a show i cant believe the team was able to tie all the loose ends in this episode im definitely rewatching this show very very soon
thanks thoughts for running the onair threads it was lovely reading all the theories and opinions about the show 
ps i really hope the gl boc is producing will be up to par with what theyve been doing i hope the fls will be as messy as all the characters theyve given us so far in dff 4 minutes and kp


thank you for all your contributions every week

i dont get this show


its definitely not for everyone i am sure there is another bl that fits you perfectly 

oh my god the way i held my breath until the end bas the actor you are i felt so bad for korn and tonkla even they deserved better in this lifetime greattyme reunited at last i was bracing myself for a sad ending tbh but they surprised me esp when they were looking at the goddamn watch in the final scene i thought i would go crazy nothing to look forward on fridays anymore bye bye 4 mins


solid solid ending we dont normally get great ending from thai bl but this one landed
i have to hand it to boc they make great shows i hope they continue with sammon



bingewatching this in one day lol im just glad that i waited for this series to finish before watching it also it is best to watch it without any spoilers it was not that complicated tbh as long as you pay attention to the dialogues and the scenes if you are still very confuse about the timeline just go to recent discussions segment on mdl someone provided detail explanations it was a good read
im proud of myself because i mostly guessed everythings right my brain is still braining thank god although ngl the ending almost giving me heart attack i thought they gonna pulled some dff on us hello trauma my old friend got me there sammon korn and tongkla ending kinda appropriate for them because i dont see how they gonna end this happily given their current situations
overall it was a very very very good series  the acting everyone slayyy the beautiful cinematography the ost why dont you stay cover by jes literally chills guys everything was chefs kiss
also they did not hold back with the sexy scenes gosh blessed my eyes i think im in love again with bible and thank you for jes whoever casted and paired him up with bible needs a raise their chemistry 


binging i think is the best way to watch this series

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
that kiss in the water was beautiful



well atleast they gave us a clear happy ending unlike dff
but one plothole from greats 4 mins timelinegreats mom killed by the lady that met with accident they just forgot her completely nd unexplainedill consider it his manipulated memory coincidence like the river scene when they were in a location from his 4 mins
tymegreat got their happy ending but great in real life is a real coward huh did not call the ambulance for dens gf when she had heart attack killed a lady by accident accomplice to domes murderatleast he got jail time for that  did not help nan so the fourhub was the reality lol atleast he did not let his parents come back
tyme did a good job disabling fahsais dad aka warit i liked his revenge mentality also his 4 mins was the cutest tymegreat romance was top notch in this ep wow so cutend natural
also they killed my fav shipcharacters 
my dear korn he just used fahsai also called upon the partners daughterthat warit fahsai killed for korn he snitched on them as revenge lol
and i didnt know korn liked tonkla that much sigh he unalived himself blamed himself for whatever tonkla did tonkla killed his dad too stop it korn u didnt make him go villain mode both tonkla nd korn got their romeojuliet end sighbas crying made me sad wow the actor that he is hes phenomenal alongside fuaiz dark confession to kornboth bas nd fuaiz got all my attention in this show wow i love their acting so talented bas really lived the character in the end 
also tonkla who did he even love in the end like im confused he stopped korn from shooting win and died getting shot by win ill presume he loved korn in the end sigh
korn even was ready to runaway nd help tonkla here i thought he came running to tonkla because fahsai rejected him he even committed suicide aaaahhh oh my korn my fav character died
also win was unemotional like wtf he shot tonkla but still standing there with his poker justice face reasoning with tonkladid he even love tonkla i guess he likes his job moresigh
it was 95 for me butt reducing 5 for that plotholenot explainingreason for greats mom shooting  so overall 910  for me
they made it into a bl by the end  atleast greattyme are happygoodbye to 4 mins it was fun i love this show cinematographyquality was top notch good job boc

have you all noticed why dont you stay in 4 minutes it was literally the flashbacks i am screaminggggg



so dr tyme got his pound of flesh and moredeath is too easy living in a vegetative state contemplating the sins done over and over would be the bitter ending for general waritafter that fasai rejection korn ratted out uncle warit consequences the torture he gotkorn so hopeless chose his ending with his one and only true loveafter getting out of his 4minutes seems great has finally used his brain thus great and dr tyme planned the justice they wantedand great for someone who coasted through a carefree life finally took responsibility for his actionscongratulations to the 4min production cast job well done esp bas and fuaiz superb acting portrayal of the tragic couple


fujoshi
my theory i think both of them are dead the scene at the infinite lake and the two of them lying in the canoe is a metaphor for passing to the afterlife along with greats comment why are we here if i didnt know this place seem like clues that they are dead but together in afterlife after tonkla and the brothers death everything happens very quickly we dont see how they recover nor the direct consequences the following scenes seem to take place in another dimension and although we know that great goes to jail the series curiously ends with that unsettling scene really the ending scene is so unsettling i want to cry because everything makes sense i wont believe they are alive unless boc deliver a special episode


can someone please explain it to me like im five  why did it matter that they had never been to the lake before why did that fact make them think they were still in the 4 minutes


when they were in the canoe they were thinking about their times in the 4 minutes alternate universe they each lived in while they were near brain death
tyme was wondering how did the place they were now in in the real world show up in greats 4 minutes alternate universe if great had never been there until this moment in the canoe essentially if you had never been to a place how could you imagine it perfectly in a dream great did not have an answer to that he did not know how he had pictured a place perfectly that he had never been to
given there was no explanation and it seemed improbable to picture a place perfectly that you had never been to it made them both suspicious they were actually not in reality its like a moment you personally may have experienced in a dream where you realize wait a minute this doesnt make senseam i dreaming so they worried they were still trapped in the alternate universe

finale had me in absolute shambles win of course went ahead and gave us nothing as a cop  but thats fine had a breakdown with characters getting eliminated left to right  but my fave part was def the karma towards the end when tyme decided to keep that man alive but telling that mf hes gonna be heavily handicapped purrrr  laughed my ass off fr but the ending i loved it one of the best series ive watched

am i the only one who feels like tonkla took the bullet for win and not korn because he thought korn was gonna shoot win      i hate myself for loving korntonkla only in ep 8  now i am scrambling ao3


hiiii is there a cover version of why dont you stay im looking for it huhu pls help


in my villain era
well sammon predictably gave them the happy endingcowardand the other was so cliche it was almost painful it was so figgin convoluted that it was borderline nonsensical im just unhappy with the whole mess of this series next sammon series i go in with 0 expectations
i loved the viusals of this i think the boc boys killed it but the writing was not capable of keeping up
kabada


im with you this show is not well made
storytelling art is making complicated storylines easy to follow
what they did here was the opposite  make a medium complicated setup a fucking messy pile of random scenes you kinda have to wade through and nobody who doesnt read secondary sources can realistically follow
as always the first couple episodes were cool and intriguing but the second half what a complete shit show
