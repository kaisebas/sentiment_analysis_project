help 

its just a hand touch but
he is so gone omg a mess lol


we have lost another solider so sooon
fuck me raw im on prep
bitch 


ive just seen that durex is one of their sponsorsso i guess we will never see a raw fck in this series 


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
and we are grateful because we need more sex scenes where condoms and lube are shown

at some point i hope this poor boy gets some raw

tbh

screaming


bocs cinematography
grumpy work husband

i love their franship also i hope den gets some too job is too big and hot to be wearing so much clothes all the time


ok but bibles smile here literally made me scream so loud

bible is the cat lady of bl actors he must have all the cats especially the stuffed ones lol


lmfaooo the cut after this had me cracking tf up for 45 sec straight lol

i was dead and in heaven for 4 minutes straight 


im  omfg fuiaz  daaaaamn
also not forgetting bible fuck he is great at acting i mean i believe hes a rich lonely student and not a raging sadist sociopath  even with the lighter he seemed more dreamy 
uhhh the plot thickens 


even with the lighter he seemed more dreamy 
his face and his eyes here were a direct contrast to vegas doing the same exact thing bible is absofuckinglutely incredible with his craft
when i tell you that i screamed
were only 3 episodes in but fuaiz has truly been the breakout star of this show so far the range of emotions he has displayed in a span of 3 eps has been remarkable
i feel like boc is setting him and jjay up as the next big couple for the company more than tacopper at this point


i heard copper is going abroad to study so that ship is gonna be on the dl for a while

i was dying for fuaiz to get to flex a bit more in dff so im living for this and people seeing his potential and im glad that boc is pushing them a bit more since copper is going to be away so they cant do anything with tacopper in the meantime

and screaming


the lip pulll
tons finally in control 


this was so empowing for him and for us 


bocs cinematography
i love a power bottom so much
oh
my
god

literal soft corn atp and im not complaining


bocs cinematography
soft corn and soft korn because hes having to deal with his stupid casino and girlfriend while his boyfriend is getting fucked like he deserves

yeah no pity for that one

lmao poor bb jjay im screaming


bocs cinematography
the jizz on his chest i love the realism

i was very  at that scene hahaha has any other bl ever shown something like that props for realism but i was kinda floored lmao


cause of death the heart killers 
thisnis the comment i was looking for god this is the attention to detail we deserve 

the little chest pat had me on the floor  give him a kiss hes so down bad for you

its little things like win fixing tons hair that gives a scene like this so much added depth and weight it had me gasping 

yeah same

the way i screamed boy if u dont kiss that man u fxk initiated it

the way wins fixing tons hair help

so cute
cute 


the way great is the greatest there ever was 

the way bible can go from cutest dork ever to homicidal manic to walking sex w a fat ass is a gift the actor he is
was not expecting tonkla and copjj to hook up so quickly
also not expecting dr tyme to reveal himself to great already
the time changing is also sus dome woke up but we still have no info from him and title is still running around free

my theory is that when the time hits 1104 its going to reset and great will be brought back to exam day to fix whatever mess happens before then

this is what people mean when they talk about studying the bible i think 


bocs cinematography
i maybe wouldnt have been an atheist if i knew the bible had this much cake

and unto them he turned water to wine and there was cake for all
cakerinthians 4 i think

dr tyme must have the confidence of a god because great is rich as fuuuuuck that car is ridiculous lol


i dont know if its confidence or the drive to get to korn thru his hot af little bro 

lmao oh my fucking gawd the music is so kvnt 


the music this entire episode was outrageously good end credits show boc hired a third party company for all of it money well spent 

that scene was finger licking good can only be topped by tymegreat 
this is so tragic and cute im scared 
aww
gagged him a bit for sure 

not recognizing him even with the mask who are they trying to fool here


he totally recognized him in the hallway when he looked into his eyes but then said there is no way my new boo is trying to kill my bro
uimomen if you slow down the part where they lock eyes in the hallway you will see it 
fuaiz better be getting that baggg with all these nc scenes like dayumm  also let the man fck raw goddamn


bocs cinematography
he is acting his ass off literally and figuratively
hes my underdog fav character atp cause i feel like i know nothing about him besides that he really wants to be fcked raw hes a mystery  talking about tonkla ofc

the man is sad and just wanna be dicked down i respect that

yeah he deserves to get what he wants 


bro the special thanks to durex in the credits


which tells us tonkla sadly will likely not ever get his wish granted in this series at least 
damn it grandma 

boc still has their thing for having a random person taking out the trash be a complete cockblocker lol

the hair help 

i had to turn up the gamma on my monitor to be able to see this lmao

captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
so someone had mentioned way before the show began that apparently it takes 4 minutes for a person to die when their heart stops beating so if great is in the midst of a heart attack and his heart stopped beating at 1100 and 2 minutes have passed does that mean he has 2 more minutes left to live in some timeline that affects all the others if thats the case he doesnt have much time left and hes nowhere near getting his and our questions answered 
inspector wintonkla sex scene was everything i enjoyed it so much more than i did when tonkla was with korn maybe its because i like angst and sad boys but their scene was more meaningful to me tonkla being a sad boy and taking advantage of wins feelings and using sex to feel something is so real in contrast to the sex he has with korn tonkla demands to be pleased by win instead of receiving whatever is offered to him also it looks like hes the only one that cums when he has sex with win totally living for him being a power bottom
cant wait for great and tymes scene next week
omg 


crack the gate crack the ass
the parallels here fire i eyes wide focused doc tyme with a soft expression that shows a sweet contemplation so much emotional weight good lord
i feel a pall of doom hanging over the whole plot so i cant get emotionally involved with the characters because i dont want to be dragged down to hell with them

i feel you the way tyme looks at great especially is more than just attraction even in their most casual encounters
literally lmao
i had to mark the thread nsfw thanks to someone whos a happy gif maker sharing happy gifs all over the comments lol
they are really making us wait for that first kiss huh


but we get a claw machine 

ep4 will likely in my dreams at least include the kiss and all of it at once


bocs cinematography
angry fuiaz power bottom fuiaz nihilistic fuiaz we got so much range from him today where does boc find these incredible actors maybe someday hell get his wish to be fucked raw  give it time win actually likes you and i love that we got another super realistic sex scene demands for what to do actual cum shot on his chest
the shot where great was leaning in to kiss tyme with it intersplicing the future of them together plus the music made the scene so dreamy and romantic it was my fave scene of the episode
can you forgive me great okay way to break the heart of the audience before they are even a couple so as we know since he got into a damn knife fight with korn tyme was just trying to get closer to the family by going after great but as we also figured out tyme falls for real
i love the small cinematography moment of the nude bra on the sink in the bathroom with korn going to nan putting on her own nude bra boc is so good at cinematography that little teensy moments like that really are paid attention to
speaking of cinematography  we got that shot that bible ass in white undies shot but with the music and the rainy city scenery with the two grumpy kitties holding hands on the couch such a fucking gorgeous scene this show is such fucking eye candy and not just because of the people each angle and color choice is chefs kiss
i was so tense for nan when she was looking in the safe how does this all connect im so invested tongklas brother obviously got killed by someone important maybe the tongkla stuff is a totally different timeline than the great stuff i know that there has been some intersplicing but only from korns pov and he tends to wear a variation of the same outfit all the time
i wanna go on a kitty claw date
edit  the whiplash im getting because interspliced with this im on a big king in yellow kick so ive been watching the first season of true detective im going through the ringer with my current obsessions
gag

cause of death the heart killers 
im obsessed obsessed heres all my thoughts with more question than answers and no particupar way to tie them up dome is alive and im starting to believe tonklas brother is just a decoy the same way we thought white was someone else in dff did greats parents have something to do with tymes parentss death is that why hes after them when we started everything revolved around 11 oclock then great got stuck in 1101 and now hes on 1102 we seem to be progressing into 1104 4 minutes indeed but what do they represent tyme asked that same question to den why 4 minutes doesnt tume come across as stalkerish he really asked some rando and great doesnt find this unsettling they cute though during the date shouldnt last though and that ending was announced with the would you forgive me note
now tongkla i bow down to fuaiz baby is showing everyone how its done god hes so good both nc scenes have been super realistic this time around he went for his own pelasure and didnt care about wins the attentiin to detail with the come on his chest that had me gagged gagged boc is ona whole other level and im loving this relationship between sammon and boc its giving quality both in plot acting and cinematography no one is touching them im here for them 
3 eps 3  we are being served

this show reminds me a lot of the kdrama another miss oh where ml sees flashes of the future and it turns out that hes been dying the whole time and these are really flashbacks
omg crack pipe or pot 


bocs cinematography
i dont think that was weed he got way too high to fast for that


i was not prepared for this
no not at all
i know next week is the big nc scene but there has been an nc scene every week
fck me raw x2
full on naked butts
very realistic motions and noises

the only unrealistic scene was the oral sx scene on the woman
wow
im speechless
damn inspector stache is a goner loving them together kinda soft kinda hot 
lmao hes detective jjays already planning their wedding tbh 

he clearly identifies as a lesbian  got his movingin suitcase in the car
wandee goodday flashback to yak calling dee help 
god im dying watching those two theyre too precious 
lmao great is one of us like sameeeee dude

im obsessed with fuaiz and jjay i need them to get their own series asap


fuuuuck this show has its foot on my fucking neck i stg i watched the whole episode w a smile on my face even through the heartbreak

the rebound shoutout  lol


damn poor boy tonkla just wants it raw  no chance ig

honestly the chemistry between him and win omg love it
win i shouldnt be doing this youre still grieving
one minute later fuck that shit haha
also when is my baby tonkla gonna get bred hes desperate for a baby inside him 


bocs cinematography
i cannot see any of white in fuiaz in this show we are talking rightfully so about the duality of bible comparing great to vegas but fuiaz is doing such a good job
he wants to get fucked raw so damn bad he wants to feel it korn keeps him at arms length all the time so i totally get it he is on prep after all lol
kidnap 
i want to give tonkla a hug  poor baby he looks sad and lonely every episode honestly fuaiz just blows me he has such a broad emotional range so natural i want more tonkla
and they need to speed up with tyme and great hurry up i cant wait anymore this flirting is killin me 

we didnt think he would be this amazing too almost phenomenal
my head is spinning  i can only imagine the wildfire that were about to witness

damn fuaiz you really like raw hahaha
please the nc scene is so hot like jjayfuaiz are so into it

i saw someone on tiktok say its too early for greattyme scenes but im saying great knows hes gonna have sex with him anyway so why fight it

earthmix 
im super confused im not even pretending to understand but im enjoying the heck out of it anyway the scene at the car when great grabbed tymes hand i fucking felt it in my gut it was so magical the use of the incidental music was perfect im obsessed im going to die next week if were getting greattyme sexy times
is jess an angel


or the grim reaper

so ep 3 is out now omw to watch it lol


haha as mentioned above i am posting early to give everyone time to get ready  it airs in 1hr13min
this is the steamiest bl ive ever seen and it feels so grown besides kp this one of the few where it resonates with me

same lord same this slaps


exactly the subtle adult humour not overly dramatic it was giving greys anatomy casualty holby city esque kinda quality of the show

can somebody breed that twink already i feel bad for him this story wont end well for anyone 


this story wont end well for anyone
i am here right now but i so wish we didnt have to be here 


nahhh


earthmix 


ugh today i cant watch live either 


the nc scenes tho  im still shocked from it 


exactly nc scenes this good in a bl we have come so far my fellow fujoshisfudanshis

boc merch

arrrrrrggg i want


my theory is that were being tricked and somehow the timelines are messed up
the woman who talked with great and then talked with win was the same
isnt a picture of tonkla and dome but dome is alive in greats timeline and dead in tonklas one
my hot take is that there are alternative universes or tonklas story is not in the same timeline that greats one
oh and greats power activates when he rejects tyme or at least thats what i think it has happened twice now


cherry magic 
interesting take  about the power my guess is that it activates when great take a moral decision or dont take it like with the car accident first he runs and then he goes back in time after that not saying sorry to thyme after bumping into him and about dome situation but it does not really fit with the last after rejecting tyme invitation

i want them plushies


how many are there two sets what about the ones behind bible or were those from a time warp he had during the claw machine cause in his car he had only 2

yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
mr cop saying no i shouldnt then immediately proceeding to fuck the hell out of our boy pls someone give it to him raw already
that reveal with jes was insane im looking forward to seeing what drama ensues from this


that reveal with jes was insane
that reveal totally gave me not me vibes when yokdan met
love when sth unexpected out of the usual pattern happens in cinema like youd expect him to knock great down and run away but he didnt and revealed himself instead i was clapping for that bold move like whats the aftermath of that will he uncover his planssecrets to great did he realize that he likes him more than he should and that great is actually innocent and needs to know the truth whatever its about so he might want to involve himself and help great otherwise how will he explain the whole situation with korn and nan great obv has no clue 


its 155am where i live and i have work in about 7 hours but i will be back here tomorrow with my review when i watch it
stay tuned


 will look forward to it have a good night 


okay im back and i watched it finally
why do i get the sense thyme knows what great is experiencing he either knows or is like manipulating the thing his name is literally thyme time the thai milk tea with his apology brooooo what i reckon these are flashbacks and the 4 minutes thing is like the ability to correct everything that went wrong before i dunno im trusting sammon because her writing always pulls through time stuck at 1101 thats when he died or when someone died surely
what kind of condition is this probably psychiatric great
why are the symptoms just like the patient in my research so its happening to more than 1 person
why is bible such a cutie pie in this its so weird considering ive only ever seen him as vegas i still havent watched spaceless but i love it i like non psychopathic bible
stuck at 21042151 mentally i havent left this place how does this episode end  biblexjes chemistry on point piss off theyre actually so cute
poor tonkla is a meth and sex addict and clearly not doing well boyfriend who has a girlfriend and ignores him brother whos just died no family and lives alone he may have just slept with the inspector to numb his pain but i reckon hell end up healing something in him that korn never could or will or hell end up arresting him because he probably murdered his brother
ohhhh who left the note
damn why does everyone in this show smoke  what does 1102 mean also how does great have the white cat too if he gave it to thyme love his little storyboard where hes just circled sex in red
i reaaallllyy dont like korn horrible vibes all round from him
so nan is thymes something i am stressed why did he show himself to great i have more questions than answers but i know this is how sammon works thyme clearly shady probably knows great is korns brother and just wants info hence the apology on the cup in the flashback he probably kills him or gets him killed or cant save him i just know its gonna be so so satisfying when all of these unconnected stories connect mystery bl is so where its at genuinely struggling with gmmtv shows at the moment so thank god for 4 minutes
actually so excited for next week can we skip a week into the future 


no korn peaches this ep but we got win and tonklatonkla is a meth headpoor boy who did you killdr tyme is avenging dr ex maybenan rummaging through the shareholder listuncle warits police lt col stands outno illegal biz prospers without their blessingso next ep we will have  of dr tyme and great i presumeother 4minute patient from the back looks like greats mom thats her hairstyle maybe

i thought the other patient is the lady dr dan interviewed in ep1 lukwa or sth

is nan the ex
can someone fuck tonkla raw the guy is screaming for it
bible cannot have that fatass and doctor not eating it so im expecting some of that
i was surprised by tyme revealing himself at the end that was a great way to end the episode the anticipation for the next one is hugeee
the only thing that takes me out from the dramaticsuspense type of vibe that the show has which i love it gives it a very mature format is when there are lightcomedy moments like when tyme and the other doctor are bickering the silly sound effects is so very much thai style but i kind of wish they werent there just cause they feel out of place with the overall format of the series but thats the only thing the rest is amazing


can someone fuck tonkla raw the guy is screaming for it
durex is the sponsor shown at the end of the credits so i think poor tonkla will never get his wish 

the comedy is subtle and made me chuckle the comedic timing is so great especially when dr tyme was checking his biceps before he went to go treat greats wound

types olive oil stained broken hip
ok so episode 3 served all the things
cute date check if that was not the most realistic first date i have ever seen in a bl from the cute moments to the i dont know what to do next glances and the almost kiss absolutely perfect
that nc sceneum tonkla is now my own personal code word for that specific activity but seriously can we get him in rehab dont need to se that
bible and jes just get it
that was awesome the acting is 1010 the show is a vibe the story is intriguing im hooked


bible and jes just get it
that was awesome the acting is 1010 the show is a vibe the story is intriguing im hooked
agreed
but seriously can we get him in rehab dont need to se that
no he found his cop that will heal all until the black cat  from ep1 kills all of us

and to think that they had prolly like 50 people watching them when filming that nc scene 


nope pond makes sure to clear the set for the nc scenes he is the intimacy director he keeps just the camera guy whenever possible and maybe 1 other person in the room with the actors
he also never shoots or allows behind the scenes content for the nc scenes

great and tymes date was so cute  but then the last scene happened  and next week might be jesbible sex scene i dont know if ill be prepared
i seriously doubt my sanitys chances of surviving this series

the best thai bl of the year so far





where can i watch the uncut version arghhh


viu with a vpn set to thailand or philippines and you will need a premium subscription to watch immediately or you can watch for free after 72hrs i included this info and instructions up on the post for this episode


i can give you a link to a website


the version im watching has very crappy subtitles and its not translating anything written so ive been relying on the translate app on my phone when i try and get the handwritting on the cup i get a different translation each time
can anyone tell me what these say

the original one said something like you should check out your wound in the hospital and the alternative one said im so sorry great
i was shocked tonk doing meth and had the bubbler and everything i knew he had to be h word 


lmaoo not u slt shaming him

in my villain era
sooois he doing meth is that supposed to be hard drugs or just weed sounds like a bong tbh
white and tee have come so far since dff  jjays acting has substanially improved
this plot feels like a sammon story doctor main charicter morally grey areas timeywhimey mysterycrime
this cinmatorgrapy thoughthe staging camera angles the intetional message in the shotsmy nerdy little self loved it almost as much as those nc scences


sooois he doing meth
in ep1 he was looking for drugs in a clear platic baggy small so coke or meth cause weed doesnt come in those baggies  at least not enough to put in a bong i plead the 5th dont ask me how i know 

got a feeling the cop is gonna be hurt bc they only did that that bc hes grieving right


correct

thanks for all the vpn advice folks ive caught up and oh my fking god


yay welcome

the way this is just a  masterpiece 




the twist at the end like jes just came out of nowhere and almost killed his bro  why is nobody talking abt that


haha because last week we had the reveal at the end of ep2 about jes working with the crazy hair girl to tear down korns bros business so when korn kidnapped the girl and she called jes right before she threw her phone in the water we knew it was jes coming for korn


this is my new favorite show i can not i was screaming and crying and laughing the whole time i love a plot that has 10 layers and is all confusing at the beginning 3


i hope its good because i just watched a sad movie for the second time and i need some cheering up


did it lift your spirits if not try knock knock boys ep12 just that episode it lifted my spirits yesterday when i needed them lifed 


sooo
ok my conspiracy theory is tymes parents were killed by greats parentshis eyes were too serious when they were talking about their struggles otherwise why would he bother with it as a doctor and it is somehow related to that illegal gambling branch also both great and korn are unrelated i guess their single parents got remarried and korns birth mother committed suicide
so basfuaiz is almost over huh  but both are sus korn is a stuck up greedyand tonkla is the murdererhe uses win to get info slowly and is threatening him  also i saw 2 bras this ep i guess i guess they were emphasizing the hidden meaningkorn is tied to his fianc more
also that nan girl is held captive so basically she sent it to tyme
i might get downvoted but it felt like jesbible are too serious in a way that claw machine sceneit didnt feel lighthearted for me but advantage is it suits them both for all the other scenes im just not feeling their cutesy scenes 
also i liked the editing for wintonkla nc scene it was a bit dark for me but it perfectly fits the vibe win is so in love but for tonkla he is just a tool it perfectly fits the characters vibe jjfuaiz are good actorstoo bad tonkla wanted it raw but both kornwin are too careful about protection 
also the reveal in the last scene wow the story pace is perfect i still dont know how theyll answer all the questions that keep on building up tonkla brother mysterywho is he  serial kills 4 mins first scenefirst ep near death of tymegreat also title what happened to him also whats with the grandma patient in this ep dentyme i think it is not of much importance i guess tymes ex that the nurses were gossiping aboutgirlis tyme a psychopath etc we still dont have much answers hope they reveal it in the end
i have more n more questions than answers now

aww i just rewatched the claw machine scene and i thought it was pretty cute hehe it has that awkward not quite sure of each other getting to know each other feel but thats the thing with stuff like this what works for some people wont work for others and vice versa


also both great and korn are unrelated i guess their single parents got remarried and korns birth mother committed suicide
no they are actually siblings half brothers their dad was married to korns mom when he had an affair and created great with greats mom since greats mom was the mistress she and great lived in a separate house than the dad once korns mom killed herself or in my opinion once greats mom figured out how to get rid of korns mom the dad moved great and his mom into the family home this is kdrama family dynamics 101 

i have to agree with you on that claw machine comment i felt bro romance i was a bit disappointed 
i agree with the claw machine date the whole series is so serious at least in terms of filming it gives very depressing vibe im so worried for great the whole time that even i couldnt enjoy the date its definitely lacking the funny moments but ig thats the vibe that they were goin for what else would we expect from ml who is batman at night and surgeon during daytime i wish there a character for some comedic relief im not liking any character rn cuz all r giving trust issues except great


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
i cant wait to watch this


we deserve the incredible acting from this cast we deserve the impeccable writing direction cinematography of this series and ive seen gay men on twitter say they love it for the accurate depiction of gay sex were always on our toes to see whats going to happen next shout out to boc and the whole cast what an amazing show


yeah we cant thank them enough for excelment cast writing and direction

i rewatched the claw machine scene multiple times and starting to feel that great is us trying to claw our way to their first kiss 





ok i said something similar yesterday but here i come again
there are two different timelines
in the original one everything went to shit great ended in the hospital having a heart attack tyme was shot in the streets and dome was murdered by title
tonklas story is the starting point of this timeline when dome is killed by title and from there well see what happened to get that tragic ending where the two main leads die
the great of this timeline who is about to die sends part of his consciousness to the past creating the new timeline where he tries to fix things
the moment great does something wrong or his choices take him away from tyme his future self intervenes sending him a heart attack and 4 minutes back in time as a way to say you took the wrong path dude fix it inmediately
future great just has 4 minutes to change his past in his present timeline where he is dying thats why the great of the new timeline keeps seeing the time as 1101 1102
probably when he gets at 1104 hell die in the hospital if things go wrong again or the new timeline will overwrite the first one and everyone will be saved
of course this is just a theory of mine maybe im wrong


do you think the timelines are science fiction type of timelines or just different pov based on his unconscious mind

biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
this is a great theory ill be thinking of it as i watch and rewatch the next episodes

i am enjoying 4 minutes so freaking much this show is so right up my alley it fulfills both my love for bls and crimethriller at the same time  the story is intriguing the cinematography is amazing the quality fire and jes and bibles chemistry is  i am very impressed by fuaizs acting as well this show is an absolute delight to watch  its so good 





for some reason i have the feeling that tonkla will kill korn what we saw in ep 2 it would also make sense that he killed his brother himself he didnt really seem happy that win wants to investigate the murder but that seems too simple but i feel like hes guilty of something maybe indirectly caused the death of his brother
maybe greats parents killed thymes parents somehow and he wants revenge and thats why he got close to great or at the very least to get to korn then he will apologize later with the note on the coffee for using great but again that feels to simple i guess we will get even more fights from them
i think that the suicidal woman from episode 1 and her son are related to all of the murder or the casino somehow i think we will see her sons death later probably murdered
thymes coworker definitely got a thing for thyme remember episode 1 when he got weirdly close to him seems like an unrequited crush
i think that the girl who wrote the comment thinks that title killed tonklas brother the girl seemed to be too scared to talk about who did it and after her friend i think it was her was locked up by title and after dome was beaten up by him it seems like the most obvious conclusion from her point of view
as we know titles father is very influential so it would make sense that she is scared or it could be that she meant someone whos involved with greats familys business as they are also influential or obviously tonklathe murderer is definitely someone influential anyway as they probably bribed the police
i mean i could be that title is the dead brother but from her point of view if title was dead i dont think she would have written the comment she probably would be happy that hes dead so i say that he is not the brother
dome could be the brother then title would be the obvious murderer from her point of view but that would mean there are two timelines but as they hid the brothers face it has to be someone we know but we dont know many male characters yet except dome and title who could be related to him but i hope its not dome


the officer ans tonkla had great sexual tension


they did

i can do it with a broken heart
my thoughts on episode 3 ok so the timeline of the police boy is ahead to the one we see with tyme and great yes
dome wakes up at somewhere in the nearer future when great and tyme are already fucking so im guessing tyme is screwing over korn for revenge because great somehow found out about his familys real business and thats why he despises them  and hes probably dead by that time which is why tyme is out to get them
also tyme is clearly lying about how he knows stuff about great man this is so fucked up all of it its great 

i can do it with a broken heart
so 1101 is when great technically died yeah and tyme clearly isnt a green flag but using great

my obsession with mio rearing its ugly head every time his on the screen  he has this thing  that i cant explain
and its driving me nuts


i am so confused

firstkhao sandray akkayan kantbison 
3 episodes in im just losing interest on greattymesomething something about lack of connection or lack of chemistry between the actorsits just not clicking im far more invested in the korntonklawin scenerio and greats family scenerio
thoughtsallday


meanwhile the greattyme chemistry has me by the throat  their chemistry is literally palpable for me
its the way tyme is supposed to act i think his main goal behind befriending great was to get revenge of some sort he holds prejudice against riches great is innocent and cant see his creepy stalker behaviour and takes tyme as sincere person but we can clearly see tyme has some other plans his feelings are not genuine at all so ig the off chemistry was intentionally done

did you not catch the last part tyme did not genuinely talk to great with the intention of dating him hes there to get info or something about his family im pretty sure hes the one the girl sent the message to hence the lack of genuine connection
