i see you using the song from kinnporsche and its illegal p
i love bible he is beautiful and hansome and sexy hes the man
 every time the camera dipped baby so did my focus caught me unsuspecting in episode 4 wasnt going to let you do it again and then they did anyways  got a good bite didnt he   apologies to the actors i dont mean to sexualize im just appreciative
didnt get it love bible thoi read a reviewsummary n it was a whole different storygreat n tyme find ea other in 3 lifetimes great found redemption n turned himself inanyway i watched bc of bible
loved this episode it was great to see how things played out in the original timeline finally one thing to say about boc is they really are great at giving dynamic original plots love that they got sammon as screenwriter who did an amazing job with manner of death and triage
i think this should have been more episodes as it didnt make sense the story needed more time to be told the actors did well with what they were given
i dont get this i understand the concept but this makes no sense at all to me i cant get with bible being a bottom either he ia a top
i was thinking the same thing but i think they want to show a different perspective of him as an actor since vegas was so intense and aggressivethis portrait a gentle angle of him but its undeniable that his personality is way to strong to be a submissive
literally just said i dont like that they made him bottom cause he doesnt give bottom at all
i loved it but i didnt understand anything wtf happened in the last 3 eps can someone explain
i cant believe its over this was so original and like set the bar wayyyy higher for bls in the future the main visuals like jes and bible plssssssss let me breathe and the chemistry i need more asap
his fruit basket was swinging for everyone to see 
with its twists turns temporal distortions  thrills this series has elevated the genre into something smart  exciting brave  new this is only possible when you have brilliant writers directors  crew working with a talented cast led here by bible  jes outstanding
full of suspense turns temporal twists  thrills this brill series will keep you guessing  it truly lifts the genre into a whole new league of its own with incredible writing directing production  the talented cast led by the fab bible  jes perfect from start to finish
its was good but im confused lol
oh wow i enjoyed this story the spin on this story was almost dizzy how it was put together with all the different versions was just mind blowing i enjoyed watching great in this series playing a totally different role he totally made it look good
love that the series still shows that even if great did the right thing whatever is destined to happen to him will happen he still was shot even after doing the right thing in all 3 situations cant wait for the finale
guys i get it now i think this is what really happened and what we originally saw was an alternate reality in witch he had a chance to change the outcome cause in this all the people he had a chance to save before die
 but his life flashing before his eyes in which he has a chance to change the outcome of his reality but its really just all in his mind i know i probably just made it more confusing but thats what i was thinking
spoiler alert plus he was shot in the elevator in episode 1 when he steps in the elevator is when all this start you know the seeing the future thing so maybe what he is seeing is a replay of events hes already lived because he stuck in those 4 minutes and not the future
scary to see the quite character ending up being the kill3rlt never crossed my mind that it could be tonkla
theyve known each other since they were kids  for me this is one of the best bl of 2024 jes and bible are incredible actors i knew tonkla had trauma but dang
now im kinda confusedwhich versions is the actual truth or storylinecuz to me the other storyline makes more sense to me or am i wrong
im so confused as to what is going on someone feel free to explain im only watching to see bible
wheres the english subs
i definitely need to rewatch this bcs this whole time i thought warit and greats dad was the same guy i was literally wondering how he could be so different with tyme lmfao its cuz theyre different people
not fourhubxxx 
spoiler alert who was the one to shoot great in the elevator at end of ep 6 also who was the guy in blue shirt at ep 1 opening the one shot or stabbed and dying
tonkla shot great in the elevator and tyme was shot in episode 1
the guy at the end of ep 6 was tonkla domes brother who is with korn and win
is pops mad because great is gay is that what he meant when he said how can you be like this i guess he doesnt know that his other son is too or is he referring to being fiimed and it being leaked
i can totally agree with everyone its really confusing but i really love this series its the best one so far
now did he really in real life but his butt i mean like his lips were literally in his butt in talk life
i think this is the real sequence of events and its as hes dying in the elevator that hes reliving his key moments and experimenting with what would have been different if he had saved those people instead
i totally agree with you this could be the real sequence if great didnt have his gift they are still some holes thou
 the pain in his chest in the elevator the first time it happened in ep 1 i think this episode is real and the first 5 are what is in his mind during four minutes of brain death
and the count up from 1100 to 1104 in the previous episodes is showing the 4 minutes elapsing in the elevator
i dont like this tbh theyre trying to be unique which it is but its not entertaining  now were watching the whole thing again to see what would have happened but i just want the story to progress it takes so long to get through one scene theres hardly any dialogue
i want dome alive tbh 
so this is how the story wouldve gone if he didnt change his premonitionsthis episode was just mind blowing
are there anymore episodes
yes there are 2 more
nahi think my 4 minutes time is up no more for me  im done  dont like this version of events
for anyone confused by the plot rewatch eps 15 with special attention paid to thymes doctor friend researching near death experiences theres a lot of subtlety in the way details emerge that requires following along closely thats my advice
 viewers shouldnt have to watch multiple times to understand what is happening i think its poorly executed which sucks because i wanted to bible
ive done exactly this things make more sense to me now
i am so confused but i am happy to watch tyne a n great gettting together
its so refreshing to have a bl series that makes you try to figure out whats going on along with the characters the acting is great cinematography is great the nc scenes are wow and im so glad it was picked up by iqiyi so i can watch it every week
they level went up by 1000 plot too lol not mad at all engaged 1000
wtf so this is what happens if great did not see the future what will happen in the next episodeaaah another week cannot wait
so is this what would have happened if great did not see 4min ahead of time 
tyme calling great a coward for not taking action to save nan when he literally took action to save his sorry ass no lie when they say anger can blind you great what are you doing sitting on the ground in your cream colored pants there arent really 2 different storylines
this time around he only approached great to use him against his dad i felt bad for him when tyme rejected to hook up after thinking he really wanted him before even ignored the clip issue poor guy he has bigger issues like the woman dome and nans deaths
did tonkla kill title since hes the one who technically killed dome
yes in the previous episode tonkla says to win that he knows that theyll be no justice for his brothers death
yes titles family are rich  powerful and its very unlikely that he would have been arrested for what he did
yes
just confusing story line with a lot of sex
you just dont get it esther and thats okay 
not that hard to understand maybe ur just slow
wtf in the best way i think i know whats going on but im not sure now 
one thing i would this serie w t f 
i just love bible and that sex scene was smoking hot  but wth theres only 2 more ep left right 
 that is some workshop to get to this level of closeness what do they wear to cover the package or nothing i need to know these details
 i died laughing at cheeks in the mouth but true
 haha yes for me it wasaaaaaaaah loved it 
 yes but what really took me out was that great got up to shower after that what did he smell like before when the cheeks were in the mouth 
its the ass bite for me i literally screamed 
okkk now i know whats going on 
 thank you
 thanks for explaining love this
 so ep 6 tells you when he cant see the future thats how the story is gonna be and ep 5 is when he can see the future and helps the lady from being killed but in the process of helping that lady him and his mom die and ep 6 him his mother and his brother die
basically whats happening is the story has two sides one where he can see the future and prevent it from happening and the other being where he cant see the future and he cant prevent it from happening
tonkla is an important character he is so much more than korns secret partner we now know that he has taken action to get revenge on the two people responsible for his brothers murder i want to know what was on the usb that he created in episode one
 yes title  great throwing dome in the river was captured by the dash camera in titles car
 yes could he be a hacker
title car recorded the murder in this episode
this is the part of the storyline where great doesnt have the ability to see four minutes into the future this is how everything would have panned out had he not been able to see those things ahead of time and fix them
this series vexes me every week as im even more confused now it shed some light but still lacks cohesiveness
this episode was bomb cant wait to see what happens nextit was nice to see the other timeline where great doesnt have his power and tyme still denying his feelings for great lol
great was trying his best to get tymes attention after their night together but kept getting rejected
episode 6 had my brain hurting
to me it all adds up the first set of events we saw was just great trying to reverse his mistakes while his brain has the extra time after his heart stopped nothing he saw in that space affected real life
so this episode tells us what happens if great could not see 4 minutes in the future
 yes i understand how you feel i think its a feeling as if he is making things up to accept his past mistakes because he is left alone with no one to love him and no one he can love do you think win takes tonkla down for going rogue
 so i guess epi 6 is his present time without the changes in 15 so it would look like in 15 hes seeing the future but its actually his past
yeah but i dont think he can see 4 minutes in the future i think its all the choices he wouldve made differently in his past so epi 15 seems like its 4min in the future but epi 6 shows that all the stuff he seen in 15 is his past that he wishes he can change i think
so great is just gonna get killed in every scenariotimelime huh 
well he is in the middle of it all whether he participated in or is just is at fault by association he isnt truly that innocent he knows daddys not a good guy but turns a blind eye i think he winds up being in the psyche ward imagining things were different
ok so this is the og tl with no 4 minuteseven though great still gets shot i prefer the new tl hopefully great is saved in the hospital since dome didnt doe tonkla is still waiting on korn to come home when the business goes up in flames korn will go to that women and
shell tell him to leave tonkla and marry her he will do it because hes weak tonkla will cry and mourn the loss of his first love hell eventually meet win at a grocery store and everyone will live happily ever afterorwait so whats gonna happen with tyme cant wait
she will tell korn to leave tonkla and marry her he will cause hes weak tonkla will cry and eventually meet win at the grocery store and everyone will live happily ever after
and here comes the toxic part of the series
 definitely confusing and a wild roller coaster ride
yupeffing hate it now i dont want to watch any more because of how confused and angry it has me
im confused on the story line
this episode is what really happened and the previous episodes show what great wishes he had done great didnt save dome or nan he has feeling for tyme  he has been shot and is either unconscious in a coma or dying
 i hope they dont kill off bibles character great because there is two episodes left and be pointless to finish watching if hes killed off if this is the future time
theres two timelines one shows when great can see future there fore able to change it and this one shows unchanged the future that would be if great couldnt see 4 minutes in future
wow was not expecting that episode  i am just loving this series even more  cant wait for next week 
maybe they will pull a squid game and the grandma is secretly the mastermind behind the whole gambling ring
that was epic thinking this series is just like dff it keeps you on your toes
im early i didnt think id be the first to watch  comment
bro what was the point of that why are we backtracking and changing the entire story i am so confused i dont even know whats going on im just here for jessbible
this is the real chain of events the previous episodes great are replaying key events in his mind and attempting to change the outcome great is either in a coma or unconscious he has feelings for tyme which could explain why tyme is a constant feature
look at my comment
theres two timelines one shows when great can see future there fore able to change it and this one unchanged the future that would be if great couldnt see 4 minutes in the future
its not backtracking per se its showing the real timeline that wasnt caused by greats lifeflashingbeforeeyes before death in which he changes his mind and does what he whished he had the first time
bible is something else such a great actorgreater than his name heresup dad he got in his dad last nerve always  seems that he never get along with any dad 
well color me confused what did i just watch i know it was technically ep 6 but huh
 from what weve been shown i think this episode is what actually happened the seeing the future in ep 1 to 5 is great reliving the events he wishes he could have done differently i imagine he does this during his 4 minutes without oxygen after being shot
 but the premise of the show was that great could see into the future why an entire episode when he cant it seems like an odd editorial choice and just an excuse for more nc scenes it feels like they ran out of material for the original story and inserted some fan fiction
theres two timelines one shows when great can see future there fore able to change it and this one unchangedthe future that would be if great couldnt see 4 minutes in the future
well fudge a whole new look at things however pretty much the same gotta think about this in the next episode which will probably provide more incite great might actually be in the psyche ward after all 
honestly its a problem the way this series has me counting down minutes until it airs that its been hours since i watched it and i keep coming back it is a problem  and im happy to have it i love this series 
oh wow this is getting juicier and juicer
nice to see what would happen if he didnt have the chance to go back 4 minutes great episode
i am so confused
oh come on
so this is what really took placewithout going back 4 minutes
the scream i just scrummed they are building a storyline and im here for it
i feel like this is the real time line and great was trying to correct his psst hes probably already dead or close to dying that tymegreat scene 
i didnt understand episode 6 at all
episode 6 is what really happened the present and episode 15 is what choices great wish he wouldve made in the past so 15 is technically his past based off of epi 6 im guessing epi 6 is the beginning and then 15 follows after he gets shot
so just saying this cause i think is what happened but this followed all the things he prevented from happening right im kinda confused right now
at the end of the previous episode the viewer learnt what happens to the human brain when a persons heart stops one thing mentioned was revisiting past events in their mind to change the outcome is great really able to see  change the future or is something else happening
the duality of bible cannot be overstated this man went from baby boy prior episodes to beast on this one like the demeanor change is  i love this man
i agree   bible has an aura about him and his presence  his work ethic skill and duality as an actor in this 4 minutes is spectacular phenomenal 
such a great series 
it didnt make sense at first but more into it im like  i guess this what would happen if great didnt have the ability to see 4 minutes in the future
im confused with this episode 
wow
what just happened
am i the only one thats confused and dont know whats going on
so hes batman lol
so this is the alternative  time line hopefully it goes back to the other time line
there is no alternate timeline what we have been watching was greats mind in those 4 minutes on the brink of life and death replaying the events in his mind going over everything that has happened and playing out what mightve happened if he chose different
this series is trippy af i love it 
what the omg did not see this episode coming now 7 days of waiting for next episode    
this series keeps getting better with each episode next friday seems too far away i need to know what happens next
the acting is so well done i think this is the real time line what is korn going to do when he finds out tonkla shot his brother
this series just gets better and better with every episode 
and here i thought the reverse psychology would be my own doing 
amazing series plot acting setting photography all connected perfectly my favorite bl since i started watching series in 2014
im so confused 
thanks for adding the full line up its always good to see these handsome n talented actors
