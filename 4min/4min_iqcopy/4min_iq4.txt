Still on episode 4…… someone please tell me bible’s thighs were included in the payroll as the gorgeous cast members they are 😳 Not liking Tyme’s inability to share the Big O wealth in this one 😖😡

Korn was so gentle tender and sweet to Kon Kla, I don't know why but it's making my heart break

If your name is Korn in any series it spells disaster.

SPOILERS FOR EP 4!!! It’s really funny to see how everyone is confused /gen. Basically this ep reveals that Great has created another (or multiple) timeline(s) due to him interfering with the future. It’s why the boy is/isn’t alive. He’s dead in one timeline and alive in another!

In my opinion, I think it’s a really nice surprise. Like I knew it technically had to exist because that’s apart of seeing/changing the future but I didn’t know they’d explore it in depth. Now I’m super excited to see how things will play out.

Spoilers Two awful people dying wishing they could have been better. I really love the idea but maybe better if they had died; traumatising but it would've been powerful, leaving this sweet "what if" behind, from 2 perspectives. Song at the end was a delightful surprise.

I'm so lost I don't get it I thought that this was someone else, not his brother i thought his brother was dead. This is crazy confusing; I mean if he took the boy to the hospital and left his friend there after hitting him with the rock to stop him from killing the guy

I’m confused… who killed Done if he’s dead? I think tonkla ( is that his name) is the killer.

I loved the patience Great and Tyme had for each other. Great couldn’t take his eyes off Tyme. So hot. Can’t believe Tyme left Great hanging though. During the NC scenes, I wonder if the have close calls or oopsies?

Even I noticed Tyme was the only one to finish in the NC scene. Great didn't. Didn't even pull a Korn and used his hand 🤣🤣

I was confused for all of 10 minutes. Than it finally dawned on me what this episode was about. The thrill of woulda, coulda, shoulda where everything was worst for Great and being used by Doc made me hurt for him even more.🥺😔💔

For instance, at the end of ep. 5, Tyme is rushing to the hospital, and in one frame, he's clearly bruised, and in the next, he's not. In ep. 6, the alternate time-line, Great didn't help him rescue Nan, and so that's why he was beat up last week.

It's parallel universes and non-linear storytelling. Great is getting glimpses of an alternate reality, and so are we. Ep. 6 is about the way things would've played out after the accident if Great had decided to help his friend commit a murder, not rescue Nan, etc.
