be on clouds series always has such complex stories and characters they will always be my favourite 1110 love this series well done
like the cats one black one white 
this was a very interesting series although i get that it was hard to follow and i think something was missed at the end my interpretation is that eps 68 were the original timeline before the first 4 minute jump back only the last scene doesnt fit with this theory
very confusing but great acting
felt sorry for korn and ton kla korn really loved him but great and tyme are my comfort zone so glad they had a happy ending excellent story writing superb acting kudos
this is one of my top bl for 2024 everything about it was fantastic korn and tonkla got me  looks like my babies got their happy ending he was saving him even though he was in his own 4 minutes i chose to believe the courts had mercy for great 
that girl is such a desperado why force someone to marry you and she knows korn likes men honey boe out gracefully you are not his type
the writing is still so poor in thai bls they have great actors that would do so much better with better written screenplay all the extended pauses with nothing to say is just bad writing
could you imagine that your brothers exlover shot you in the elevator of your own condo that is nasty work
this episode was crazy i know ill definitely watch it again
dad is a piece of shit blaming everyone except himself and his stupid wife korn needs to get himself together and stop letting his dad and step mother use him this girl is shady too and if korn marries her hell be even more miserable this show is crazy as hell just crazy
dont like this version  the doctor was so sweet and seemed to want great  this one 
so he goes from being shot and they not knowing each other
what i am watching  1848 
how is tonklas brother dead but not dead im confused lol
what is going on 
intense heart wrenching sx heavy and most of all in reverse cinematography thats whats up and im here for every seconds
aaaaahhhh so this episode is what actually happened before all the time jumps thats crazy the writer is amazing
holy mother of god this episode 6 is brilliant this is amazing storytelling god its so clever the difference between how the main character sees himself and how he actually is reality is perfection incredible acting on everyones part jesus christ this was amazing
i am completely lost wtf happened the last thing i know great got shot and i feel like there is a big gap
hey so going off ep 5 now what if everythibg we saw was great relivibg his 4 minutes ans we essentially saw all timelines and now we will see tymes 4 minutes for the last episodes idk
they cant go one bl without a damn guitar scene
well it was definitely worth the wait what an amazing dramaa fresh script no doovers here  brilliant actors and high quality a drama for those who are experiencing life after all the teenage angst congratulations  on a brilliant show x
i love it the plot is so refreshing for bl
i love this series i love the fact that they show everything cant wait for number 6 having to wait until friday to see a new episode is a bit much couldnt you shorten the time thanks for listening
im so confused with the story but love bible so will keep on watching lol
i thought it was just me lol
this show is very confusing
korn didnt even wait to hear the full details of her dad can help before he agreed to abandon tonkla and marry her for someone who is being trained to be in charge of a major crime operation hes far too easy to manipulate
im soooo lost whos alive and who is not with us anymore
okay wait im loving this series yet im terribly confused rn n sad if great or thyme diesis this a parallel type universe where its centered around 4 minutes in the 1st episode it shows thyme being shot now great is shot n his mother dies while holding him is dome
im thinking in episode one the person whos heart stopped at 11 oclock was greats and now hes in this limbo area that weird gallery area where that woman lukwa was in with him question is which version of reality will become the real version 1
 only he sees goes up by 1 minutes first day he kept seeing 1100 then 1101 and it kept counting down last we seen it was on 1103 were almost at the end hopefully he doesnt die and everything in the new tl will work itself out
 great gets shot in both tls the very first scene of episode 1 where the patients heart stopped was greats i do believe his heart stopped at 11 and now were experiencing his heart stop phenomenon my theory is he gets 4 days to experience this because each day the clock
 i think the first timeline is real which leads to the question what happened to great why is he unconscious in a coma or dying we know from episode one that dr tyme gets shot what happens next 
 in the new tl everyone is saved he meets tyme parents get busted but he gets shot also since dome doesnt die tonkla and win wouldnt meet and tonkla wouldnt kill title for revengeidk which tl i want lol i want everyone to meet and be safe and happy lol
in the og tl great doesnt save anyone and also doesnt get shot my the hitman the woman hired cause she wouldve died in the tunnel he also wouldnt meet tyme also in the og tl tonkla and win would meet because dome wouldve died still
i love this series so much so far all the plot twists and unanswered questions i love jaw dropping moments this whole concept is incredible great is in his 4 minutes of cardiac arrest and with each minute on the clock i finally realized what was happening 1010 so far
exactly as dr tyme is dying at that same moment what a parallel connection
excellent series
i am over the moon excited that this series was brought to iqiyi thank you so much
thank you viu for allowing airing on international streaming services 
l find korn is a selfish loverhe doesnt really listen to his partnerwhen tonkla talk to him he ignore what he sayshonestly l think win is a better guy for tonkla but then we all know that kla loves korn
both korn and win have used tonklas vulnerability to their advantage korn when tonkla is experiencing violence at home and win when tonkla is grieving his brother
beyond grateful they hear us out and yall did toi summited the form and asked for this series to be brought here cant believe it worked 
how do we go about doing this there is another series that would play extremely well on this steaming server
thank you for putting this on the air it is really interesting storyline is different cant wait till the next episode to see if everybodys actually dead and just remembering back
yall im still confused if dome is dead or not wtf 
i think theres some kind of parallel universe thing going on
i agree im so confused on that but i think everything that has happened with great is all within the 4 minutes of cardiac arrest he is in like its all in his head like hes thinking about how things could have been different in his life butttt im not 100 on that theory
it depends on which version of events you think are real the first set or the reset
why am i laughing im shocked i love this  they are so dedicated ive never seen a more uncensored drama
im joking with my friends going like no no no its forced perspective like lotr theyre not even in like the same room 
anybody else wildly surprised with just how uncensored this version is im still gonna watch but everytime a new nc scene comes on im taken aback
i dont have enough brain smarts for this
thank you boc for such an excellent quality well produced series and thank you to iqiyi available to international viewers everything about this series is first class interesting characters amazing actors dark twisty mystery action emotional good budgettop notch
 same a week is too long to wait omg
what a beautiful summation of the series im highly captivated and cant wait already for episode 6 this is definitely a series on all levels and im here for it
im a little confused but still happy to see this on iqiyi hard to see bible playing a meeker character cause hes such a charismatic actor
yay i get to finally watch this shocked the actually showed jj frontal nude shot what a mind twister this show is im still lost with so many questions but i love it
 episode 4 when tonkla tells win to hide because korn is here once korn leaves win come out around the corner and you can see it swing i saw people say on ig they saw and once it came available on here i had to see lol
where what episode
the pant drop the checking of the packagethe eye to eyethat smile love it 
im loving this
so great is actually dead or in limbo huh
i think hes unconscious in a coma
so happy we are here but way too many unanswered questions still
yes like dome im confused but i think he is actually dead its just in greats mind that he thinks he saved him but great is not actually with us he is in a coma i think  tonkla seems to be hallucinating because he misses dome but idk 
boc never miss
yaaaaaayyyyyyy finally its on iqiyi
what a way to end an episode
omg yay were on iqiyi now
at the end when jes is running and the lights are flickering we see him having a scarbruise on is nose light flickers and its not there light flickers again and the injury is back parallel worldsdifferent universes i cant wait until next friday
that makes sense omg i was so confused
 yooooo i missed that too
also hes wearing the same shirt that hes wearing in the scene from the first episode when hes been shot
omg i didnt even notice this thats why i love the comment section its like im never watching alone lol
finally its on iqiyi we cheered
so happy this is on iqiyi now when they said this is like an international production they werent kidding the techniques used here are super unique and not seen in thailand that often if ever this production is very well done 
thank you for airing this master piece
