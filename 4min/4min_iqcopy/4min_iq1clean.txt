yasss it was awesome i was waiting to get confused but i got it reminded me of inception awesome show
bro what is this freaky ass show  byee i was not expecting this still gna watch tho
bas and fuaiz stole this episode and this series 
this show is confusing may have to watch a few times
omg first episode in and my face became flush 
its my 9th time watching this series  its so brilliant imaginative  totally different that im utterly obsessed it may not be an easy watch it challenges the viewer in many ways so be prepared to watch a few times before all falls into place  its just sooo satisfying
the nurse 
38 minutes in and trying to figure out the name of the song playing
anyone else think job dr den looks like boston uwma and be mine superstar
so the woman he run over is forgotten i have never been so gaslit by a whole show before such satisfying emotional acting and dedication from the cast last episode is a bit messy and rushed but hopefully will be clearer with a rewatch thanks for a bl with captivating plot
so this garage that turns your car around is that a regular thing in thailand probably just for rich people its pretty cool
people are complaining about stay with me being used from what i could see bible took it hard when both build and jeff left boc you could see it even on camera bible got close with his kinnporch family i bet that song being used meant a lot for him
series was excellentloved the 2 ml and their chemistry
i love that his cat understands english 
the series was amazing     
everything about this is amazing the scriptplot is fantastic love the way the story is unfolding reminds me of the first time i watched jacobs ladder or momento and the acting is fantastic
this is an excellent series the actors were amazing each of them in their rolls i wish there were more episodes and more bible jes scenes i will watchthis several times as a series the kornton kla cp wefe amazing and the level of acting and nc scenes were great
i love how in the last scene they used the song from kinnporsche
ton kla and korn  this series had some top tier acting partly broke me but worth it to watch this masterpiece 
nothwy did not use this song
great until they changed ti all
hi its very a good drama i love it
oh my god what a thriller cant wait for next episode
the beginning of this episode followed the last episode perfectly but than the back and forth from past to present threw me off i understand what you were trying to do but the editing wasnt cohesive everyones acting was amazing i applaud them all
2357 sup dad had me on the floor at 
lol thats cold
yall the first episode is wild already  im screaming 
the poor portrayal of women will make me stop with bl altogether i also watch other genres but the thing i often catch in bl is the suble mysoginy if the show is about men being heroes nonhero characters such as crazy ex victim and villain should also be played by men
 oh thank you i will check it out
oh then let me suggest this series called 4 minutes where most of the villains are men there is also this badass woman who plays a strong woman with a thirst for justice not only that they have a loving grandmother and a green flag girlfriend for one of the doctors
that is one gorgeous main coon and the owner isnt too shabby either 
confusing
espero q la srie continuno ens poden deixar aixi
okay i see episode 1 is starting off with a big bang literally omg
and the nong of that couple is breathtakingly gorgeous 
for some watching it and i saw the trailer for it i spoke about it so like chicken wings so happy and think about it bye i love you kdrama
love this so this can lead to 2 different ways but my thought is this episode showed what actually happened and he is only experiencing the other episodes in his head either way hes doing this to get closer to thyme who in either reality is just using him
the more it gets confusing the more i love it
at this point im not even bothered about trying to work out whats going on just enjoying all these beautiful naked men
i promise i did not see that tattoo 
if you say you didnt see it then you probably saw it
nah frrr tho 
the story is annoying if i wanted a think piece id watch a doc on global warming or the meat industry
go watch those then
this is how it would have played out if he didnt see it 4 minutes ahead either way he ends up shot
is this the final episode
i have a feeling that theyre both going to die
ok didnt we do that last episode i am totally confused i am so confused and is great really dead in the elevator and just having last minute visions in the 4 minutes
i guess this is what was supposed to had happenbefore the 4 minutes abilities
this nc scenes are crazy
omg why did he do that i just went to that clip i cant believe he would do that 
when do episodes 7  8 premiere hopefully they will explain a lot  bring it all together so far i really like it but i am soooo confused after watching epi 6wth
i am confused in this episode
i think all throughout this episode i was either playing detective by pausing the video to put the pieces together or screaming what at my computer screen from the plot twists how do you even think of a plot this intricate jesbible are doing the show justice so well
am i the only one thats confused and dont know whats going on
im loving this episode too i believe korn was selfish from the beginning he wasnt even there when he needed him the most because he was to busy cheating on him i hope bible is okay waiting for next episodes
no english closed captioning ahhhhhhh
there is just look at the subtitles
how weird i watched it with english subtitles
these are some dedicated actors
what in the entire hell is going on im so very confused  is this in an alternative universe
i feel the same way did they make a mini 45 min movie or something all i know is they better give us the last two episodes im about to scream 
so all this time we watched him make a difference chose after his heartbeat that was the alternative universe now the story line is showing us what wouldve happened if he never changed his mind his reality
who the hell is ant
wow didnt expect that from the doctori thought ton was behind nam  this is crazy n i cant skip through to see whats happen next cuz then ill miss a gap or twomy mind is stuck atp
its so refreshing to see supporting characters from kinn porsche become the leads in this show and also good to see jet and fuaiz enjoyed them in the hidden character and enjoying them here rooting for tyme and great 
the cop win is jj fuaizs on screen partner from hidden character and dff mio dome is also in this from the same 2 shows i love to see their growth
wow this is soooooooo amazing the storyline the acting and the sexy scenes just wow im so hooked the twists and turns the butterflies in my stomach the suspense its killing me in the best way possible
im confused also
i noticed with thai bls its mostly episode 4 or maybe im trippin
yep and 7
im sorry but there is more sx scenes in this series and were just on episode 4 than kinnporche 
i like the show anyway
im confused
me too hopefully get clearer next episode
so i basically held this off for a couple of weeks now i wasnt sure if it would be good so glad i changed my mind
dunno how happy i am to see this on here am so excited its finally on here
love it 
the way i was searching the depths of the internet to watch this
dr tyme is already relentless and has eyes only for great sweet  
thank you iqiyi and boc for adding 4 minutes here yall dont know how happy i am time for a 15 recap marathon
im going to start my marathon tonight
i can understand your happiness    im watching or starting my own marathon for the 1st time see yah
nevermind the fact i already all 5 on gagaoolala last night i am set so bring on ep 6 i am sooo ready and excited bible your amazing
i knew great was in limbo  i know its not likely but i hope tyme and great end up together in the end
4 minutes is so much better than a lot of bl series and proves what can be achieved when talented actors are given a quality script with an interesting storyline with a plot that develops over each episode
love it how thais bl shows practices safe sex
true but not korn and babyboy they didnt use any protection and kinn and porsche didnt use any protection the majority of bl couples have safe sex its so crazy that bas character is the same name as the father from kinnporsche
yes finally
