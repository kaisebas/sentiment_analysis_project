ikyflthis ending about to make me break something
loved it and the ending omg  just like superb dead friend forever the ending was left to your own opinion i guess be on cloud have excellent bl
watched all episodes twice still confused
this is why i wait and binge shows i wish i could give a detailed explanation of the story line as i understood it and point things out but they dont let you write that much this isnt the same old wash and repeat its a masterpiece a little rushed but still 
korn and ton kla were doomed from the start  they couldnt get it together in any time line so very sad poor ton kla had some serious ptsd and terrible coping mechanisms
5515 oh man  its like deception dream inside a dream
3200 oh sugar  everybody died
the kinnporche ost is really throwing me 
gave up trying to figure it out time line was awful but everything else was ok seeing bible so gentle and calm liked jes with him they make great costars hope to see them all again soon jeffs song at the end gold
oki posted at ep 6 n stated i was confused i thought it only had 6well watched all 8 n still confusedlove bible tho
i got really lost i couldnt tell what past and present
i am so utterly confused
i am so utterly confused
so confused with that series
compelling and interesting up to episode 5 then everything goes haywire great loses his 4 minute power and we have a rerun of the whole story showing the worst outcomes without any explanation why  weird the sex scenes for once were the most accurate and genuine
why wont my view be allowed to enter 
im so confused about episode six
absolutely fantastic show best time travel parallel universe ive watched
wow that was a seriously twisted story i loved it really well done and nice having a mature story that still comes across as bl kudos to everyone involved
oh im speechless this was so much better than i anticipated the story  concept were executed beautifully  1010 seriously  im so mad its over but so happy it happened and i got to watch it
wow just wow 
a master reality of decisions this should teach us to think very well before acting we dont have turning backs great actors hope to seeing the again soon
the story had some abrupt segue ways but i didnt hate it i honestly wasnt sure how this was going to end and thats pretty rare for me  i do hope we start seeing more bl like this
the ending song being a song that was used in kp made me want to cry because this is now the second time i have had to see bible die and come back amazing series and an amazing actor multiple amazing actors but i will love bible forever
missed you bible 
if i have to give this series a thesis title it would be the interdependency correlation and dichotomy between fate and the consequences of our decisions on realityits a bl like no otherthe actors deserve all their flowers all the way 
i want to see more shows like this that dont compromise having a fully fleshed storyline with amazing twists and turns for the sake of a beautiful love story too 4 minutes is proof you can have both
i really enjoyed this series its great to watch a bl that puts so much work into creating an intricate and interesting storyline if theres anything you can take away from this show its that there is always another choice to make whether it be hard or easy it is there
pt 14 last update thanks for reading all of my comments i just had to get it off my chest because it was also very confusing and i didnt understand till the next morning overall very cool storyline but i wish things went better
pt 13 it makes us upset that it didnt end up like the first 2 episodes great didnt mean to hurt or get anybody killed but he also didnt do anything about it when he saw it happening but i can understand how he could have felt helpless
i think youre missing the point of the drama he has no such thing as powers  his 4 minutes were simply him reliving life  removing his regrets in the 4 minutes before becoming brain dead having a superpower doesnt make u great redeeming yourself does  taking accountability
pt 11 boyfriend couldnt be together maybe they could have their own 4 minutes usually in dramas it shows you how the main character made all the bad choices and then dies and then able to go back in time and make the right choices but this one did the opposite and it kind of
pt 11 i like that the 2 of them are together but i dont get how time could be okay with great stopping his parents from coming back to thailand because they killed a lot of people they should go to prison im sad that dome didnt get to live and grates brother and his 
pt 10 dome died and grates brothers boyfriend got his revenge and really did die with him as they got shot and thats where you see time and great grief for their loved ones grandma is dead brother and brothers boyfriend dead parents are on the run out of thailand
pt 9 upon his revenge and thats where you see him have all these happy lovey moments with great but then when he comes back you start to see that the beginning of the 2 episodes didnt really happen it was just an altar universe of what could have happened but really
pt 8 relationship and in the backstory his grandma did get killed by the guys of greats family and he did get shot and as his friend was trying to save him and bring him back time didnt get 4 minutes like he did he just lived in a different universe where he never acted
pt 7 so in the real reality he is in the hospital recovering from being shot from the elevator and time didnt want a relationship with him he was just using him to get back at his dad even though gray didnt care wanted to have a
pt 6 thats where it started his powers so he really got shot in the elevator and died and thats when he got the powers and went back in time but the first time when he made all the right choices he got shot saving his mom so in the real reality hes in the hospital now
pt 5 and dome actually died the real reality is great hit that woman help his friend kill dome though he didnt actually kill him he let happen and nan died in and he never saved her and that guy that his brother was in love with did shoot him in the elevator addis condo
pt 4 and youre able to go back and change the things that you couldnt before and then we get into the episodes where i dont like it but basically in the beginning great his choices that were good he never made those choices he made the wrong choices in every situation
pt 3 and then in the next couple of episodes you see the conversation and talk that the lady is saying during the art gallery about when your heart stops your brain can survive for 4 minutes and when that happens sometimes you can receive superpowers like seeing the future
pt 2 choice and saving the people who were going to get hurt and it all starts with time giving him that tai tea in the message was go heal your wounds but then theres like a flash where it said im sorry great
okay this is how i understood the storyline i didnt like it but it was also different and very interesting so in the first 2 episodes you see great and as he goes through different situation where you might think he might choose the bad choice he ends up making a better 1
bas and fuaizwas freaking amazing in this series bible and jes were great also but the second couple was what kept me interested in this series
all i want to know is who is the female that granted the 4 minutes at the art exhibition who is this person this is like william faulkners the sound and the furyfreaky nonlinear story telling once youre aware of it and lucid keyword lucid this show starts to make
 sense spoiler  great hits someone his friend makes him accessory to a murder after the fact and his brothers lover the victim family member finds out he took part in the crime and shots him the start of greats 4 minutes ie episode 1
 all of this is explained in ep 56 thyme  on his revenge mission gets it wrong and as is literally coding in the hospital he is being gunned downed in the rain and his 4 minutes startswhich runs pretty fast because he no longer wants revenge and has lots of happy
time with great reality brother rats out fake girlfriends father before he goes on the run with his lover does not end well great  thyme end up together even though we have no clue if he will go to jail or be on probation nonlinearconfusing story w holes bible was great
i feel so bad for the brothers who lived a horrible life because of their father and both ended up getting murdered they deserved better
i dont even know what to say it was amazing and showed a completely different kind of story than any other bl it was trippy and confusing at times which made me feel more invested and trying to figure out what was going on i loved it and everyone in it
i have no idea what happened totally confused throughout but the acting was great and the sultry scenes did not disappoint
my dumba struggled to understand what was happening but it was so gooooood
wth im so confused so eps 14 are greats 4 minutes eps5  6 are reality and ep7 are thymes 4 minutes so what is ep 8 reality again after experiencing the 4 minutes anyone help or have there own theories
am i gonna regret watching episode 8 am i gonna need tissues
this was such a good show and it caused so much emotional damage holy crap
this was really good no boring school cant even kiss show actors brilliant story interesting sex scenes omg brilliant and oh so hot give it a watch
the only constant that was good was the sexy sex scenes
very strange series few characters died came back and some died again felt sorry for the second couple that meet their end at the end
loved it best series ever
well done for multi time line story much easier to grasp if you binge great chemistry in the cast
final thoughts i feel like it was rushed bc of everything going on with boc  pond  it was either this or scrapping it i wish there were a few more episodes to get into characters  plot the actors did what they could wwhat they had fuaiz was the stand out winner of all
 there was a lot of scandals going on surrounding build who was supposed to be tyme in this series and he left boc because of those problems then pond the director and producer also had to leave because of those scandals
whats happening with boc and pond
fuaiz and bas stole this series absolutely amazing acting and chemistry 
so good already rewatched twice i wonder if that last scene of korb and tonkla talking about running away together is korns 4 minutes to fix but he couldnt cuz he died or ran out of time either way great story
how fitting that jeff sang 
actually it was jes tyme but its such a good vocal i had to double check 
i think we all experienced an unsatisfying feeling with the ending but i think that is the point those 4 minutes were just a desire to change regrets or unfinished business but it is all an illusion since you cant change reality and sadly reality can be disappointing
very confusing left feeling confused loved the 2 ml but last 2 episodes lost me shame because i loved the story up till then
refuse to read the other comments and dreading the last episode got me riding on an emotional roller coaster why you got to do me like that boc
this ended too soon i wanted more sultry inspector scenes
they are in dead friends forever 
fantastic in every way kudos to the actors
conceptually this show is awesome very abstract and a good show to get you thinking outside the box but ultimately having greats fixed mistakes actually not be fixed and having tyme be a douche in the real timeline just makes you face palm yourself super cool show tho
easily fell into confusion for the last two episodes and i still think the revelation part lacked the part where everything makes sense wasnt crispy enough it was a stretch to make it make sense still have some unanswered questions and unresolved feelings
they shouldve asked jeff to write a new one
jeff had already left the company but there are plenty of talents in the cast that could have written a new one i think this too was abandoned for time
excellent in every way the story the acting the filming bravo exceptional series 
i love bible he so dam sexy
boc never disappoints they may take us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions but its always a well told story full and rich in storytelling and character development a must watch
do we know who shot wachai
why did they have to use that song i started balling my eyes out
i got the biggest smile on my face when he started singing it it was honestly the perfect song for that moment although that song makes me cry too 
love it or hate it but the storytelling is really solid i was thinking 8 episodes would be tight to bring all the loose ends together but it was just right heres hoping this starts a trend in bl dramas focus on the main story and hire actors that can act
the best show i have seen this year incredible
acting was brilliant was beautifully filmed had no idea what was going on would still watch it again shame ton kla and korn ended that way great showed what a stellar fellow he was by keeping his parents out of thailand and keeping tyme on the straight and narrow
one of the best bl series ive seen in a long time i need to see the main couple in another bl asap
confused happy surprised and on board for the ride the acting was incredible they went all out with the production and story line wow
adding why dont you stay was a master play for this drama
i think i get the show now the first part of show is when great was already in his 4 mins after getting shot by tonkla the middle was actually the real world that lead up to great getting shot by tonkla the last part was tyme getting shot  going into his 4 mins
thank you
ton kla and korn just couldnt get it together in life i hope they did in death that scene tore me up and it sicks because just before korn pulls the trigger it flashes to lets leave lets get away im not scared anymore then to his watch full of blood and theyre both gone
yall this episode took my clean out when ton kla told korn what he did to his brother korn damn near had a nervous breakdown and was going to shoot the officer but ton got shot and korn shot himself i cried it reminded me of utwma confusing at times but it all came together
am i the only one who didnt like korn i 100 think he would have never chosen ton kla if that girl hadnt dropped him he was so selfish wasnt there for tk at all im sorry but some flashbacks and him showing up at the 11th hour isnt enough
i agree with you he obviously didnt love ton kla as much as he liked the girl
i dont get the story at all but i enjoy the suspense and chemistrythe song choice for the ost was unexpectedaaaaaaa i llve the acoustic version so much
i am on you with this it was very confusing expecially ep8 i didnt understand how they knew about the 4 min if ep7 was all about what would happen if they didnt have the 4 min i think the story could have gone better
this series was truly so good like every single detail on the story and in the scenarios beoncloud never fails to amaze me for realcannot wait for another one like this
out of all the songs they could have chose they had to choose the kinnporsches
wow  you have to put the ending song on the soundtrack i have to listen to this when im at work trying to drown out everything else
somebody call an ambulance  phone in his hand great turns around and leaves after seeing her collapse  this guy
i need another jesbble project now
the scene where ton kla tells korn everything was the stand out scene in this episode possibly the whole series bas  fuaiz were amazing at showing the emotions between korn  tom kla the pain the sadness and ultimately love the two felt  will always feel for each other
amazing absolutely beautiful but i gotta say i nearly passed the hell out when they were on the boat and they checked the time this was by far one of the best angsty series ive ever watched be on cloud please continue to spoil us 
that was one heck of a story kudos to the screenwriters and the actors who actually pulled it off so flawlessly so many corpses by the end of it but i still liked it a lot great work team
one of the best serie 2024 the cast did an amazing job 8 episode that give use a rolercaster of emotion
occasionally id get confused but at the end i understood it all amazing bl the actors amazing as well just all together beautiful
i love this series we need another one 
ton kla and korn im not sat here in a puddle of tears 
tonkla and korn completely stole the show
over all though i loved it little confusing at times but if your brain can separate the time lines it makes sense
i loved it but i seriously hate the ending i feel it needed another 4 episodes to fix ton kla and korns ending cause that sucked kinda feel it was rushed at the end with 3 alternate time lines i feel it could have tied a happier ending for all parties with 4 more episodes
i reckon by the end theyre all dead the angel wing lights the mysterious lake the song even tho we didnt hear the final line its why dont you stay so im saying they all got their happy ending in their own dead land
their actions were beyond repair if they lived they couldnt get a happy ending 
why dont you stay at the end omg 
yes that was unexpectedthe song also appeared in the middle of the episode  i really like this version
yes right omg
well that was the most confusing fantastic show i have watched for a while the acting was superb but was devastated when korn and his boy died so many things happening but have to say the pairing of bible and jes was amazing they really compliment each other 
i loved it easily one of the best of 2024 everything about this masterpiece worked tyme went to save great in his own 4 minutes i knew he loved great bas made me cry had no idea he was that good of an actor thank you jesbible and boc for this masterpiece
bas was a standout in this ep just wow
the song 
love this series one of my favorites now sad about korntonkla also wintonkla but im happy tymegreat got a happy ending santa wait to see more from be on cloud also jesbible jjfuaiz
one thing for sure i have remained confused to the end 2 things for sure sure i enjoyed it confused to the very end
same i truly dont get the story and i dont think anyone could even explain it in a way that can make me understand
this is easily one of the best bl of 2024 probably in my top ten of all time this was amazing to me tyme went to save greatbin his own 4 minutes  korn  had no idea bas was such a good actor thank you bible and jes and boc for this masterpiece
i was utterly confused
what a roller coaster ride it kept me on the edge of my seat for every episode 
very confusing
this plot confused the crap out of me but good grief was the acting fire i cant believe i cried the actor who played korn was phenomenal their ending made me think of the end scene of romeo and juliet he loved tonkla so much he couldnt live without him
i absolutely dont like the series it was way too rushed and all over the place i do however love the actors and hope they get better projects together
so real user7ec17eb0a
yay
the song at the end 
 1304 i mean no matter how serious the series is they always make time to show the sponsors somehow lol
 i dont like it or the message and i absolutely hate that you effed up pjeffs song the way you did at the end of the last ep you guys just lost a fan
i dont think it needs to be that deep
omg  are you serious 
awesome series
anyone else utterly confused great acting but i cant keep up with the pastpresentpastpresent
im glad i am not the only one it was so confusing i keep rewatching it to try to understand whats happening but its not helping much honestly its still a good show though but its very confusing
totally lost me last few episodes but loved the cast 2 ml so good
right here with you everything was so confusing after ep4 i think it could have been better
okay so its not only me
same here
we deserve a spinoff 1hr long episode of them just being happy and going on dates
this was awesome why am i emotional my gosh great job everyone keep this caliber of series cast acting coming 
boc boys are just top tier acting lord 
yes they are
i love this series i love how we have been able to see the strong influence of going down the wrong path in our choices and how it was always in us to do the right thing not wait till our life is flashing before our eyes close to death to try to change it
yo i didnt expect to here why dont you stay at the end
same i actually like this version and wonder if jes sang the song 
can someone tell me what they show wants to do cause im getting more confused the more im going to the end
i for sure cant help you  its so darn confusing
you have the real timeline where great is shot by ton kla you have greats 4 minutes while he is dying timeline you have most of tymes 4 minutes dying timeline in this ep
loved the series but i dont feel satisfied with this being the last episode totally no fault of the actorsall about the storyline
gosh i was all tearyeyed as great n tyme sailed  happily away with the intensely beautiful song  from kim n porchay love love n muaah  s2
beautiful relationship between tyme and great i mean their relationship was everything before the plus n minus in time n i enjoyed it very much win was the surprise i did see coming but i took it all in anyway
amazing fantastic   absolutely love this drama amazing job to all of production to the actors  actresses
bl of the year
wow what an impeccable cast  this show was masterfully done every actors delivery was topnotch we can see everyones dedication behind the scenes in the quality of the product truly amazing job by the whole cast and crew i hope everyones proud of what theyve created 
my ton kla korn babies  this series was brilliant though confusing at times top tier acting
anyone else confused on what happened to the alternate universe where the brother was alive
that was great regret in his four minute timeline he stopped title from killing dome  basically it wasnt real
what kind of ending is this im so confused
hahaha me too
this was mind blowing
this is def a series you need to binge or you may give up in the middle due to confusion good story once it all comes together but so disjointed along the way
jesus lord this has been one of my favorite brain scramblings ever in a series just excellent the cast and crew should take so much pride in what they were able to accomplish with this masterpiece
what an ending also i loved they used why dont you stay by jeff satur also used in kinnporsche for this drama
i love the series and everything but give me a jjfuaiz series with happy ending
its over fridays wont be the same 4 minutes has raised my expectations of bl series and im not sure what to watch next also was the music at the end from the song why dont you stay  kinnporsche soundtrack with different lyrics 
sad and happy i cried a little
ok now i need to rewatch this to see all the connections i didnt see the first time
i actually wanted this to have a sad ending but oh well in general this was an amazing series 
the best of the year wellcrafted plot kept you guessing and hoping from first to last episode the main actors jes and bible were outstanding their complicated characters and relationship kept the series alive the supporting actors and stories filled out this narrative
kinnporshe
no they didnt use the song from kimporshe
is that good or bad because i like this version of the song
8 episodes i cant see clearly what the point is whats going on i need some explain por favor
 a surgeon is always a physician but a physician is not always a surgeon
i didnt get the story either but i love the actors its all very confusing and too many loose ends for example is tyme a physician or a surgeon
now i need to go back  watch from the beginning curious why they are using music from kp
maybe because two of the characters played in kp maybe they suggested that they put that song in there because we all love it but with a different spin on the lyrics
sooooooo confused
please someone can explain to me because i dont understand anything
wait what thats not how i thought it would end they full on went nope no chance of a season 2
me hears a jeff satur song me ariana what are doing here
justicefortonkla
why am i confused
 hahahahah
i have been confused since the beginning 
real timelin tonkla shoots great dome is dead tonkla and korn are dead at the end great and tyme almost die while great and tyme are almost dying they create in their dying imagination the two other timelines shown greats for most of the series tymes mostly in ep8
dont worry youre not the only one
