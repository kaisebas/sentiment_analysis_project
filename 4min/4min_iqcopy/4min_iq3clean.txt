why am i just noticing that win and tonkla is tee and white from dead friend forever
i didnt like this series too explicit and zero chemistry between the main actors their intimate interaction was painful and uncomfortable to watch there was nothing natural and fluid in them i dont think ill watch another series with them
durex and cat food as the sponsors 
excellent series they do tell you pretty early what was really going on when that one other lady with the same symptoms explained it and i think its a great watch either way but im glad i caught it because then i knew i was watching a tragedy and could prepare myself
i think im starting to understand we are seeing what greats mind looks like in the 4 minutes that he doesnt have oxygen to his brain after getting shot the visions of the future arent visions but is what actually happened in real life
i am soooo confused
did they actually just do that because he  if not thats some really good acting 
i hope that dairy holds the key to all this nonsense grandma warned you still love the series 
hes always trying to get someone to hit it raw im thinking he has something and is trying to pass it along to his partners
nah i see it more in the psychological level he wants to feel the deeper feeling of intimacy and perhaps makes him feel that he is loved
 lol i didnt even think of that im so busy trying to figure this story out
nah its for the condom product placement which is 10000 funnier
what a weird observation its clear that he is dealing with a lot of emotional pain for this character sex is the medicine reckless sex that is its the only way he knows how to deal with his pain
not the splatter on his chest  
the black and white outfits is definitely a thing going here and im enjoying the theme n stuff yall
