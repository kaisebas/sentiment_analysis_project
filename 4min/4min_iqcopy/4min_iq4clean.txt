cause why didnt the detective put his boxers back on omg
the dr reminds me of first
yes ive been saying this since i started watching this they could be twins
still on episode 4 someone please tell me bibles thighs were included in the payroll as the gorgeous cast members they are  not liking tymes inability to share the big o wealth in this one 
me on ep 3  14 mins 45 seconds in awwww poor thing his hearts all was that a peen   the dedication
and the confidence it had the nerve to swing with 
korn was so gentle tender and sweet to kon kla i dont know why but its making my heart break
also bible aint a bottom  i refuse to accept this 
if your name is korn in any series it spells disaster
spoilers for ep 4 its really funny to see how everyone is confused gen basically this ep reveals that great has created another or multiple timelines due to him interfering with the future its why the boy isisnt alive hes dead in one timeline and alive in another
in my opinion i think its a really nice surprise like i knew it technically had to exist because thats apart of seeingchanging the future but i didnt know theyd explore it in depth now im super excited to see how things will play out
spoilers two awful people dying wishing they could have been better i really love the idea but maybe better if they had died traumatising but it wouldve been powerful leaving this sweet what if behind from 2 perspectives song at the end was a delightful surprise
i love bible in 4 minutes he is so dam sexy
ok im getting a headache from trying to solve this i hope this next episode helps me
im so lost i dont get it i thought that this was someone else not his brother i thought his brother was dead this is crazy confusing i mean if he took the boy to the hospital and left his friend there after hitting him with the rock to stop him from killing the guy
this show was insane and i resent having watched the whole thing 110
i love to see bible so sweet and like different
did i just saw a wiener 
ok im so confused and shocked are they killing everyone plus i was upset with the cat not sure i want to watch thud anymore
im confused who killed done if hes dead i think tonkla  is that his name is the killer
what is the deal with ton kla asking for sex without using condoms am i the only one who noticed that
i loved the patience great and tyme had for each other great couldnt take his eyes off tyme so hot cant believe tyme left great hanging though during the nc scenes i wonder if the have close calls or oopsies
even i noticed tyme was the only one to finish in the nc scene great didnt didnt even pull a korn and used his hand 
i was confused for all of 10 minutes than it finally dawned on me what this episode was about the thrill of woulda coulda shoulda where everything was worst for great and being used by doc made me hurt for him even more
what the hell was going on here 
im so confused
i really liked the 1st 5 episodes but i dont like this one and i dont like tyme and his 20 seconds love scenes thats why you cant rate a show until the end
was i the only one who really liked the tymegreat love scene it was so soft and real 
hey yall can we talk about how man burried his dead cat at his college campus in the middle of cheer practice
brother i saw his ween
everyone keeps saying that but i must be missing it
im confused asf anyone else just me okay 
for instance at the end of ep 5 tyme is rushing to the hospital and in one frame hes clearly bruised and in the next hes not in ep 6 the alternate timeline great didnt help him rescue nan and so thats why he was beat up last week
its parallel universes and nonlinear storytelling great is getting glimpses of an alternate reality and so are we ep 6 is about the way things wouldve played out after the accident if great had decided to help his friend commit a murder not rescue nan etc
win thats absolutely crazy of you
wow is all i can say
ton kla is a nasty freak and may be a psycho killer
great and tymes bed scene looked like great got cheated tyme wasnt caressing or loving when he finished he was the only one satisfied 
i can believe bible is a bottom so good to see him in a different kind of role but the big question is the cat that great has is it mr gray his own cat in really life 
hahaha   awesome i was surprised  myself but you know things happen and you experiment to have a feel of how it feels on the other end
lol yeah thats his cat i heard so cute
dna lab and the fingerprints belong to mr anuwat warindej me and who in hell is that 
im assuming its ton kla
bible is so bbg in this 
these actors are dedicated
these actors are dedicated
these are some dedicated actors cause damn
sarawat is definitely hung we all got eye full
 and all im saying is lol
lmao thats what i said the man is blessed and didnt mind us knowin
1505 
you would think that detective would at least put his pants back on just in case
 hahaha     glex i definitely got it on my radar just havent started watching yet you know got too many of them going but i will start watching soon and you will definitely know  i know yall can tell cuz i go between thai taiwanese n mandarin see yah 
 i havent seen you commenting on jack and joker plzzzz tell me youre watching
 bro got traumatised too much to handle   
 the way i just cackled at kittyganglexs comment
 right like putting on a pant will be too much of a hassle  so let it fly free
lmao i just said jj why is your dk out what if you have to fight this man but he real life was crying listening to them and im sad for him
omg right
im sorry but i couldnt stop laughing at that  
great and tymes bed scene was so beautiful and passionate 
its so real and playful lol you can see theyre nervou cause its their first time and they were so goofy and comfortable with each other i love them
cant wait to get there then
