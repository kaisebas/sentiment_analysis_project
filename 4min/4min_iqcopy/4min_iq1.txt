It's my 9th time watching this series - it's so brilliant, imaginative & totally different that I'm utterly obsessed. It may not be an easy watch. It challenges the viewer in many ways so be prepared to watch a few times before all falls into place & it's just sooo satisfying.

So, the woman he run over is forgotten? I have never been so gaslit by a whole show before 😅such satisfying emotional acting and dedication from the cast. Last episode is a bit messy and rushed but hopefully will be clearer with a re-watch. Thanks for a BL with captivating plot!

So this garage that turns your car around, is that a regular thing in Thailand? Probably just for rich people. It's pretty cool.

People are complaining about Stay With Me being used. From what I could see, Bible took it hard when both Build and Jeff left BOC. You could see it even on camera. Bible got close with his KinnPorch family. I bet that song being used meant a lot for him.

The beginning of this episode followed the last episode perfectly but than the back and forth from past to present threw me off. I understand what you were trying to do but the editing wasn't cohesive. Everyone's acting was amazing. I applaud them all.👏💙💙💙

The poor portrayal of women will make me stop with BL altogether. I also watch other genres. But the thing I often catch in BL is the suble mysoginy. If the show is about men being heroes, non-hero characters such as Crazy Ex, Victim, and Villain should also be played by men.

Oh then let me suggest this series called "4 Minutes" where most of the villains are men. There is also this badass woman who plays a strong woman with a thirst for justice. Not only that they have a loving grandmother and a green flag girlfriend for one of the doctors.

Love this! So this can lead to 2 different ways, but my thought is this episode showed what actually happened and he is only experiencing the other episodes in his head. Either way he's doing this to get closer to Thyme, who in either reality is just using him!

True, but not Korn and babyboy. They didn't use any protection and Kinn and Porsche didn't use any protection. The majority of BL couples have safe sex. it's so crazy that Bas character is the same name as the father from KinnPorsche.
