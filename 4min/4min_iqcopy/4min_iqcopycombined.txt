yasss it was awesome i was waiting to get confused but i got it reminded me of inception awesome show
bro what is this freaky ass show  byee i was not expecting this still gna watch tho
bas and fuaiz stole this episode and this series 
this show is confusing may have to watch a few times
omg first episode in and my face became flush 
its my 9th time watching this series  its so brilliant imaginative  totally different that im utterly obsessed it may not be an easy watch it challenges the viewer in many ways so be prepared to watch a few times before all falls into place  its just sooo satisfying
the nurse 
38 minutes in and trying to figure out the name of the song playing
anyone else think job dr den looks like boston uwma and be mine superstar
so the woman he run over is forgotten i have never been so gaslit by a whole show before such satisfying emotional acting and dedication from the cast last episode is a bit messy and rushed but hopefully will be clearer with a rewatch thanks for a bl with captivating plot
so this garage that turns your car around is that a regular thing in thailand probably just for rich people its pretty cool
people are complaining about stay with me being used from what i could see bible took it hard when both build and jeff left boc you could see it even on camera bible got close with his kinnporch family i bet that song being used meant a lot for him
series was excellentloved the 2 ml and their chemistry
i love that his cat understands english 
the series was amazing     
everything about this is amazing the scriptplot is fantastic love the way the story is unfolding reminds me of the first time i watched jacobs ladder or momento and the acting is fantastic
this is an excellent series the actors were amazing each of them in their rolls i wish there were more episodes and more bible jes scenes i will watchthis several times as a series the kornton kla cp wefe amazing and the level of acting and nc scenes were great
i love how in the last scene they used the song from kinnporsche
ton kla and korn  this series had some top tier acting partly broke me but worth it to watch this masterpiece 
nothwy did not use this song
great until they changed ti all
hi its very a good drama i love it
oh my god what a thriller cant wait for next episode
the beginning of this episode followed the last episode perfectly but than the back and forth from past to present threw me off i understand what you were trying to do but the editing wasnt cohesive everyones acting was amazing i applaud them all
2357 sup dad had me on the floor at 
lol thats cold
yall the first episode is wild already  im screaming 
the poor portrayal of women will make me stop with bl altogether i also watch other genres but the thing i often catch in bl is the suble mysoginy if the show is about men being heroes nonhero characters such as crazy ex victim and villain should also be played by men
 oh thank you i will check it out
oh then let me suggest this series called 4 minutes where most of the villains are men there is also this badass woman who plays a strong woman with a thirst for justice not only that they have a loving grandmother and a green flag girlfriend for one of the doctors
that is one gorgeous main coon and the owner isnt too shabby either 
confusing
espero q la srie continuno ens poden deixar aixi
okay i see episode 1 is starting off with a big bang literally omg
and the nong of that couple is breathtakingly gorgeous 
for some watching it and i saw the trailer for it i spoke about it so like chicken wings so happy and think about it bye i love you kdrama
love this so this can lead to 2 different ways but my thought is this episode showed what actually happened and he is only experiencing the other episodes in his head either way hes doing this to get closer to thyme who in either reality is just using him
the more it gets confusing the more i love it
at this point im not even bothered about trying to work out whats going on just enjoying all these beautiful naked men
i promise i did not see that tattoo 
if you say you didnt see it then you probably saw it
nah frrr tho 
the story is annoying if i wanted a think piece id watch a doc on global warming or the meat industry
go watch those then
this is how it would have played out if he didnt see it 4 minutes ahead either way he ends up shot
is this the final episode
i have a feeling that theyre both going to die
ok didnt we do that last episode i am totally confused i am so confused and is great really dead in the elevator and just having last minute visions in the 4 minutes
i guess this is what was supposed to had happenbefore the 4 minutes abilities
this nc scenes are crazy
omg why did he do that i just went to that clip i cant believe he would do that 
when do episodes 7  8 premiere hopefully they will explain a lot  bring it all together so far i really like it but i am soooo confused after watching epi 6wth
i am confused in this episode
i think all throughout this episode i was either playing detective by pausing the video to put the pieces together or screaming what at my computer screen from the plot twists how do you even think of a plot this intricate jesbible are doing the show justice so well
am i the only one thats confused and dont know whats going on
im loving this episode too i believe korn was selfish from the beginning he wasnt even there when he needed him the most because he was to busy cheating on him i hope bible is okay waiting for next episodes
no english closed captioning ahhhhhhh
there is just look at the subtitles
how weird i watched it with english subtitles
these are some dedicated actors
what in the entire hell is going on im so very confused  is this in an alternative universe
i feel the same way did they make a mini 45 min movie or something all i know is they better give us the last two episodes im about to scream 
so all this time we watched him make a difference chose after his heartbeat that was the alternative universe now the story line is showing us what wouldve happened if he never changed his mind his reality
who the hell is ant
wow didnt expect that from the doctori thought ton was behind nam  this is crazy n i cant skip through to see whats happen next cuz then ill miss a gap or twomy mind is stuck atp
its so refreshing to see supporting characters from kinn porsche become the leads in this show and also good to see jet and fuaiz enjoyed them in the hidden character and enjoying them here rooting for tyme and great 
the cop win is jj fuaizs on screen partner from hidden character and dff mio dome is also in this from the same 2 shows i love to see their growth
wow this is soooooooo amazing the storyline the acting and the sexy scenes just wow im so hooked the twists and turns the butterflies in my stomach the suspense its killing me in the best way possible
im confused also
i noticed with thai bls its mostly episode 4 or maybe im trippin
yep and 7
im sorry but there is more sx scenes in this series and were just on episode 4 than kinnporche 
i like the show anyway
im confused
me too hopefully get clearer next episode
so i basically held this off for a couple of weeks now i wasnt sure if it would be good so glad i changed my mind
dunno how happy i am to see this on here am so excited its finally on here
love it 
the way i was searching the depths of the internet to watch this
dr tyme is already relentless and has eyes only for great sweet  
thank you iqiyi and boc for adding 4 minutes here yall dont know how happy i am time for a 15 recap marathon
im going to start my marathon tonight
i can understand your happiness    im watching or starting my own marathon for the 1st time see yah
nevermind the fact i already all 5 on gagaoolala last night i am set so bring on ep 6 i am sooo ready and excited bible your amazing
i knew great was in limbo  i know its not likely but i hope tyme and great end up together in the end
4 minutes is so much better than a lot of bl series and proves what can be achieved when talented actors are given a quality script with an interesting storyline with a plot that develops over each episode
love it how thais bl shows practices safe sex
true but not korn and babyboy they didnt use any protection and kinn and porsche didnt use any protection the majority of bl couples have safe sex its so crazy that bas character is the same name as the father from kinnporsche
yes finally
oh gosh its bible huh and i stumbled here by mistake 
gurl me too lol but im so happy i did
its on iqiyi
omg i am about to rewatch all five episodes on this platform just to give it even more hype this series is amazing
im so obsessed with this series bible and jes are amazing
whats happening iqiyi  please make my time and money worthwhile
sorry this wasnt intended for here i dont know why iqiyi posted this but here its for this love doesnt have long beans thanks for liking my comment because you brought me to this series i like bible 
im glad that its finally available for me on iqiyi
im so excited this is finally available on iqiyi this series so good
im so glad its on here now
finally
oh my gosh yay thank you 
finally
thank you iqiyi for giving us 4 minutes
the uncut version is getting more explicit with the sex scenes wow
im so excited this show is finally available internationally im rewatching it and realizing how much i forgot
its definitely the type of series that needs to be watched more than once i plan to rewatch it after ive watched all of the episodes
have started watching this and it is one of the most intriguing bl i have ever seen i love it and every episode gets better and better thank you iqiyi and cast and crew amazing series
i have no idea what is happening but i love the cast and the chemistry
i dont know what is happening but i love the series so far 
this is the best emoting ive seen from all the actors in a thai bl
damn korn you didnt have to do baby boy like that hes mourning his brother i just want to know who the brother is if its not dome then who can it be
im so tired of these school bullies its getting very old im glad someone beat his ass
what kind of pathetic woman begs or blackmails a man into marrying her yuck
im hooked now just when i thought i knew what was going on it threw me again  
im totally confused
so confused didnt great save dome enjoying the series none the less
are we going to see 4 pop all over the place 4 showed up multiple times in episode 1why am i just noticing that win and tonkla is tee and white from dead friend forever
i didnt like this series too explicit and zero chemistry between the main actors their intimate interaction was painful and uncomfortable to watch there was nothing natural and fluid in them i dont think ill watch another series with them
durex and cat food as the sponsors 
excellent series they do tell you pretty early what was really going on when that one other lady with the same symptoms explained it and i think its a great watch either way but im glad i caught it because then i knew i was watching a tragedy and could prepare myself
i think im starting to understand we are seeing what greats mind looks like in the 4 minutes that he doesnt have oxygen to his brain after getting shot the visions of the future arent visions but is what actually happened in real life
i am soooo confused
did they actually just do that because he  if not thats some really good acting 
i hope that dairy holds the key to all this nonsense grandma warned you still love the series 
hes always trying to get someone to hit it raw im thinking he has something and is trying to pass it along to his partners
nah i see it more in the psychological level he wants to feel the deeper feeling of intimacy and perhaps makes him feel that he is loved
 lol i didnt even think of that im so busy trying to figure this story out
nah its for the condom product placement which is 10000 funnier
what a weird observation its clear that he is dealing with a lot of emotional pain for this character sex is the medicine reckless sex that is its the only way he knows how to deal with his pain
not the splatter on his chest  
the black and white outfits is definitely a thing going here and im enjoying the theme n stuff yall 
rune thigh tatts at 4133 
gurlll they have all the fine men in herecause why didnt the detective put his boxers back on omg
the dr reminds me of first
yes ive been saying this since i started watching this they could be twins
still on episode 4 someone please tell me bibles thighs were included in the payroll as the gorgeous cast members they are  not liking tymes inability to share the big o wealth in this one 
me on ep 3  14 mins 45 seconds in awwww poor thing his hearts all was that a peen   the dedication
and the confidence it had the nerve to swing with 
korn was so gentle tender and sweet to kon kla i dont know why but its making my heart break
also bible aint a bottom  i refuse to accept this 
if your name is korn in any series it spells disaster
spoilers for ep 4 its really funny to see how everyone is confused gen basically this ep reveals that great has created another or multiple timelines due to him interfering with the future its why the boy isisnt alive hes dead in one timeline and alive in another
in my opinion i think its a really nice surprise like i knew it technically had to exist because thats apart of seeingchanging the future but i didnt know theyd explore it in depth now im super excited to see how things will play out
spoilers two awful people dying wishing they could have been better i really love the idea but maybe better if they had died traumatising but it wouldve been powerful leaving this sweet what if behind from 2 perspectives song at the end was a delightful surprise
i love bible in 4 minutes he is so dam sexy
ok im getting a headache from trying to solve this i hope this next episode helps me
im so lost i dont get it i thought that this was someone else not his brother i thought his brother was dead this is crazy confusing i mean if he took the boy to the hospital and left his friend there after hitting him with the rock to stop him from killing the guy
this show was insane and i resent having watched the whole thing 110
i love to see bible so sweet and like different
did i just saw a wiener 
ok im so confused and shocked are they killing everyone plus i was upset with the cat not sure i want to watch thud anymore
im confused who killed done if hes dead i think tonkla  is that his name is the killer
what is the deal with ton kla asking for sex without using condoms am i the only one who noticed that
i loved the patience great and tyme had for each other great couldnt take his eyes off tyme so hot cant believe tyme left great hanging though during the nc scenes i wonder if the have close calls or oopsies
even i noticed tyme was the only one to finish in the nc scene great didnt didnt even pull a korn and used his hand 
i was confused for all of 10 minutes than it finally dawned on me what this episode was about the thrill of woulda coulda shoulda where everything was worst for great and being used by doc made me hurt for him even more
what the hell was going on here 
im so confused
i really liked the 1st 5 episodes but i dont like this one and i dont like tyme and his 20 seconds love scenes thats why you cant rate a show until the end
was i the only one who really liked the tymegreat love scene it was so soft and real 
hey yall can we talk about how man burried his dead cat at his college campus in the middle of cheer practice
brother i saw his ween
everyone keeps saying that but i must be missing it
im confused asf anyone else just me okay 
for instance at the end of ep 5 tyme is rushing to the hospital and in one frame hes clearly bruised and in the next hes not in ep 6 the alternate timeline great didnt help him rescue nan and so thats why he was beat up last week
its parallel universes and nonlinear storytelling great is getting glimpses of an alternate reality and so are we ep 6 is about the way things wouldve played out after the accident if great had decided to help his friend commit a murder not rescue nan etc
win thats absolutely crazy of you
wow is all i can say
ton kla is a nasty freak and may be a psycho killer
great and tymes bed scene looked like great got cheated tyme wasnt caressing or loving when he finished he was the only one satisfied 
i can believe bible is a bottom so good to see him in a different kind of role but the big question is the cat that great has is it mr gray his own cat in really life 
hahaha   awesome i was surprised  myself but you know things happen and you experiment to have a feel of how it feels on the other end
lol yeah thats his cat i heard so cute
dna lab and the fingerprints belong to mr anuwat warindej me and who in hell is that 
im assuming its ton kla
bible is so bbg in this 
these actors are dedicated
these actors are dedicated
these are some dedicated actors cause damn
sarawat is definitely hung we all got eye full
 and all im saying is lol
lmao thats what i said the man is blessed and didnt mind us knowin
1505 
you would think that detective would at least put his pants back on just in case
 hahaha     glex i definitely got it on my radar just havent started watching yet you know got too many of them going but i will start watching soon and you will definitely know  i know yall can tell cuz i go between thai taiwanese n mandarin see yah 
 i havent seen you commenting on jack and joker plzzzz tell me youre watching
 bro got traumatised too much to handle   
 the way i just cackled at kittyganglexs comment
 right like putting on a pant will be too much of a hassle  so let it fly free
lmao i just said jj why is your dk out what if you have to fight this man but he real life was crying listening to them and im sad for him
omg right
im sorry but i couldnt stop laughing at that  
great and tymes bed scene was so beautiful and passionate 
its so real and playful lol you can see theyre nervou cause its their first time and they were so goofy and comfortable with each other i love them
cant wait to get there then be on clouds series always has such complex stories and characters they will always be my favourite 1110 love this series well done
like the cats one black one white 
this was a very interesting series although i get that it was hard to follow and i think something was missed at the end my interpretation is that eps 68 were the original timeline before the first 4 minute jump back only the last scene doesnt fit with this theory
very confusing but great acting
felt sorry for korn and ton kla korn really loved him but great and tyme are my comfort zone so glad they had a happy ending excellent story writing superb acting kudos
this is one of my top bl for 2024 everything about it was fantastic korn and tonkla got me  looks like my babies got their happy ending he was saving him even though he was in his own 4 minutes i chose to believe the courts had mercy for great 
that girl is such a desperado why force someone to marry you and she knows korn likes men honey boe out gracefully you are not his type
the writing is still so poor in thai bls they have great actors that would do so much better with better written screenplay all the extended pauses with nothing to say is just bad writing
could you imagine that your brothers exlover shot you in the elevator of your own condo that is nasty work
this episode was crazy i know ill definitely watch it again
dad is a piece of shit blaming everyone except himself and his stupid wife korn needs to get himself together and stop letting his dad and step mother use him this girl is shady too and if korn marries her hell be even more miserable this show is crazy as hell just crazy
dont like this version  the doctor was so sweet and seemed to want great  this one 
so he goes from being shot and they not knowing each other
what i am watching  1848 
how is tonklas brother dead but not dead im confused lol
what is going on 
intense heart wrenching sx heavy and most of all in reverse cinematography thats whats up and im here for every seconds
aaaaahhhh so this episode is what actually happened before all the time jumps thats crazy the writer is amazing
holy mother of god this episode 6 is brilliant this is amazing storytelling god its so clever the difference between how the main character sees himself and how he actually is reality is perfection incredible acting on everyones part jesus christ this was amazing
i am completely lost wtf happened the last thing i know great got shot and i feel like there is a big gap
hey so going off ep 5 now what if everythibg we saw was great relivibg his 4 minutes ans we essentially saw all timelines and now we will see tymes 4 minutes for the last episodes idk
they cant go one bl without a damn guitar scene
well it was definitely worth the wait what an amazing dramaa fresh script no doovers here  brilliant actors and high quality a drama for those who are experiencing life after all the teenage angst congratulations  on a brilliant show x
i love it the plot is so refreshing for bl
i love this series i love the fact that they show everything cant wait for number 6 having to wait until friday to see a new episode is a bit much couldnt you shorten the time thanks for listening
im so confused with the story but love bible so will keep on watching lol
i thought it was just me lol
this show is very confusing
korn didnt even wait to hear the full details of her dad can help before he agreed to abandon tonkla and marry her for someone who is being trained to be in charge of a major crime operation hes far too easy to manipulate
im soooo lost whos alive and who is not with us anymore
okay wait im loving this series yet im terribly confused rn n sad if great or thyme diesis this a parallel type universe where its centered around 4 minutes in the 1st episode it shows thyme being shot now great is shot n his mother dies while holding him is dome
im thinking in episode one the person whos heart stopped at 11 oclock was greats and now hes in this limbo area that weird gallery area where that woman lukwa was in with him question is which version of reality will become the real version 1
 only he sees goes up by 1 minutes first day he kept seeing 1100 then 1101 and it kept counting down last we seen it was on 1103 were almost at the end hopefully he doesnt die and everything in the new tl will work itself out
 great gets shot in both tls the very first scene of episode 1 where the patients heart stopped was greats i do believe his heart stopped at 11 and now were experiencing his heart stop phenomenon my theory is he gets 4 days to experience this because each day the clock
 i think the first timeline is real which leads to the question what happened to great why is he unconscious in a coma or dying we know from episode one that dr tyme gets shot what happens next 
 in the new tl everyone is saved he meets tyme parents get busted but he gets shot also since dome doesnt die tonkla and win wouldnt meet and tonkla wouldnt kill title for revengeidk which tl i want lol i want everyone to meet and be safe and happy lol
in the og tl great doesnt save anyone and also doesnt get shot my the hitman the woman hired cause she wouldve died in the tunnel he also wouldnt meet tyme also in the og tl tonkla and win would meet because dome wouldve died still
i love this series so much so far all the plot twists and unanswered questions i love jaw dropping moments this whole concept is incredible great is in his 4 minutes of cardiac arrest and with each minute on the clock i finally realized what was happening 1010 so far
exactly as dr tyme is dying at that same moment what a parallel connection
excellent series
i am over the moon excited that this series was brought to iqiyi thank you so much
thank you viu for allowing airing on international streaming services 
l find korn is a selfish loverhe doesnt really listen to his partnerwhen tonkla talk to him he ignore what he sayshonestly l think win is a better guy for tonkla but then we all know that kla loves korn
both korn and win have used tonklas vulnerability to their advantage korn when tonkla is experiencing violence at home and win when tonkla is grieving his brother
beyond grateful they hear us out and yall did toi summited the form and asked for this series to be brought here cant believe it worked 
how do we go about doing this there is another series that would play extremely well on this steaming server
thank you for putting this on the air it is really interesting storyline is different cant wait till the next episode to see if everybodys actually dead and just remembering back
yall im still confused if dome is dead or not wtf 
i think theres some kind of parallel universe thing going on
i agree im so confused on that but i think everything that has happened with great is all within the 4 minutes of cardiac arrest he is in like its all in his head like hes thinking about how things could have been different in his life butttt im not 100 on that theory
it depends on which version of events you think are real the first set or the reset
why am i laughing im shocked i love this  they are so dedicated ive never seen a more uncensored drama
im joking with my friends going like no no no its forced perspective like lotr theyre not even in like the same room 
anybody else wildly surprised with just how uncensored this version is im still gonna watch but everytime a new nc scene comes on im taken aback
i dont have enough brain smarts for this
thank you boc for such an excellent quality well produced series and thank you to iqiyi available to international viewers everything about this series is first class interesting characters amazing actors dark twisty mystery action emotional good budgettop notch
 same a week is too long to wait omg
what a beautiful summation of the series im highly captivated and cant wait already for episode 6 this is definitely a series on all levels and im here for it
im a little confused but still happy to see this on iqiyi hard to see bible playing a meeker character cause hes such a charismatic actor
yay i get to finally watch this shocked the actually showed jj frontal nude shot what a mind twister this show is im still lost with so many questions but i love it
 episode 4 when tonkla tells win to hide because korn is here once korn leaves win come out around the corner and you can see it swing i saw people say on ig they saw and once it came available on here i had to see lol
where what episode
the pant drop the checking of the packagethe eye to eyethat smile love it 
im loving this
so great is actually dead or in limbo huh
i think hes unconscious in a coma
so happy we are here but way too many unanswered questions still
yes like dome im confused but i think he is actually dead its just in greats mind that he thinks he saved him but great is not actually with us he is in a coma i think  tonkla seems to be hallucinating because he misses dome but idk 
boc never miss
yaaaaaayyyyyyy finally its on iqiyi
what a way to end an episode
omg yay were on iqiyi now
at the end when jes is running and the lights are flickering we see him having a scarbruise on is nose light flickers and its not there light flickers again and the injury is back parallel worldsdifferent universes i cant wait until next friday
that makes sense omg i was so confused
 yooooo i missed that too
also hes wearing the same shirt that hes wearing in the scene from the first episode when hes been shot
omg i didnt even notice this thats why i love the comment section its like im never watching alone lol
finally its on iqiyi we cheered
so happy this is on iqiyi now when they said this is like an international production they werent kidding the techniques used here are super unique and not seen in thailand that often if ever this production is very well done 
thank you for airing this master piecei see you using the song from kinnporsche and its illegal p
i love bible he is beautiful and hansome and sexy hes the man
 every time the camera dipped baby so did my focus caught me unsuspecting in episode 4 wasnt going to let you do it again and then they did anyways  got a good bite didnt he   apologies to the actors i dont mean to sexualize im just appreciative
didnt get it love bible thoi read a reviewsummary n it was a whole different storygreat n tyme find ea other in 3 lifetimes great found redemption n turned himself inanyway i watched bc of bible
loved this episode it was great to see how things played out in the original timeline finally one thing to say about boc is they really are great at giving dynamic original plots love that they got sammon as screenwriter who did an amazing job with manner of death and triage
i think this should have been more episodes as it didnt make sense the story needed more time to be told the actors did well with what they were given
i dont get this i understand the concept but this makes no sense at all to me i cant get with bible being a bottom either he ia a top
i was thinking the same thing but i think they want to show a different perspective of him as an actor since vegas was so intense and aggressivethis portrait a gentle angle of him but its undeniable that his personality is way to strong to be a submissive
literally just said i dont like that they made him bottom cause he doesnt give bottom at all
i loved it but i didnt understand anything wtf happened in the last 3 eps can someone explain
i cant believe its over this was so original and like set the bar wayyyy higher for bls in the future the main visuals like jes and bible plssssssss let me breathe and the chemistry i need more asap
his fruit basket was swinging for everyone to see 
with its twists turns temporal distortions  thrills this series has elevated the genre into something smart  exciting brave  new this is only possible when you have brilliant writers directors  crew working with a talented cast led here by bible  jes outstanding
full of suspense turns temporal twists  thrills this brill series will keep you guessing  it truly lifts the genre into a whole new league of its own with incredible writing directing production  the talented cast led by the fab bible  jes perfect from start to finish
its was good but im confused lol
oh wow i enjoyed this story the spin on this story was almost dizzy how it was put together with all the different versions was just mind blowing i enjoyed watching great in this series playing a totally different role he totally made it look good
love that the series still shows that even if great did the right thing whatever is destined to happen to him will happen he still was shot even after doing the right thing in all 3 situations cant wait for the finale
guys i get it now i think this is what really happened and what we originally saw was an alternate reality in witch he had a chance to change the outcome cause in this all the people he had a chance to save before die
 but his life flashing before his eyes in which he has a chance to change the outcome of his reality but its really just all in his mind i know i probably just made it more confusing but thats what i was thinking
spoiler alert plus he was shot in the elevator in episode 1 when he steps in the elevator is when all this start you know the seeing the future thing so maybe what he is seeing is a replay of events hes already lived because he stuck in those 4 minutes and not the future
scary to see the quite character ending up being the kill3rlt never crossed my mind that it could be tonkla
theyve known each other since they were kids  for me this is one of the best bl of 2024 jes and bible are incredible actors i knew tonkla had trauma but dang
now im kinda confusedwhich versions is the actual truth or storylinecuz to me the other storyline makes more sense to me or am i wrong
im so confused as to what is going on someone feel free to explain im only watching to see bible
wheres the english subs
i definitely need to rewatch this bcs this whole time i thought warit and greats dad was the same guy i was literally wondering how he could be so different with tyme lmfao its cuz theyre different people
not fourhubxxx 
spoiler alert who was the one to shoot great in the elevator at end of ep 6 also who was the guy in blue shirt at ep 1 opening the one shot or stabbed and dying
tonkla shot great in the elevator and tyme was shot in episode 1
the guy at the end of ep 6 was tonkla domes brother who is with korn and win
is pops mad because great is gay is that what he meant when he said how can you be like this i guess he doesnt know that his other son is too or is he referring to being fiimed and it being leaked
i can totally agree with everyone its really confusing but i really love this series its the best one so far
now did he really in real life but his butt i mean like his lips were literally in his butt in talk life
i think this is the real sequence of events and its as hes dying in the elevator that hes reliving his key moments and experimenting with what would have been different if he had saved those people instead
i totally agree with you this could be the real sequence if great didnt have his gift they are still some holes thou
 the pain in his chest in the elevator the first time it happened in ep 1 i think this episode is real and the first 5 are what is in his mind during four minutes of brain death
and the count up from 1100 to 1104 in the previous episodes is showing the 4 minutes elapsing in the elevator
i dont like this tbh theyre trying to be unique which it is but its not entertaining  now were watching the whole thing again to see what would have happened but i just want the story to progress it takes so long to get through one scene theres hardly any dialogue
i want dome alive tbh 
so this is how the story wouldve gone if he didnt change his premonitionsthis episode was just mind blowing
are there anymore episodes
yes there are 2 more
nahi think my 4 minutes time is up no more for me  im done  dont like this version of events
for anyone confused by the plot rewatch eps 15 with special attention paid to thymes doctor friend researching near death experiences theres a lot of subtlety in the way details emerge that requires following along closely thats my advice
 viewers shouldnt have to watch multiple times to understand what is happening i think its poorly executed which sucks because i wanted to bible
ive done exactly this things make more sense to me now
i am so confused but i am happy to watch tyne a n great gettting together
its so refreshing to have a bl series that makes you try to figure out whats going on along with the characters the acting is great cinematography is great the nc scenes are wow and im so glad it was picked up by iqiyi so i can watch it every week
they level went up by 1000 plot too lol not mad at all engaged 1000
wtf so this is what happens if great did not see the future what will happen in the next episodeaaah another week cannot wait
so is this what would have happened if great did not see 4min ahead of time 
tyme calling great a coward for not taking action to save nan when he literally took action to save his sorry ass no lie when they say anger can blind you great what are you doing sitting on the ground in your cream colored pants there arent really 2 different storylines
this time around he only approached great to use him against his dad i felt bad for him when tyme rejected to hook up after thinking he really wanted him before even ignored the clip issue poor guy he has bigger issues like the woman dome and nans deaths
did tonkla kill title since hes the one who technically killed dome
yes in the previous episode tonkla says to win that he knows that theyll be no justice for his brothers death
yes titles family are rich  powerful and its very unlikely that he would have been arrested for what he did
yes
just confusing story line with a lot of sex
you just dont get it esther and thats okay 
not that hard to understand maybe ur just slow
wtf in the best way i think i know whats going on but im not sure now 
one thing i would this serie w t f 
i just love bible and that sex scene was smoking hot  but wth theres only 2 more ep left right 
 that is some workshop to get to this level of closeness what do they wear to cover the package or nothing i need to know these details
 i died laughing at cheeks in the mouth but true
 haha yes for me it wasaaaaaaaah loved it 
 yes but what really took me out was that great got up to shower after that what did he smell like before when the cheeks were in the mouth 
its the ass bite for me i literally screamed 
okkk now i know whats going on 
 thank you
 thanks for explaining love this
 so ep 6 tells you when he cant see the future thats how the story is gonna be and ep 5 is when he can see the future and helps the lady from being killed but in the process of helping that lady him and his mom die and ep 6 him his mother and his brother die
basically whats happening is the story has two sides one where he can see the future and prevent it from happening and the other being where he cant see the future and he cant prevent it from happening
tonkla is an important character he is so much more than korns secret partner we now know that he has taken action to get revenge on the two people responsible for his brothers murder i want to know what was on the usb that he created in episode one
 yes title  great throwing dome in the river was captured by the dash camera in titles car
 yes could he be a hacker
title car recorded the murder in this episode
this is the part of the storyline where great doesnt have the ability to see four minutes into the future this is how everything would have panned out had he not been able to see those things ahead of time and fix them
this series vexes me every week as im even more confused now it shed some light but still lacks cohesiveness
this episode was bomb cant wait to see what happens nextit was nice to see the other timeline where great doesnt have his power and tyme still denying his feelings for great lol
great was trying his best to get tymes attention after their night together but kept getting rejected
episode 6 had my brain hurting
to me it all adds up the first set of events we saw was just great trying to reverse his mistakes while his brain has the extra time after his heart stopped nothing he saw in that space affected real life
so this episode tells us what happens if great could not see 4 minutes in the future
 yes i understand how you feel i think its a feeling as if he is making things up to accept his past mistakes because he is left alone with no one to love him and no one he can love do you think win takes tonkla down for going rogue
 so i guess epi 6 is his present time without the changes in 15 so it would look like in 15 hes seeing the future but its actually his past
yeah but i dont think he can see 4 minutes in the future i think its all the choices he wouldve made differently in his past so epi 15 seems like its 4min in the future but epi 6 shows that all the stuff he seen in 15 is his past that he wishes he can change i think
so great is just gonna get killed in every scenariotimelime huh 
well he is in the middle of it all whether he participated in or is just is at fault by association he isnt truly that innocent he knows daddys not a good guy but turns a blind eye i think he winds up being in the psyche ward imagining things were different
ok so this is the og tl with no 4 minuteseven though great still gets shot i prefer the new tl hopefully great is saved in the hospital since dome didnt doe tonkla is still waiting on korn to come home when the business goes up in flames korn will go to that women and
shell tell him to leave tonkla and marry her he will do it because hes weak tonkla will cry and mourn the loss of his first love hell eventually meet win at a grocery store and everyone will live happily ever afterorwait so whats gonna happen with tyme cant wait
she will tell korn to leave tonkla and marry her he will cause hes weak tonkla will cry and eventually meet win at the grocery store and everyone will live happily ever after
and here comes the toxic part of the series
 definitely confusing and a wild roller coaster ride
yupeffing hate it now i dont want to watch any more because of how confused and angry it has me
im confused on the story line
this episode is what really happened and the previous episodes show what great wishes he had done great didnt save dome or nan he has feeling for tyme  he has been shot and is either unconscious in a coma or dying
 i hope they dont kill off bibles character great because there is two episodes left and be pointless to finish watching if hes killed off if this is the future time
theres two timelines one shows when great can see future there fore able to change it and this one shows unchanged the future that would be if great couldnt see 4 minutes in future
wow was not expecting that episode  i am just loving this series even more  cant wait for next week 
maybe they will pull a squid game and the grandma is secretly the mastermind behind the whole gambling ring
that was epic thinking this series is just like dff it keeps you on your toes
im early i didnt think id be the first to watch  comment
bro what was the point of that why are we backtracking and changing the entire story i am so confused i dont even know whats going on im just here for jessbible
this is the real chain of events the previous episodes great are replaying key events in his mind and attempting to change the outcome great is either in a coma or unconscious he has feelings for tyme which could explain why tyme is a constant feature
look at my comment
theres two timelines one shows when great can see future there fore able to change it and this one unchanged the future that would be if great couldnt see 4 minutes in the future
its not backtracking per se its showing the real timeline that wasnt caused by greats lifeflashingbeforeeyes before death in which he changes his mind and does what he whished he had the first time
bible is something else such a great actorgreater than his name heresup dad he got in his dad last nerve always  seems that he never get along with any dad 
well color me confused what did i just watch i know it was technically ep 6 but huh
 from what weve been shown i think this episode is what actually happened the seeing the future in ep 1 to 5 is great reliving the events he wishes he could have done differently i imagine he does this during his 4 minutes without oxygen after being shot
 but the premise of the show was that great could see into the future why an entire episode when he cant it seems like an odd editorial choice and just an excuse for more nc scenes it feels like they ran out of material for the original story and inserted some fan fiction
theres two timelines one shows when great can see future there fore able to change it and this one unchangedthe future that would be if great couldnt see 4 minutes in the future
well fudge a whole new look at things however pretty much the same gotta think about this in the next episode which will probably provide more incite great might actually be in the psyche ward after all 
honestly its a problem the way this series has me counting down minutes until it airs that its been hours since i watched it and i keep coming back it is a problem  and im happy to have it i love this series 
oh wow this is getting juicier and juicer
nice to see what would happen if he didnt have the chance to go back 4 minutes great episode
i am so confused
oh come on
so this is what really took placewithout going back 4 minutes
the scream i just scrummed they are building a storyline and im here for it
i feel like this is the real time line and great was trying to correct his psst hes probably already dead or close to dying that tymegreat scene 
i didnt understand episode 6 at all
episode 6 is what really happened the present and episode 15 is what choices great wish he wouldve made in the past so 15 is technically his past based off of epi 6 im guessing epi 6 is the beginning and then 15 follows after he gets shot
so just saying this cause i think is what happened but this followed all the things he prevented from happening right im kinda confused right now
at the end of the previous episode the viewer learnt what happens to the human brain when a persons heart stops one thing mentioned was revisiting past events in their mind to change the outcome is great really able to see  change the future or is something else happening
the duality of bible cannot be overstated this man went from baby boy prior episodes to beast on this one like the demeanor change is  i love this man
i agree   bible has an aura about him and his presence  his work ethic skill and duality as an actor in this 4 minutes is spectacular phenomenal 
such a great series 
it didnt make sense at first but more into it im like  i guess this what would happen if great didnt have the ability to see 4 minutes in the future
im confused with this episode 
wow
what just happened
am i the only one thats confused and dont know whats going on
so hes batman lol
so this is the alternative  time line hopefully it goes back to the other time line
there is no alternate timeline what we have been watching was greats mind in those 4 minutes on the brink of life and death replaying the events in his mind going over everything that has happened and playing out what mightve happened if he chose different
this series is trippy af i love it 
what the omg did not see this episode coming now 7 days of waiting for next episode    
this series keeps getting better with each episode next friday seems too far away i need to know what happens next
the acting is so well done i think this is the real time line what is korn going to do when he finds out tonkla shot his brother
this series just gets better and better with every episode 
and here i thought the reverse psychology would be my own doing 
amazing series plot acting setting photography all connected perfectly my favorite bl since i started watching series in 2014
im so confused 
thanks for adding the full line up its always good to see these handsome n talented actors 1234 he had killed once he would do 2nd do 3rd
what a ride i watched with a friend because it was too stressful to watch alone we helped each other follow the plot i really like that every character was morally grey my theory is everyones dead at the end or as my friend put it theyre all in dead land
oopsi didnt c last 2 episodessorry for my previous post
wow so powerfully sexy i was confused at episodes 6 and 7 but it all became clear at episode 8 it was flasback and extra thoughts thank you for showing and for the beautiful translation x
korn tried soo hard to hold on to everything
ended up not watching it for the plot but for bible
he should have uploaded the clip and if anything happens it would be released automatically to the internet
is everyone stupid in this show cops are corrupt he should have made multiple copys of the video clip just in case 
amazing story wonderful actors well executed the people who are talking sht about the series havent really seen a good series with an amazing plot a lot of ncs wont make a series good everything was well balanced in this
couldnt agree more top tier television with excellent plot too many people are used to the same old college bl being recycled to them again and again loved this show
this is crazy whoever rated this as a romance must have been high this is a thriller
i mean they knew it was a mind fuck and probably thought that was close enough 
i agree its definitely a thriller with a splash of romance i love it lol
a very intelligent  thoughtprovoking drama which i enjoyed
love this series  bingewatching
petition to give fuiaz a happy ending just once tt
child great is also child san from century of love yes
i paid no attention lol ill rewatch and come bk like this commenr so i can find you
the plot of the story  grippingintriguing the twist and turns  the directors and screen writers were amazing series the all stars cast were amazing i hope we get to see more of this type of movie 
also this is now 2 series that poor fuaiz was killed by jj  can we get at least 1 happy ending for those two holy moly
excuse me but is this a cover of why dont you stay from kinnporsche 
1 the song at the end im dying 2 these males have got to stop getting shotdying 3 take the damn money
confused the shit out of me at first i think this could have been better not as great as i would have liked it to be
i was confused for about 4 episodes but lovely end for these two
wow what a final absolutely fantastic thank you beyond cloud
this series started out so good  and theonn it took a turn into chaos and confusion  i am so disappointed 
well crafted intruiging story beautiful cinematography breathtaking acting its perfect and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time 
i made it that was a ride and wow what a packed last eps that end song of jeff saturs why dont you stay    perfection
watched last episode and have read everyones comments will now go back and rewatch the whole series with a clearer understanding plot and actors far superior to any bl series that i have watched this year
omg the same song that song
ahhh 6 minutes until the last episode
im really enjoying this show but i cant believe they can wrap it up in one more episode theres so much going on
yesss its friday at 1120am the last episode ive waited all week but hopefully itll be a season 2 thatll be awesome 
i hope the last episode can deliver
how many times did i roll my eyes too many too many
im perplexed with everyones confusion haha we even have dr det explicitly explaining the plot in one of the episodes this show is masterfully made cast and crew outdid themselves absolutely breathtaking it has had me in a chokehold since ep1 waiting for the last ep 
grandma   put it back or keep it  me  of course im gonna keep it what are you talking about grandma
im so confusedlol but ima keep watchingmaybe this might become a series with many seasons
i think everyone watching this is completely confused i know i am and theres one more crazy episode left
confusing
the producers are confusing  everyone and cutting and joining story lines and making it complicated randomly storylines are not catching or interesting  i dont know why bible agreed on this storyline series 
this happens when you only watch for the steamy scenes i can tell you have never watched a psychological movie this is actually one of the best in this movie category you should keep watching your school puppy love bls and leave this to those who appreciate wellmade content
wow so very confused so is the person ton kla killed in an earlier episode actually him killing title but the storylines are all in random order and where did the 4 minutes go are the 4 minutes memories the dying great is reliving so he has a chance to choose better
 ok because i was confused
yes ton kla killed title then tries to kill great the 4 minutes from my understanding has always been before death what we saw before were theories like what would have happened if great made different decisions
tho even the better choices lead him to the same point so im not sure what the lesson is except his death is someone elses fault rather than his own crazy crazy storyboard
i think you ppl think of this as a continuous story and not just one episode at a time itll make more sense we are seeing all of the characters reality vs 4 minutes to fix it im hopeful for the last episode and love this series
i do think the last episode will tie everything together its just a lot to pull into one episode maybe they will make it longer i think the confusion lies in the fact we get a detail that coincides wthe next and since we have to wait every week everyone theorizes
ugh one more episode left im tired of these short series i want more
i knew he didnt kill that cat
it looks as there can be no happy endings for any of the characters korn has been left to pick up the pieces by his dad great  tyme might not survive grandma has been shot and tonkla has seen too much sadness  ended too many lives to be happy friday is too far away
the compression of the story so far into only 7 episodes really lifts the viewers angst and expectations for episode 8 to new levels im sitting on the precipice of loving this series or not  the whole cast have been amazing so no pressure 4 minutes writers 
ive been surprised by the quality of this series most of the thai productions ive seen have pretty amateurish dialog
i had high hopes for this series it started out great but now it is dumb there are too many stories going at the same time and what happened to greats 4 minutes
 looks like the main character role should of been fuaiz right he is phenomenal imho havent seen the entire ep but i had to share before i forgot
tonkla and domes dad kinda had it coming to him imo i love the series but i wish this series was longer they could have done much more
personally they could have ended it with the scene in the hospital with tyme holding greats hand and apologizing i probably wont look at the last episode the only ending that would work for me is if they were both actually dead and they walk into the light holding hands
 rely on all the spoilers for final closure
ng handthe only other scenario that would make me smile is if all of what we have seen has taken place in four minutes and great actually survives with tyme at his bedside holding his hand the joke would be on us  of course neither scenario is going to occur so i will happily
i love how this show just showed us how each character arrived at their path of destruction and their regrets i am hoping episode 8 gives me a somewhat happy ending i need them to come out of this ok and recovering 
omg they are linked omg episode 8 cant come soon enough
fuaiz is putting on a show of acting this actor is so young and promising
i dont understand why this series is only 8 ep i hope the final episode isnt rushed next week
i actually dont know what im watching anymore lol ive seen so many scenarios  im just going with it atp
im so confused so did he dream about he and his grandma getting shot 
his grandma was shot when tyme was shot his 4 minutes starts and in his mind he is going back to the diary reading the diary is what started his plans for revenge
curious to know if anyone else thinks this series was rushed like they could have made it longer than 8 episodes theres just a lot of detail thats missing imo
 sorry maybe second or third episode
 except dome wasnt his brother and didnt die great rescued dome in the first episode
 yeah i cant remember which episode but he finds title and kills him with a rock like he did dome then previous he finds great and shoots him which we know now even tho he knows itll affect korn he still did it anyway
 i do like the series and think i will have to give it a second watch once i have that last episode to truly tie it all together but having all these short clips here and there riddles like you said got me  but longer series would have been great even more detailed etc
 he did remember the bloody rock it was from ton kla the actual scene will probably be shown next week thats why he went after great because he saw the video of them both great was shot because he is seen helping dump domes body
 tonkla  domes brother killed title then shot great
i really dont see how they can wrap all of this in one episode why didnt domes brother go after titlehe is the one that killed his brother
i dont feel that way however i could support a longer series its that good i find this labyrinth very intriguing like riddles i hate to try and figure out but cant avoid doing so hopefully it can lead to a second season or several spinoffs ie titles upbringing
totally agree
the cat
this series is so freaking good last episode it was reality from greats perspective and this one is reality for tonkla and the why for episode 6 and can we talk about how fuaiz is killing it with his acting 
fuaiz is without a doubt the star of this series his portrayal of tonkla is an outstanding performance
totally agree
now tyme gets 4 minutes they just added a whole nother scenario if he chooses to keep the diary then the events happen as is if he puts it back nothing changes as far as his own tl great still has a crappy friend like title to pull him into bs
why granny kept the diary is beyond me she knew her child fudged up and kept the evidence for what is granny the wicketkeeper if tyme didnt keep the diary all this wouldnt have unfolded if he did when did the 4 mins begin 
gosh the connection between tyme and great is deep i cant wait for episode 8 
 awesome thank you so happy we can connect again herei miss our standin you knowi stopped by every so often just to read comments  so true on your take on this onewhen i read your comment the other day i was like thats like youhope epi 8 wont disappoint n s2 soon
 its a pleasure to read yours as wellim happy to see my standin alumni herethe cast here is amazing but too the story gets condensed for mefamily of 10 in a one bedroom apartment kind of 
 hold up tiger  were you reading my thoughts just now just kidding  always nice to read what youre thinking seriously i agree with your input i wish this was more than an 8 episodes watch but know this rolls im all about n all in on s2 you know 
its like magnets but i think the plot its a little too much for 8 ep id say the production got too ambitiousseems like squeezing one semester of school in one weekthen everything turns all over the placehope that they have a second season to untangle everything
so many psychopaths in this series 
 muchsimas gracias  ah s lo recuerdo i agree totally if this is easily solved then it will just confirm how rushed everything was done because of time crunch im like you i like to see the whole nine yard maybe in season 2  just excited n awaiting episode 8
 eres super te acuerdas de mis gustos  im looking forward to the final episode to see how distorted things really are i will be totally disappointed if all is solved so easily its so good its gotta end just as good or better even with some senseless input
 i know you are super enthusiastic as it is kinda around what you enjoy watching i mean the writers did amazing with this one  forcing one to see think outside the box you know i would even say mind psychic hope win solves the case but remember he almost died trying 
 agree its intensely satisfying for some reason  the evil that lingers is so controlling glad many of us are enjoying such ominous series together i like you think our dear inspector win dies or will he finally reach justice by taking chief and his crew down
 thats right no i have not but im thinking i should
so truetypical be on clouddid you see dead friends forever
 hola mi amiga i believe so too his character is so deep n dark but hes the product of all hes experienced n its effects yes it will be nice if he makes it at the end n finds true love you know the psychological impact of this series is like none before it n im intrigued
 totally agreed it is a great series with lots twists n turns n mind psychyou know thiss probably the first time ive paid attention to the opening ost n im like it definitely foreshadowsforebodes something ominous n weve seen that n then someyes to a second season 
thus far the only sane person i see is ton kla he is the only 1 who sees how shee t life is and if you want it fixed you on your own im curious to know what will happen to him i hope he escapes and finds a person who will love him for real we shall see salut mon ami
lots of twists and turns i agree tho ep 7 seemed rushed  too many senerios still a great series
i look forward to fridays with 4minutes  such an interesting premise and the actors are all amazing a hug for everyone from the uk 
i cant believe he did thattt
i cantlike i really can not right now the way they keep us guessing is out of this world
theyve known each other since they were kids grandma they died at the same time   know it probably wont happen but can they save each other or be together in the after life jes and bible are incredible actors for me this is one of the best bl of 2024
now we know why tyme apologizes his parents started it all and he continued to mess with the order of things causing more heartache all for revenge i blame grandma for it she could of destroyed the evidence if she said nothing could be done apology is fitting
absolutely sets a new bar
well im a little confused
you way ahead of most of us then 
omg making sense nowi really like this series
 heres what i think great has already been shot at the beginning of ep 1 ep 15 is an unconscious great trying to rewrite events e6 is what really happened  e7 is tymes  tonklas backstory
please explain because i dont understand 
how are they going to wrap all this up in only one more episode
probably with a cliffhanger or it will all make sense once all episodes are put together by doc den with his research and fabulous insight hell present his findings to his colleagues for some reason i cant avoid thinking of natcha she probably knew too much
speechless right now love it dont want it to end one more episode left
lmao i wondered why on episode 6 tyme told great i see your still afraid of dogsthey knew each other from childhood
i love this show but this episode got me a more confused 
okay did anyone get this episode cus im so confused 
ok if i was confused before now im 100 lost
next episode better be like 3 hours cuz no way this is wrapping up with only one more episode
every episode leaves me with more questions than answers but i still really want to know how this all ends lol
i get confused with every episode smh 
what a thriller love it
so everyone dies in itvery sad
poor bible he gets shot or dies in all the characters he plays well not sure about maam chief
soooo trippy love this
en resumen mi estimado no salvo a nadie y encima se quedo pegado en su mundo 
the more i understand the more i get confused  i cant even guess how this is all going to end
 i think youre on to something there
im gonna venture and say ton kla takes out warit and fasai then life will become peaceful again with everyone dead except korn his father and stepmother doc den lukwa and nurses ann  bee we shall see
how on earth can there be only one episode remaining and still hope to resolve this plot in any other way than both of them dead story is now at least becoming clear and while this is a fascinating series romance is not what i would ever label it
i mean its a mind fuck they probably thought that was close enough 
agreed
so true
agree
yep
this is the only series that is going to drive me to drink aiyeee faints 
ahhhh omg so many questions were answered but i need more 
i watched this twice and it made more sense after the second time it really is a masterpiece and boc are becoming a force in quality productions it really is a phenomenal show and we are getting a follow up called 8 hours i heard so cant wait for that thank you to all
cant wait for sequel titled 8 hours coming soon loved it 1010
im really sad at the people all dying either in dreams or real time bible did a great acting job but as always it was cutcensored
unbelievable stunning cinematography storyline and character development was outstanding loved every minute of it and would highly recommend
ikyflthis ending about to make me break something
loved it and the ending omg  just like superb dead friend forever the ending was left to your own opinion i guess be on cloud have excellent bl
watched all episodes twice still confused
this is why i wait and binge shows i wish i could give a detailed explanation of the story line as i understood it and point things out but they dont let you write that much this isnt the same old wash and repeat its a masterpiece a little rushed but still 
korn and ton kla were doomed from the start  they couldnt get it together in any time line so very sad poor ton kla had some serious ptsd and terrible coping mechanisms
5515 oh man  its like deception dream inside a dream
3200 oh sugar  everybody died
the kinnporche ost is really throwing me 
gave up trying to figure it out time line was awful but everything else was ok seeing bible so gentle and calm liked jes with him they make great costars hope to see them all again soon jeffs song at the end gold
oki posted at ep 6 n stated i was confused i thought it only had 6well watched all 8 n still confusedlove bible tho
i got really lost i couldnt tell what past and present
i am so utterly confused
i am so utterly confused
so confused with that series
compelling and interesting up to episode 5 then everything goes haywire great loses his 4 minute power and we have a rerun of the whole story showing the worst outcomes without any explanation why  weird the sex scenes for once were the most accurate and genuine
why wont my view be allowed to enter 
im so confused about episode six
absolutely fantastic show best time travel parallel universe ive watched
wow that was a seriously twisted story i loved it really well done and nice having a mature story that still comes across as bl kudos to everyone involved
oh im speechless this was so much better than i anticipated the story  concept were executed beautifully  1010 seriously  im so mad its over but so happy it happened and i got to watch it
wow just wow 
a master reality of decisions this should teach us to think very well before acting we dont have turning backs great actors hope to seeing the again soon
the story had some abrupt segue ways but i didnt hate it i honestly wasnt sure how this was going to end and thats pretty rare for me  i do hope we start seeing more bl like this
the ending song being a song that was used in kp made me want to cry because this is now the second time i have had to see bible die and come back amazing series and an amazing actor multiple amazing actors but i will love bible forever
missed you bible 
if i have to give this series a thesis title it would be the interdependency correlation and dichotomy between fate and the consequences of our decisions on realityits a bl like no otherthe actors deserve all their flowers all the way 
i want to see more shows like this that dont compromise having a fully fleshed storyline with amazing twists and turns for the sake of a beautiful love story too 4 minutes is proof you can have both
i really enjoyed this series its great to watch a bl that puts so much work into creating an intricate and interesting storyline if theres anything you can take away from this show its that there is always another choice to make whether it be hard or easy it is there
pt 14 last update thanks for reading all of my comments i just had to get it off my chest because it was also very confusing and i didnt understand till the next morning overall very cool storyline but i wish things went better
pt 13 it makes us upset that it didnt end up like the first 2 episodes great didnt mean to hurt or get anybody killed but he also didnt do anything about it when he saw it happening but i can understand how he could have felt helpless
i think youre missing the point of the drama he has no such thing as powers  his 4 minutes were simply him reliving life  removing his regrets in the 4 minutes before becoming brain dead having a superpower doesnt make u great redeeming yourself does  taking accountability
pt 11 boyfriend couldnt be together maybe they could have their own 4 minutes usually in dramas it shows you how the main character made all the bad choices and then dies and then able to go back in time and make the right choices but this one did the opposite and it kind of
pt 11 i like that the 2 of them are together but i dont get how time could be okay with great stopping his parents from coming back to thailand because they killed a lot of people they should go to prison im sad that dome didnt get to live and grates brother and his 
pt 10 dome died and grates brothers boyfriend got his revenge and really did die with him as they got shot and thats where you see time and great grief for their loved ones grandma is dead brother and brothers boyfriend dead parents are on the run out of thailand
pt 9 upon his revenge and thats where you see him have all these happy lovey moments with great but then when he comes back you start to see that the beginning of the 2 episodes didnt really happen it was just an altar universe of what could have happened but really
pt 8 relationship and in the backstory his grandma did get killed by the guys of greats family and he did get shot and as his friend was trying to save him and bring him back time didnt get 4 minutes like he did he just lived in a different universe where he never acted
pt 7 so in the real reality he is in the hospital recovering from being shot from the elevator and time didnt want a relationship with him he was just using him to get back at his dad even though gray didnt care wanted to have a
pt 6 thats where it started his powers so he really got shot in the elevator and died and thats when he got the powers and went back in time but the first time when he made all the right choices he got shot saving his mom so in the real reality hes in the hospital now
pt 5 and dome actually died the real reality is great hit that woman help his friend kill dome though he didnt actually kill him he let happen and nan died in and he never saved her and that guy that his brother was in love with did shoot him in the elevator addis condo
pt 4 and youre able to go back and change the things that you couldnt before and then we get into the episodes where i dont like it but basically in the beginning great his choices that were good he never made those choices he made the wrong choices in every situation
pt 3 and then in the next couple of episodes you see the conversation and talk that the lady is saying during the art gallery about when your heart stops your brain can survive for 4 minutes and when that happens sometimes you can receive superpowers like seeing the future
pt 2 choice and saving the people who were going to get hurt and it all starts with time giving him that tai tea in the message was go heal your wounds but then theres like a flash where it said im sorry great
okay this is how i understood the storyline i didnt like it but it was also different and very interesting so in the first 2 episodes you see great and as he goes through different situation where you might think he might choose the bad choice he ends up making a better 1
bas and fuaizwas freaking amazing in this series bible and jes were great also but the second couple was what kept me interested in this series
all i want to know is who is the female that granted the 4 minutes at the art exhibition who is this person this is like william faulkners the sound and the furyfreaky nonlinear story telling once youre aware of it and lucid keyword lucid this show starts to make
 sense spoiler  great hits someone his friend makes him accessory to a murder after the fact and his brothers lover the victim family member finds out he took part in the crime and shots him the start of greats 4 minutes ie episode 1
 all of this is explained in ep 56 thyme  on his revenge mission gets it wrong and as is literally coding in the hospital he is being gunned downed in the rain and his 4 minutes startswhich runs pretty fast because he no longer wants revenge and has lots of happy
time with great reality brother rats out fake girlfriends father before he goes on the run with his lover does not end well great  thyme end up together even though we have no clue if he will go to jail or be on probation nonlinearconfusing story w holes bible was great
i feel so bad for the brothers who lived a horrible life because of their father and both ended up getting murdered they deserved better
i dont even know what to say it was amazing and showed a completely different kind of story than any other bl it was trippy and confusing at times which made me feel more invested and trying to figure out what was going on i loved it and everyone in it
i have no idea what happened totally confused throughout but the acting was great and the sultry scenes did not disappoint
my dumba struggled to understand what was happening but it was so gooooood
wth im so confused so eps 14 are greats 4 minutes eps5  6 are reality and ep7 are thymes 4 minutes so what is ep 8 reality again after experiencing the 4 minutes anyone help or have there own theories
am i gonna regret watching episode 8 am i gonna need tissues
this was such a good show and it caused so much emotional damage holy crap
this was really good no boring school cant even kiss show actors brilliant story interesting sex scenes omg brilliant and oh so hot give it a watch
the only constant that was good was the sexy sex scenes
very strange series few characters died came back and some died again felt sorry for the second couple that meet their end at the end
loved it best series ever
well done for multi time line story much easier to grasp if you binge great chemistry in the cast
final thoughts i feel like it was rushed bc of everything going on with boc  pond  it was either this or scrapping it i wish there were a few more episodes to get into characters  plot the actors did what they could wwhat they had fuaiz was the stand out winner of all
 there was a lot of scandals going on surrounding build who was supposed to be tyme in this series and he left boc because of those problems then pond the director and producer also had to leave because of those scandals
whats happening with boc and pond
fuaiz and bas stole this series absolutely amazing acting and chemistry 
so good already rewatched twice i wonder if that last scene of korb and tonkla talking about running away together is korns 4 minutes to fix but he couldnt cuz he died or ran out of time either way great story
how fitting that jeff sang 
actually it was jes tyme but its such a good vocal i had to double check 
i think we all experienced an unsatisfying feeling with the ending but i think that is the point those 4 minutes were just a desire to change regrets or unfinished business but it is all an illusion since you cant change reality and sadly reality can be disappointing
very confusing left feeling confused loved the 2 ml but last 2 episodes lost me shame because i loved the story up till then
refuse to read the other comments and dreading the last episode got me riding on an emotional roller coaster why you got to do me like that boc
this ended too soon i wanted more sultry inspector scenes
they are in dead friends forever 
fantastic in every way kudos to the actors
conceptually this show is awesome very abstract and a good show to get you thinking outside the box but ultimately having greats fixed mistakes actually not be fixed and having tyme be a douche in the real timeline just makes you face palm yourself super cool show tho
easily fell into confusion for the last two episodes and i still think the revelation part lacked the part where everything makes sense wasnt crispy enough it was a stretch to make it make sense still have some unanswered questions and unresolved feelings
they shouldve asked jeff to write a new one
jeff had already left the company but there are plenty of talents in the cast that could have written a new one i think this too was abandoned for time
excellent in every way the story the acting the filming bravo exceptional series 
i love bible he so dam sexy
boc never disappoints they may take us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions but its always a well told story full and rich in storytelling and character development a must watch
do we know who shot wachai
why did they have to use that song i started balling my eyes out
i got the biggest smile on my face when he started singing it it was honestly the perfect song for that moment although that song makes me cry too 
love it or hate it but the storytelling is really solid i was thinking 8 episodes would be tight to bring all the loose ends together but it was just right heres hoping this starts a trend in bl dramas focus on the main story and hire actors that can act
the best show i have seen this year incredible
acting was brilliant was beautifully filmed had no idea what was going on would still watch it again shame ton kla and korn ended that way great showed what a stellar fellow he was by keeping his parents out of thailand and keeping tyme on the straight and narrow
one of the best bl series ive seen in a long time i need to see the main couple in another bl asap
confused happy surprised and on board for the ride the acting was incredible they went all out with the production and story line wow
adding why dont you stay was a master play for this drama
i think i get the show now the first part of show is when great was already in his 4 mins after getting shot by tonkla the middle was actually the real world that lead up to great getting shot by tonkla the last part was tyme getting shot  going into his 4 mins
thank you
ton kla and korn just couldnt get it together in life i hope they did in death that scene tore me up and it sicks because just before korn pulls the trigger it flashes to lets leave lets get away im not scared anymore then to his watch full of blood and theyre both gone
yall this episode took my clean out when ton kla told korn what he did to his brother korn damn near had a nervous breakdown and was going to shoot the officer but ton got shot and korn shot himself i cried it reminded me of utwma confusing at times but it all came together
am i the only one who didnt like korn i 100 think he would have never chosen ton kla if that girl hadnt dropped him he was so selfish wasnt there for tk at all im sorry but some flashbacks and him showing up at the 11th hour isnt enough
i agree with you he obviously didnt love ton kla as much as he liked the girl
i dont get the story at all but i enjoy the suspense and chemistrythe song choice for the ost was unexpectedaaaaaaa i llve the acoustic version so much
i am on you with this it was very confusing expecially ep8 i didnt understand how they knew about the 4 min if ep7 was all about what would happen if they didnt have the 4 min i think the story could have gone better
this series was truly so good like every single detail on the story and in the scenarios beoncloud never fails to amaze me for realcannot wait for another one like this
out of all the songs they could have chose they had to choose the kinnporsches
wow  you have to put the ending song on the soundtrack i have to listen to this when im at work trying to drown out everything else
somebody call an ambulance  phone in his hand great turns around and leaves after seeing her collapse  this guy
i need another jesbble project now
the scene where ton kla tells korn everything was the stand out scene in this episode possibly the whole series bas  fuaiz were amazing at showing the emotions between korn  tom kla the pain the sadness and ultimately love the two felt  will always feel for each other
amazing absolutely beautiful but i gotta say i nearly passed the hell out when they were on the boat and they checked the time this was by far one of the best angsty series ive ever watched be on cloud please continue to spoil us 
that was one heck of a story kudos to the screenwriters and the actors who actually pulled it off so flawlessly so many corpses by the end of it but i still liked it a lot great work team
one of the best serie 2024 the cast did an amazing job 8 episode that give use a rolercaster of emotion
occasionally id get confused but at the end i understood it all amazing bl the actors amazing as well just all together beautiful
i love this series we need another one 
ton kla and korn im not sat here in a puddle of tears 
tonkla and korn completely stole the show
over all though i loved it little confusing at times but if your brain can separate the time lines it makes sense
i loved it but i seriously hate the ending i feel it needed another 4 episodes to fix ton kla and korns ending cause that sucked kinda feel it was rushed at the end with 3 alternate time lines i feel it could have tied a happier ending for all parties with 4 more episodes
i reckon by the end theyre all dead the angel wing lights the mysterious lake the song even tho we didnt hear the final line its why dont you stay so im saying they all got their happy ending in their own dead land
their actions were beyond repair if they lived they couldnt get a happy ending 
why dont you stay at the end omg 
yes that was unexpectedthe song also appeared in the middle of the episode  i really like this version
yes right omg
well that was the most confusing fantastic show i have watched for a while the acting was superb but was devastated when korn and his boy died so many things happening but have to say the pairing of bible and jes was amazing they really compliment each other 
i loved it easily one of the best of 2024 everything about this masterpiece worked tyme went to save great in his own 4 minutes i knew he loved great bas made me cry had no idea he was that good of an actor thank you jesbible and boc for this masterpiece
bas was a standout in this ep just wow
the song 
love this series one of my favorites now sad about korntonkla also wintonkla but im happy tymegreat got a happy ending santa wait to see more from be on cloud also jesbible jjfuaiz
one thing for sure i have remained confused to the end 2 things for sure sure i enjoyed it confused to the very end
same i truly dont get the story and i dont think anyone could even explain it in a way that can make me understand
this is easily one of the best bl of 2024 probably in my top ten of all time this was amazing to me tyme went to save greatbin his own 4 minutes  korn  had no idea bas was such a good actor thank you bible and jes and boc for this masterpiece
i was utterly confused
what a roller coaster ride it kept me on the edge of my seat for every episode 
very confusing
this plot confused the crap out of me but good grief was the acting fire i cant believe i cried the actor who played korn was phenomenal their ending made me think of the end scene of romeo and juliet he loved tonkla so much he couldnt live without him
i absolutely dont like the series it was way too rushed and all over the place i do however love the actors and hope they get better projects together
so real user7ec17eb0a
yay
the song at the end 
 1304 i mean no matter how serious the series is they always make time to show the sponsors somehow lol
 i dont like it or the message and i absolutely hate that you effed up pjeffs song the way you did at the end of the last ep you guys just lost a fan
i dont think it needs to be that deep
omg  are you serious 
awesome series
anyone else utterly confused great acting but i cant keep up with the pastpresentpastpresent
im glad i am not the only one it was so confusing i keep rewatching it to try to understand whats happening but its not helping much honestly its still a good show though but its very confusing
totally lost me last few episodes but loved the cast 2 ml so good
right here with you everything was so confusing after ep4 i think it could have been better
okay so its not only me
same here
we deserve a spinoff 1hr long episode of them just being happy and going on dates
this was awesome why am i emotional my gosh great job everyone keep this caliber of series cast acting coming 
boc boys are just top tier acting lord 
yes they are
i love this series i love how we have been able to see the strong influence of going down the wrong path in our choices and how it was always in us to do the right thing not wait till our life is flashing before our eyes close to death to try to change it
yo i didnt expect to here why dont you stay at the end
same i actually like this version and wonder if jes sang the song 
can someone tell me what they show wants to do cause im getting more confused the more im going to the end
i for sure cant help you  its so darn confusing
you have the real timeline where great is shot by ton kla you have greats 4 minutes while he is dying timeline you have most of tymes 4 minutes dying timeline in this ep
loved the series but i dont feel satisfied with this being the last episode totally no fault of the actorsall about the storyline
gosh i was all tearyeyed as great n tyme sailed  happily away with the intensely beautiful song  from kim n porchay love love n muaah  s2
beautiful relationship between tyme and great i mean their relationship was everything before the plus n minus in time n i enjoyed it very much win was the surprise i did see coming but i took it all in anyway
amazing fantastic   absolutely love this drama amazing job to all of production to the actors  actresses
bl of the year
wow what an impeccable cast  this show was masterfully done every actors delivery was topnotch we can see everyones dedication behind the scenes in the quality of the product truly amazing job by the whole cast and crew i hope everyones proud of what theyve created 
my ton kla korn babies  this series was brilliant though confusing at times top tier acting
anyone else confused on what happened to the alternate universe where the brother was alive
that was great regret in his four minute timeline he stopped title from killing dome  basically it wasnt real
what kind of ending is this im so confused
hahaha me too
this was mind blowing
this is def a series you need to binge or you may give up in the middle due to confusion good story once it all comes together but so disjointed along the way
jesus lord this has been one of my favorite brain scramblings ever in a series just excellent the cast and crew should take so much pride in what they were able to accomplish with this masterpiece
what an ending also i loved they used why dont you stay by jeff satur also used in kinnporsche for this drama
i love the series and everything but give me a jjfuaiz series with happy ending
its over fridays wont be the same 4 minutes has raised my expectations of bl series and im not sure what to watch next also was the music at the end from the song why dont you stay  kinnporsche soundtrack with different lyrics 
sad and happy i cried a little
ok now i need to rewatch this to see all the connections i didnt see the first time
i actually wanted this to have a sad ending but oh well in general this was an amazing series 
the best of the year wellcrafted plot kept you guessing and hoping from first to last episode the main actors jes and bible were outstanding their complicated characters and relationship kept the series alive the supporting actors and stories filled out this narrative
kinnporshe
no they didnt use the song from kimporshe
is that good or bad because i like this version of the song
8 episodes i cant see clearly what the point is whats going on i need some explain por favor
 a surgeon is always a physician but a physician is not always a surgeon
i didnt get the story either but i love the actors its all very confusing and too many loose ends for example is tyme a physician or a surgeon
now i need to go back  watch from the beginning curious why they are using music from kp
maybe because two of the characters played in kp maybe they suggested that they put that song in there because we all love it but with a different spin on the lyrics
sooooooo confused
please someone can explain to me because i dont understand anything
wait what thats not how i thought it would end they full on went nope no chance of a season 2
me hears a jeff satur song me ariana what are doing here
justicefortonkla
why am i confused
 hahahahah
i have been confused since the beginning 
real timelin tonkla shoots great dome is dead tonkla and korn are dead at the end great and tyme almost die while great and tyme are almost dying they create in their dying imagination the two other timelines shown greats for most of the series tymes mostly in ep8
dont worry youre not the only one
