1234 he had killed once he would do 2nd do 3rd
what a ride i watched with a friend because it was too stressful to watch alone we helped each other follow the plot i really like that every character was morally grey my theory is everyones dead at the end or as my friend put it theyre all in dead land
oopsi didnt c last 2 episodessorry for my previous post
wow so powerfully sexy i was confused at episodes 6 and 7 but it all became clear at episode 8 it was flasback and extra thoughts thank you for showing and for the beautiful translation x
korn tried soo hard to hold on to everything
ended up not watching it for the plot but for bible
he should have uploaded the clip and if anything happens it would be released automatically to the internet
is everyone stupid in this show cops are corrupt he should have made multiple copys of the video clip just in case 
amazing story wonderful actors well executed the people who are talking sht about the series havent really seen a good series with an amazing plot a lot of ncs wont make a series good everything was well balanced in this
couldnt agree more top tier television with excellent plot too many people are used to the same old college bl being recycled to them again and again loved this show
this is crazy whoever rated this as a romance must have been high this is a thriller
i mean they knew it was a mind fuck and probably thought that was close enough 
i agree its definitely a thriller with a splash of romance i love it lol
a very intelligent  thoughtprovoking drama which i enjoyed
love this series  bingewatching
petition to give fuiaz a happy ending just once tt
child great is also child san from century of love yes
i paid no attention lol ill rewatch and come bk like this commenr so i can find you
the plot of the story  grippingintriguing the twist and turns  the directors and screen writers were amazing series the all stars cast were amazing i hope we get to see more of this type of movie 
also this is now 2 series that poor fuaiz was killed by jj  can we get at least 1 happy ending for those two holy moly
excuse me but is this a cover of why dont you stay from kinnporsche 
1 the song at the end im dying 2 these males have got to stop getting shotdying 3 take the damn money
confused the shit out of me at first i think this could have been better not as great as i would have liked it to be
i was confused for about 4 episodes but lovely end for these two
wow what a final absolutely fantastic thank you beyond cloud
this series started out so good  and theonn it took a turn into chaos and confusion  i am so disappointed 
well crafted intruiging story beautiful cinematography breathtaking acting its perfect and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time 
i made it that was a ride and wow what a packed last eps that end song of jeff saturs why dont you stay    perfection
watched last episode and have read everyones comments will now go back and rewatch the whole series with a clearer understanding plot and actors far superior to any bl series that i have watched this year
omg the same song that song
ahhh 6 minutes until the last episode
im really enjoying this show but i cant believe they can wrap it up in one more episode theres so much going on
yesss its friday at 1120am the last episode ive waited all week but hopefully itll be a season 2 thatll be awesome 
i hope the last episode can deliver
how many times did i roll my eyes too many too many
im perplexed with everyones confusion haha we even have dr det explicitly explaining the plot in one of the episodes this show is masterfully made cast and crew outdid themselves absolutely breathtaking it has had me in a chokehold since ep1 waiting for the last ep 
grandma   put it back or keep it  me  of course im gonna keep it what are you talking about grandma
im so confusedlol but ima keep watchingmaybe this might become a series with many seasons
i think everyone watching this is completely confused i know i am and theres one more crazy episode left
confusing
the producers are confusing  everyone and cutting and joining story lines and making it complicated randomly storylines are not catching or interesting  i dont know why bible agreed on this storyline series 
this happens when you only watch for the steamy scenes i can tell you have never watched a psychological movie this is actually one of the best in this movie category you should keep watching your school puppy love bls and leave this to those who appreciate wellmade content
wow so very confused so is the person ton kla killed in an earlier episode actually him killing title but the storylines are all in random order and where did the 4 minutes go are the 4 minutes memories the dying great is reliving so he has a chance to choose better
 ok because i was confused
yes ton kla killed title then tries to kill great the 4 minutes from my understanding has always been before death what we saw before were theories like what would have happened if great made different decisions
tho even the better choices lead him to the same point so im not sure what the lesson is except his death is someone elses fault rather than his own crazy crazy storyboard
i think you ppl think of this as a continuous story and not just one episode at a time itll make more sense we are seeing all of the characters reality vs 4 minutes to fix it im hopeful for the last episode and love this series
i do think the last episode will tie everything together its just a lot to pull into one episode maybe they will make it longer i think the confusion lies in the fact we get a detail that coincides wthe next and since we have to wait every week everyone theorizes
ugh one more episode left im tired of these short series i want more
i knew he didnt kill that cat
it looks as there can be no happy endings for any of the characters korn has been left to pick up the pieces by his dad great  tyme might not survive grandma has been shot and tonkla has seen too much sadness  ended too many lives to be happy friday is too far away
the compression of the story so far into only 7 episodes really lifts the viewers angst and expectations for episode 8 to new levels im sitting on the precipice of loving this series or not  the whole cast have been amazing so no pressure 4 minutes writers 
ive been surprised by the quality of this series most of the thai productions ive seen have pretty amateurish dialog
i had high hopes for this series it started out great but now it is dumb there are too many stories going at the same time and what happened to greats 4 minutes
 looks like the main character role should of been fuaiz right he is phenomenal imho havent seen the entire ep but i had to share before i forgot
tonkla and domes dad kinda had it coming to him imo i love the series but i wish this series was longer they could have done much more
personally they could have ended it with the scene in the hospital with tyme holding greats hand and apologizing i probably wont look at the last episode the only ending that would work for me is if they were both actually dead and they walk into the light holding hands
 rely on all the spoilers for final closure
ng handthe only other scenario that would make me smile is if all of what we have seen has taken place in four minutes and great actually survives with tyme at his bedside holding his hand the joke would be on us  of course neither scenario is going to occur so i will happily
i love how this show just showed us how each character arrived at their path of destruction and their regrets i am hoping episode 8 gives me a somewhat happy ending i need them to come out of this ok and recovering 
omg they are linked omg episode 8 cant come soon enough
fuaiz is putting on a show of acting this actor is so young and promising
i dont understand why this series is only 8 ep i hope the final episode isnt rushed next week
i actually dont know what im watching anymore lol ive seen so many scenarios  im just going with it atp
im so confused so did he dream about he and his grandma getting shot 
his grandma was shot when tyme was shot his 4 minutes starts and in his mind he is going back to the diary reading the diary is what started his plans for revenge
curious to know if anyone else thinks this series was rushed like they could have made it longer than 8 episodes theres just a lot of detail thats missing imo
 sorry maybe second or third episode
 except dome wasnt his brother and didnt die great rescued dome in the first episode
 yeah i cant remember which episode but he finds title and kills him with a rock like he did dome then previous he finds great and shoots him which we know now even tho he knows itll affect korn he still did it anyway
 i do like the series and think i will have to give it a second watch once i have that last episode to truly tie it all together but having all these short clips here and there riddles like you said got me  but longer series would have been great even more detailed etc
 he did remember the bloody rock it was from ton kla the actual scene will probably be shown next week thats why he went after great because he saw the video of them both great was shot because he is seen helping dump domes body
 tonkla  domes brother killed title then shot great
i really dont see how they can wrap all of this in one episode why didnt domes brother go after titlehe is the one that killed his brother
i dont feel that way however i could support a longer series its that good i find this labyrinth very intriguing like riddles i hate to try and figure out but cant avoid doing so hopefully it can lead to a second season or several spinoffs ie titles upbringing
totally agree
the cat
this series is so freaking good last episode it was reality from greats perspective and this one is reality for tonkla and the why for episode 6 and can we talk about how fuaiz is killing it with his acting 
fuaiz is without a doubt the star of this series his portrayal of tonkla is an outstanding performance
totally agree
now tyme gets 4 minutes they just added a whole nother scenario if he chooses to keep the diary then the events happen as is if he puts it back nothing changes as far as his own tl great still has a crappy friend like title to pull him into bs
why granny kept the diary is beyond me she knew her child fudged up and kept the evidence for what is granny the wicketkeeper if tyme didnt keep the diary all this wouldnt have unfolded if he did when did the 4 mins begin 
gosh the connection between tyme and great is deep i cant wait for episode 8 
 awesome thank you so happy we can connect again herei miss our standin you knowi stopped by every so often just to read comments  so true on your take on this onewhen i read your comment the other day i was like thats like youhope epi 8 wont disappoint n s2 soon
 its a pleasure to read yours as wellim happy to see my standin alumni herethe cast here is amazing but too the story gets condensed for mefamily of 10 in a one bedroom apartment kind of 
 hold up tiger  were you reading my thoughts just now just kidding  always nice to read what youre thinking seriously i agree with your input i wish this was more than an 8 episodes watch but know this rolls im all about n all in on s2 you know 
its like magnets but i think the plot its a little too much for 8 ep id say the production got too ambitiousseems like squeezing one semester of school in one weekthen everything turns all over the placehope that they have a second season to untangle everything
so many psychopaths in this series 
 muchsimas gracias  ah s lo recuerdo i agree totally if this is easily solved then it will just confirm how rushed everything was done because of time crunch im like you i like to see the whole nine yard maybe in season 2  just excited n awaiting episode 8
 eres super te acuerdas de mis gustos  im looking forward to the final episode to see how distorted things really are i will be totally disappointed if all is solved so easily its so good its gotta end just as good or better even with some senseless input
 i know you are super enthusiastic as it is kinda around what you enjoy watching i mean the writers did amazing with this one  forcing one to see think outside the box you know i would even say mind psychic hope win solves the case but remember he almost died trying 
 agree its intensely satisfying for some reason  the evil that lingers is so controlling glad many of us are enjoying such ominous series together i like you think our dear inspector win dies or will he finally reach justice by taking chief and his crew down
 thats right no i have not but im thinking i should
so truetypical be on clouddid you see dead friends forever
 hola mi amiga i believe so too his character is so deep n dark but hes the product of all hes experienced n its effects yes it will be nice if he makes it at the end n finds true love you know the psychological impact of this series is like none before it n im intrigued
 totally agreed it is a great series with lots twists n turns n mind psychyou know thiss probably the first time ive paid attention to the opening ost n im like it definitely foreshadowsforebodes something ominous n weve seen that n then someyes to a second season 
thus far the only sane person i see is ton kla he is the only 1 who sees how shee t life is and if you want it fixed you on your own im curious to know what will happen to him i hope he escapes and finds a person who will love him for real we shall see salut mon ami
lots of twists and turns i agree tho ep 7 seemed rushed  too many senerios still a great series
i look forward to fridays with 4minutes  such an interesting premise and the actors are all amazing a hug for everyone from the uk 
i cant believe he did thattt
i cantlike i really can not right now the way they keep us guessing is out of this world
theyve known each other since they were kids grandma they died at the same time   know it probably wont happen but can they save each other or be together in the after life jes and bible are incredible actors for me this is one of the best bl of 2024
now we know why tyme apologizes his parents started it all and he continued to mess with the order of things causing more heartache all for revenge i blame grandma for it she could of destroyed the evidence if she said nothing could be done apology is fitting
absolutely sets a new bar
well im a little confused
you way ahead of most of us then 
omg making sense nowi really like this series
 heres what i think great has already been shot at the beginning of ep 1 ep 15 is an unconscious great trying to rewrite events e6 is what really happened  e7 is tymes  tonklas backstory
please explain because i dont understand 
how are they going to wrap all this up in only one more episode
probably with a cliffhanger or it will all make sense once all episodes are put together by doc den with his research and fabulous insight hell present his findings to his colleagues for some reason i cant avoid thinking of natcha she probably knew too much
speechless right now love it dont want it to end one more episode left
lmao i wondered why on episode 6 tyme told great i see your still afraid of dogsthey knew each other from childhood
i love this show but this episode got me a more confused 
okay did anyone get this episode cus im so confused 
ok if i was confused before now im 100 lost
next episode better be like 3 hours cuz no way this is wrapping up with only one more episode
every episode leaves me with more questions than answers but i still really want to know how this all ends lol
i get confused with every episode smh 
what a thriller love it
so everyone dies in itvery sad
poor bible he gets shot or dies in all the characters he plays well not sure about maam chief
soooo trippy love this
en resumen mi estimado no salvo a nadie y encima se quedo pegado en su mundo 
the more i understand the more i get confused  i cant even guess how this is all going to end
 i think youre on to something there
im gonna venture and say ton kla takes out warit and fasai then life will become peaceful again with everyone dead except korn his father and stepmother doc den lukwa and nurses ann  bee we shall see
how on earth can there be only one episode remaining and still hope to resolve this plot in any other way than both of them dead story is now at least becoming clear and while this is a fascinating series romance is not what i would ever label it
i mean its a mind fuck they probably thought that was close enough 
agreed
so true
agree
yep
this is the only series that is going to drive me to drink aiyeee faints 
ahhhh omg so many questions were answered but i need more
