what if
according to this drama and i did not fact check it our brains continue to function for 4 minutes after the oxygen supply had been cut off what exactly happens during those 4 minutes this drama gives us an answer
the story is not as messy as i was made to understand it deals with what ifs would you react differently in the same situation if you are given the opportunity mostly these four minutes give time and space for the characters to grow and mature one from being a spoiled brat who cannot say no to his friends and is overprotected by his parents and the other one who almost ruined his life looking for revenge they become aware of their mistakes and learn from them
there are four distinct parts of the story 4 episodes of greats 4 minutesthe time before the brain completely shuts down and the person diesof a near death experience in the form of time travelling in order to mend his mistakes followed by two and a half episodes of the real life story one episode of the doctors wishful thinking 4 minutes and finally a half an hour resolution the first part is the longest giving us the viewers the same time great needed to understand whats going on the rest is a bit rushed and a little unsatisfying i would have liked to see the bad guys really suffer but even though they do get punished the hope that the society is ever going to change and get better is not there
i am glad i binge watched this because the suspense would have killed me  especially when at the end of the penultimate episode every good guy seems to have died none of the bad guys but every good guy
the production value here is exceptional it is very much evident that they tried really hard to give this drama a special feel and feelings there are just none of the good ones it is dark and depressing just like the story it is trying to tell mind you it is beautifully filmed and acted the special effects are just perfect the costumes are consistent with the running theme of a depressing and serious drama great is always in white and the doctor in black when not in scrubs
the writing is original and the story is wrapped up nicely the author seems to like until we meet again a lot given the star crossed lovers second couple storyline though somehow ambiguously with the main couple in a boat on a river inviting the query are they just out on a date or are they crossing the styx
another important feature apart from the number 4 are the clocks every time great looks at the clock it is 1100 no matter how much time it passes it is always 1100 until he realizes that he has only 4 min left to live when the clock suddenly changes to 1101 etc and everything that hes been experiencing is a coma dream due to a near death experience
and finally there are cats everywhere black and white plushies for the leads and a black cat which caused one of the second leads to lose his sanity there are a lot of cat food ads the question now is were the cats originally written in the script or were they added because of the ppl
the society this drama describes is a cruel one it is the weak who suffer in the hands of the rich and the powerful the poor are not helped by the people who are supposed to be there to protect them usually known as the police because of the overpowering corruption so they either bow down and suffer in silence or deal the justice themselves unfortunately for them it never ends well
the cinematography of this drama is extraordinary from filming angles to colour scheme everything is gray except for the mls red car to geometrical sets there are lots of circles and everything is important for the story it was pretty much obvious from the first episode that the events are not taking place in the real world the lack of colours and the number 4 showing up everywhere as well as the strange and ominous sounding music gave the very odd impression that not everything is what it seems
frankly i am surprised this drama has such high ratings give the complex story and the filming style it definitely is not one of the usual bls actually i would put scifi as the main genre here followed by crime and psychological and then maybe romance where characters happen to be gay the tone of this drama reminded me very much of 7 days to valentine where the storyline and production were just as dark and depressing not very romantic what is different here is the main actors cult following and the abundance of nc scenes which were by the way beautifully filmed i keep seeing the comments and the reviews saying in gist omg those nc scenes are hot i want more but never mention the plot or anything else that is actually important and really interesting here the producer knows its business and how to speak to teen audience just give them hot actors making out and they are happy who cares about the plot well i do and luckily for me they managed to strike a good balance between an engaging plot and a few soft porn scenes not as many as i thought there would be so everyones happy now
actually this drama should be watched just for its cinematography if nothing else in conclusion this is a difficult but a beautiful and a satisfying watch not for the fans of fluffy bls though
could have been a 1010
overall although i enjoyed the beginning things unraveled for me 8 episodes about 1 hour each aired on gagaoolala uncut httpsgagaoolalacomenvideos46884minutes2024 except thailand japan korea iqiyi uncut httpswwwiqcomalbum4minutessultrierversion20241zc6sune8fllangenus and cut version httpswwwiqcomalbum4minutes20241h7yndte6zxlangenus australia argentina brazil canada chile colombia mexico new zealand peru spain united kingdom and united states viu with some countries having the cut version thailand philippines indonesia malaysia hong kong macau myanmar singapore rakuten tv in japan and heavenly in south korea the cut version has nsfw shortenedcut and also cuts out some plot as well
content warnings most content warnings it has some very darkgraphic parts in it
what i liked
 mystery element
 grey characters
 use of the number 4 or things adding up to 4
 production value includes cinematography use of color as symbolism props to represent things
room for improvement
 not a fan of a flash forward or back as a hook for a series
 there were too many charactersplot to fully develop them all also pacing
 misleading trailer it felt that a different character is the main lead instead of a character people were led to believe
 tricking the audience not a fan of how that was done
 sweet moments that didnt actually happen
 cliched plot stuff
 no reason why a character had a girlfriend i couldnt support a romance because it was built to not be a romance
 cringey guitar playingserenading
 the intimate scenes were needed but they did not need to be that expliciti didnt need to glimpse an actors body part when walking around
 many scenes were too dark to see the actors faces or even what was happening even for scenes at night they need to put light on their faces
 nonsense stuff i cant comment on all of the medical things and their realism but i highly doubt any surgeon would spin his medical implements beforeduring a surgery that seemed to be a ton of papers for a small clipboard in ep 1 an investigator who didnt wear gloves at a crime scene in ep 4 a character oddly didnt wear a mask when he should have
 be on cloud decided to sell it to a company where it is only airing in 8 countries and perhaps 2 more and then had the gall to not respond anywhere to questions about the remaining 180 countries but instead posted about how to only watch it via official channels i dont mind companies needing money to get things made but they should have been clear about where and the why update after 5 weeks they had an actual international release and the reason was likely moneymaybe they couldnt say their whole release plan due to a contract but it still was bad to not have an official platform for 180 countries for 5 weeks
note about an actors age i didnt take off points for this but as an fyi 1 actor was likely 17 when he filmed several very explicit scenes age of majority in thailand is 20
 its valid to feel uncomfortable with a 17 year old actor doing explicit scenes and to not watch this series
 its valid to feel fine with a 17 year old actor who voluntarily agreed to do explicit scenes and had his parents permission and watchenjoy this series
 everyone gets to make that decision for themselves i hold no judgement either way for this example personally i am watching the series but im not rewatching that actors nc scenes

totally confusing 
this is very confusing series but that is also the highlight of the series it is like we are trying to put the pieces of a puzzle together like i thought like till the episode yeah a normal love drama then i like wth is happening it took me an hour after episode 6 to understand what was going on then when the 4 minutes of tyme came i was again damn confused but it was interesting at the same time like it is a perfect mix like toxicity romance crime thrilling and also scifi i like it but i dont recommend it for people who are new to bl theyll be like wtf is going on but my personal opinion i love it

great tyme continuum with no added sultriness
hello im great no i dont mean im doing great have you seen the show but that i am great ummm no im not saying im a great person have you seen the show but my name is great oh i give up im the crazy cat lady happy
anyway what did you make of me and my story wasnt it fun admittedly it isnt fun to die tyme and tyme again for your entertainment but you knew i was going to live didnt you
im grateful to my creators for putting me in one of the greatest bodies out there on whose head not a strand is out of place and whose body adonis and antinous would envy they also seem to have had a big budget which they mostly spent on interior design porn and renting cars from the fast and the bicurious outlet mall i have no objections i do wish the writers had been paid more because i really dont understand who i am and what has been happening to me i also didnt know how to feel about what was happening but fortunately the background music was always at hand to tell me
since im now alive  im not sure this might be a black mirror kind of situation  i have been lurking around the forums online to find out the truth ive pretty impressed by the hard work of the fandom there are some good theories out there but im still not sure i understand im a bit thick you see but thickness like size matters
ignore the following three paragraphs if pressed for time or to avoid plot details 
what im most confused about is perspective so when i was going into cardiac arrest  as were tyme and tonkla and everyone else whos ever been shot it would seem  i had four comatose minutes during which i could see four  consequential moments where i could have chosen a less evil path fun i love guilttripping some including my maker sammon argue that each of these moments is a pathway to an alternate reality but my physicist friend assures me that this is not how the manyuniverse theory works there reality splits every measurable moment because quantum decoupling happens every measurable moment besides neither the heart nor the brain are quantum systems but never mind also can an unconscious person see or hear or feel isnt that an oxymoron i for one certainly dont remember any of it before you accuse me of being pedantic know that sammon prides herself on her scientific and philosophical sophistication but the most existential question for me is this once we do enter this liminal space and choose an alternate reality what happens to the reality we leave behind do i die am i dead am i bruce willis in that movie
now there is also that whole other storyline involving online gambling tonkla korn win and nan i know you didnt care for any of it but bear with me did i see that too did tyme or were their storylines alone real all the time are my parents good or bad if good why did i see what i did if bad why did tyme see what he did fine lets allow that my perspective and that of an omniscient narrator can coexist but then didnt tonklas dead brother show up at one random point more confusingly if the four minutes represent opportunities where deaths could have been prevented didnt other deaths happen anyway are some lives more worth than others i mean i know my beautiful body is worth more than tymes grandmothers life or that bastard tonklas but still am i the asshole or is the universe fatalistic all the same and our subjunctive possibilities mere hallucinations if so whats the fucking point of all this
of course tyme is still in a huff about the fact that his perspective got half a measly episode but mine got six poor tonkla he fared even worse while were at it what in crazy cat ladys name was that last episode all about im so confused and i dont know why my creators were in such a hurry to wrap things up i dont even understand why im still alive and why tymes still alive but not my brother why did he have to kill himself dont we all have blood on our hands also who chooses these realities for us sammon if so why choose these and not one in which my story actually makes sense as i said the writers should have been paid more if they were paid at all but then all those cute moments between me and tyme  it satisfied you lot didnt it how many of you screamed at the last shot good im happy for you im happy for us too not for my brother though
 here endeth knowledge 
i know some of you thought my sex scenes with tyme were a tad on the soft side listen i know my body and the fact that i was listening to limp bizkit all of next day is no coincidence tyme is a great lover and he bore his arse out for you be greatful but i will admit that bastard tonkla stole the show from me never trust a power bottom were you really surprised when he shot me and revealed his face in the campest way possible id say im glad hes dead but id still love to have had a great tyme with him and win and korn and yes of course id have sex with my murderer if hes hot enough  ask any selfrespecting gay man besides you all saw a flash of jjays pjj didnt you how many times did you go back freeze the frame and thought to yourself ive become my mother
oh one last thing why 4 minutes you ask it is apparently the length of time it would take for consciousness to fade after the heart stops during which you can enter an alternate dimension alternate reality alternate universe or whatever else is alternate thats what the lastminute narrator  where the fuck did she come from  says turns out not possible anoxia induces loss of consciousness in 6 seconds and inflicts permanent brain damage within 2 minutes you should have seen the first draft of this review there are parts of my brain to which i no longer have any access so i can only guess that my creators were listening to madonna on repeat on spotify as they fell asleep or while doing cocaine and concluded with mr timberlake there were only 4 minutes left to save the world
readers digest
do say in search of lost tyme
dont say the great catsby
could have been the next kinnporsche
i watched this with great expectations the first episode was intriguing with the whole look into the future for 4 minutes thing but as the series went on it changed from intriguing to downright confusing the 4 minutes became a blur and different realities were so mixed together that you werent able to tell what exactly went with what if this series had been more straightforward it could have been on the level as kinnporsche
but i thought the acting was superb and i am now a bigger fan of these actors bible and jes made a perfect pairing i especially loved the dreamlike sequence where they were extremely happy together the story about tonkla was heartbreaking and i shed a few tears for that whole situation
but overall the way they made it soooo confusing i didnt really enjoy it very much and i wont be watching it again
4minuts
i have watched tons of bls the last few years and i know very well how they have evolved when they first started bls had very similar settings and plots most of them took place in universities or high schools thats how the engineer faculty joke came to be
at some point bl series started gaining tons of viewers and attention and companies started as expected to invest more and more in this particular genre as a result from characters that were usually high schoolers and university students we started watching on our screen so many different main leads from doctors and office workers to supernatural entities and mafia bosses
the thing is that in the majority of these series no matter how entertaining or well made they may be the plot felt more like a background that was there just to envelop the main characters and their romance it felt like the writers were not actually ready to create a well written and logical plot since it was out of their comfort zone
and here comes 4minutes to get this out of the way this series is not perfect but i can clearly see it is an earnest effort to make a unique drama that deviates from the usual tropes
4minutes has amazing directing and cinematography in simple words it is visually stunning it has an immaculate dark atmosphere good music and good acting of course since this is the sultrier version there are quite a few explicit scenes that are also pretty well done but not for the fainthearted the chemistry between the characters is good and their love stories are also good enough
and here comes the usual black sheep the plot 4minutes has an actually well written intricate and complicated plot or to be more precise thats what they want the audience to believe the plot itself is not that complicated and until the end it is easy to put all the pieces in the correct place things are getting clearer and clearer with each episode but because the concept is special and because of some directing choices the plot seems to be much more confusing and complex than it is in reality and i am saying this as positively as possible
4minutes has a quite unique plot compared to many series and not only bls it has flawed characters that dont feel like the typical toxic ones we usually watch and enjoy to hate it is one of the few times that despite the love stories and the many gay main leads i could feel that the plot was actually more important than the romance that it was there to serve a purpose something that is obvious from the viewers themselves people were not talking that much of the romantic relationship between the mains and the good looking cast they were making theories about the plot they were trying to solve it like a riddle and that is what makes 4minutes a great pun intended series despite its flaws
and what are those flaws some of the acting performances here and there could have been better and some plot points could have been developed in a different manner
however the thing that actually bothered me the most has to do with the emotional aspect of the series i just didnt feel for the characters and their stories i think that this is the biggest flaw of 4minutes i could acknowledge that i was watching something well made but emotionally wise it didnt move me it didnt make me gasp i wanted that something more i wanted to feel for the characters and for their relationships more than i did
all in all despite the negative aspects 4minutes was definitely worth the watch and it felt like a huge breath of fresh air it doesnt follow the formula we have seen again and again during the past few years and it was a memorable enough watch that differentiated itself from everything else putting the plot and not the romance in the foreground

perfect production but messy story
this bl was highly anticipated by many boc bible jes this is a potentially golden combination and it started off just as promising many different storylines that we could see were related but how exactly was a big question a lot of questions got answered from around ep 4 but a lot still remained obscure what exactly did these 4 minutes mean and what was real because apparently some events were fictional ep 5 and 6 gave us answers but for me those were not really the ones we were looking for and even more questions were raised who died and if they did who killed them tha last two eps wrapped it all up but not in a neat little package and we are still left with whys hows and whos should we have seen some bigger picture i did not find it if it was there
overall the acting is superb as is the production perfect lightingcoloring and stages big love here as for the other parts of the show like consistency story music theres still some to be desired it felt like there were parts of the story missing not as much essential parts but still important setting the scene parts we are thrown into one scene after another and are left to our own devices to connect them all which coukld have worked out great but i still felt like we were looking at an unfinished product
maybe it was my expectations that were too high or maybe it was bocs ambitions that were too high
i did also spot some references to kinnporsche more subtle like in some shots but also very in your face like the song why dont you stay by jeff satur but here not sung by jeff satur
i will rewatch this at some point and maybe then i will adjust my review
imperfectly enjoyable
not everything has to be top notch for you to enjoy a viewing experience it wasnt a perfect watch and nothing about this was truly unique or outstandingly mindblowing from the premise to the acting to its characters but i have to say that this show felt unique to me from the get go im cant pinpoint it though it may be that im still pretty new to bls and asian dramas in general so it could be that this being more focused on a openly complicated plot it having that much steam and romance not being the star of the show surprised me when compared to the other stuff that ive seen so far but mostly i felt like the people behind it had clear intentions and ideas going in in ways making me think that while wanting to try something new they still didnt do shit without a clear motive behind every shot or line of dialogue its extremely admirable to me and i can honestly say there wasnt a single second in this where i felt bored watching it of course this doesnt mean that they were actually successful in making the product i know they wanted to make i do think there are a few issues that they need to fix going in into the sequel to make up for a confusing start before naming a few of them i just want to be clear that by confusing i dont necessarily mean the mystery behind the plot and that im only critiquing the show out of genuine passion and excitement for whats to come whats confusing to me is the script i can see the ideas i can see the potential but then maybe the inexperience or the fact that they wouldntcouldnt make this a couple more episodes long there were moments where a scene would feel incohesive with the the previous or the next as if they had to skip some content for them to be able to cram everything in an 8hour long product mind you i finished the last episode without feeling like i just wasted my time so im sure they did the best they could with what they had but then again if the writing was somehow better it would have benefited everything in here especially with the characters the main characters had some pretty fucked up things happening to them both in their backstories and their present but with it being so plotheavy and the writing having to make sure they didnt leave anything important out the character development itself suffered which leaves me feeling like they have developed but unfortunately i dont get to see it in a satisfying way that also means that if the writing isnt completely there then the acting performance also suffers the only case i felt where a character had a pretty much good arc is korn which felt pretty linear the script did help the actor immensely with a pretty straightforward arc for him and bas is already a talent on his own probably the best one out of the cast if i only have to judge from what you see in this series that can partially be said for the actor and character of ton kla as well i also know jes and bible to be very good and expressive actors and i did enjoy their performances but unfortunately scenes werent written for them to shine and show their acting abilities
in conclusion yes in a way this does feel like kind of a missed opportunity and theres definitely some big room for improvement but at the same time this had remarkable photography a pretty thrilling pacing interesting ideas left and right and i had the best time watching trying to guess all the possibilities and ways they story could go i know it looks like im kinda bashing it but i assure you bullying is how i flirt and i flirted a lot with this bl definitely worth a watch
edit also someone just reminded of the insane amount of isdin ads that were thrown left and right it really did send me through the roof every time the camera sat for a few seconds on a bottle of sunscreen though on a serious note it surely aligns with my idea that unfortunately the people behind it needed the funding so good on them if that helped with the production side of things

what happened vs what could have happened
the concept is quite brilliant but the execution could certainly have been better
the explanation for the bewildering scenes for many of the episode is basically that for people whose brains are oxygendeprived and they are on the brink of death or in a coma they hallucinate about what their lives could have been had they done something different
at the start of the series great sees himself knocking a woman down with his car and driving off when the vision ends he drives and knocks someone down without driving off irresponsibly changing the course of events eventually however it turns out that great does not see 4 minutes into the future at all the series of events happening following the hitandrun is the reality whereas the other series of events is just something that goes on in his mind when he is in danger of dying
some find it highly unsatisfactory that so much of the series feature the hallucinations rather than the reality to me it is fine as the hallucinations reveal their most deepseated desires and make the reality especially poignant when it is revealed nonetheless i think there are issues since what we are seeing isnt premised on traveling back in time to fix the past or predicting the future to change something for the better what we are seeing is what could have happened rather than what would have happened in other words the alternative story just a story spun by the dying brains of the characters rather than a definite course of events this does compromise the emotive quality of the series
it also seems to me that the explanation doesnt really explain things at one point we are led to think that tonkla senses the presence of his brother who has been killed but based on the explanation this makes no sense whether we are watching the reality or greats imagined series of events the two do not mix unless greats imagination can invade the reality that tonkla experiences furthermore it is quite confusing that when great supposedly sees four minutes into the future there are glances of himself being intimate with time that happen way after the four minutes the visions seem to be simply planted there to intrigue viewers and perhaps titillate them with glimpses of sex scenes i also feel that in the hallucinated series of events there are scenes that great wouldnt be imagining simply because they do not involve him eg time at the hospital overhearing what his colleagues say about his relationship with another doctor and are not quite relevant to the alternative reality that his dying brain so badly wants
when it comes to the bl the relationship between great and time in the real version of events isnt developed well we do not see enough of how times feelings for great develop and see more of him being obsessed with avenging his parents who were killed as for the other bl couple three characters actually tonklakorn or tonklawin there are just many sex scenes without emotional intensity the story seems to vacillate between showing korn as someone who deeply loves tonkla and showing him as someone who does not truly care about him tonklas apparent preoccupation with wanting to have unprotected sex seems nonsensical and added in just for dirty talk even though one might come up with some labored explanation for it win is interesting but lacks developmentthe final episode is a little too rushed for a series that seems to take its time to reveal things to us
ultimately the freshness of the concept and the way the series pushes boundaries in depicting sex and nudity in bls may garner this series a lot of attention but it is unlikely remembered as a classic that is executed with finesse in every way

omg
the quality of this production is excellent everything is clicking ost acting and intimate scenes the visuals flow with a professional quality im watching the sultier version in episode one the scene with korn was hot on a more personal levelkinnporcshe escalated the type of sex scenes portrayed in bl series and i think 4 minutes will do the same dont get me wrong i enjoyed the explicit nature of korns scene and the passion portrayed but at what level does bl cross over into pornography is it pornography with an actual plot great acting and human emotions or is it an explicit bl on a different level just asking im still enjoying it and am definitely watching the rest of this series
after completion
the production was significantly superior to many bls the cinematography the acting the musiceverything the only negative was the time skipping that really got confusing it felt like the story didnt completely flesh out i think if i rewatch it ill probably pull more of the subtle elements of the story together better bible and jes as a couple was a definite winner ill always be disappointed that build was treated so badly and had his career ruined by that mental shank he dated boc however recovered the pairing with bible and jes bible seems like an awesome person and i hope the very best for his future had to throw my 2 cents in about the whole build fiasco as i stated ill wait a couple weeks then binge watch 4minutes again i definitely think ill enjoy it more since i know the overall story of the script now
so sultryly good
it gets more exciting after each episode making me finish this in one day i love the concept that the 4 minutes are based on its very interesting and meaningful at same time
what im impressed is how well executed this is i was initially worried that i may get confused because of the storyline but it actually is very clear there are lots of details being shown that helps you connect the dots very easily as long as you follow through each episode closely its seriously really good
the plot twist are amazing the acting are also very good not cringey at all i especially love jes and bible here i also love korn and tonkla despite the ending
ncs are sooo goood be on cloud really knows what its doing now what i like is how the ncs are a bonus and not the selling point weve seen lots of bl that just gave you nc with crap story this is not one of those
this is seriously so high quality on all levels 8 episodes are perfect anything more would be draggy althou ill totally take a special episode to watch more jes and bible
another great one from be on cloud but this is not a romance
warning  no spoilers but some mild comments which will be separated by lines from the rest of the review
there was no way they could have given this series a satisfactory ending if not for that one although its bittersweet and a couple of threads could have been better tied up
one thing id like to warn about however is if youre looking for romance this is not the right show not that theres not any but its honestly not the heart of the drama though they did give some fan service here and there esp in the final episode in spite of the lack of nc scenes in the final episode
great was never great but by the time we reached the end of this journey he had learned to be better im mostly sad for tonkla but he crossed a line he should never had at least korn redeemed himself though not by choice but because he was driven to it
the show was made confusing on purpose and its one of those that its better not to know anything about before you start but at the same time that confusion is probably what the character we mostly follow felt
why dont you stay was my favorite song in kinnporsche so it was pretty nice to hear it sung in another voice in the final episode
overall a great watch i personally dont mind nc scenes as long as theres no violence involved  bdsm or whatever is a big no some are relatively graphic so it might have hurt some peoples sensitivities but personally i watched it for the story so whether there were nc scenes or not didnt make a difference though i do think some of the earlier scenes with tonkla felt too gratuitious
honestly i still feel a bit overwhelmed so i dont know how to write anything coherent apart from that i loved that show from its very first minute and that it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout its 8 weeks long run
i have nothing but praise for the actors and for the whole crew who worked on this little gem which are so so so rare in thai bls
bible delivered but i was confident hed pull it off but jes fuaiz and bas were nice discoveries ill keep on following their next projects whether they act together again or not
you need to be completely immersed in the story
this series hits me harder than i expected i was completely immersed in it as if i was living it just finished now the last episode and i dont know exactly what to feel yet definitely my favorite thai series right now
the plot is really cool and interesting but you need to pay 100 attention all the time its this kinda show that have lot of little details that you may think doesnt matter but trust me it matters
its different from the usual i guess not many people like this kinda show because may seems confused sometimes i was confused too but in a good way of experience the direction did a great job im really impressed and completely in love with everything about 4 minutes the photography is so perfect people complain about being too dark but to me that fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the series i can understand if you think thats its a bad point but to me its not
the acting of bible was insane i have no words to express what i felt bib was perfect as great in general i think the cast did a amazing job i really felt that guy that did ton kla was insanely good too his eyes was completely on the character he made ton kla so real spotlights on him
now to me that one who did win was kinda off sometimes feels weird he wasnt bad but side with ton kla he wasnt good though
about the chemistry great and tyme was fire stunning i loved definitely good partners both was really nice on the characters loved everything about ton kla and win felt so not cool but had chemistry idk exactly what to say about them just weird to me how win became close to ton kla now about korn and ton kla yeah had chemistry too but i didnt like korn in the beginning he was bad but its okay because ton kla is also bad and crazy and we loved it lol
now that dude and that girl wasnt that random and off like some people are saying chill guys theyre cute and just that relax
the ending was definitely surprised i was expecting lot of differents endings but this yeah let me without words i dont know how i feel yet to be honest
this show hits really harder when youre struggling with maladaptive daydreaming thats my case insane got me really drowning thats interesting to me need to think a lot
what i loved the most
 acting great ton kla and korn was definitely on point
 atmosphere really deep and dark immersive
 photography cheff kiss mwah
what i didnt like
 i felt like something is missing on the last episode but i cant say what just have a feeling
 sometimes the way that some scenes was switching was off and confuse in not a good way
 that guy who did ton kla was a minor when did the sex scenes thats definitely not cool ok boc
plus they should have put this on global viki rakuten didnt get why just few country and differents streaming services
strong start average finish
4minutes actually started out great but the last 2 episodes were not impressive there are a few unanswered questions and the final episode has a few confusing moments which dont make sense unfortunately or at least they were quite ambiguous and just leave the audience to fill the gap
i ended up starting the sultier version and it is definitely graphic there is partial nudity especially involving a minor at the time of shooting so it is good that there is a censored version as well watch whatever you are most comfortable with
i rarely watch bls but the plot summary and title were what intrigued me i enjoy mysteries and it was definitely fun trying to decipher the clues in each episode before the clarity of the situation finally hits so thats where it started to be less enjoyable there are a few editing issues that didnt make sense but dont affect the plot i was still surprised these things werent caught
the show really was a 910 for me midway so i expected a strong finish but sadly they were unable to deliver i felt disconnected from some of the characters by the end because their actionsreactions seemed strange and some characters dont have the chemistry we were expecting so it feels unbelievable it is sad because they really could have done well if they covered all their bases and hadnt skipped crucial moments and elaborated things further i feel disappointed because i had higher hopes but it is worth watching for the suspense
so amazing but the last episodes were weak
this show is definitely worth watching i loved the plot that just kept you on your toes and the amount of theories i created was not healthy i just felt like the last twothree episodes were in stark contrast to the rest of the show and much weaker
positives
 bibles acting he was once again just convincing natural and just truly a great actor
 the plot the writing of the plot progression was super interesting how they kept dropping hints and kept us guessing the characters were also super interesting especially how they were morally grey flawed and complex
 the nc scenes even though i wasnt the biggest fan of the pairings in this theyre chemistry wasnt amazing but that wasnt the point of the show at all so its fine all the nc scenes were full of chemistry incredibly nuanced natural and wellused as storytelling devices probably my favourite nc scenes ever
negatives
 the last twothree episodes the dialogue felt offforced the acting suddenly felt unnatural they tried to wrap upexplain the previous plot in a way that made it feel silly that dissolved all this great tension theyd previously built in an insignificant way truly am a bit disappointed
all in all still an amazing series maybe not that much rewatch value since it lives off the plottwist truly couldve been a 10 star if theyd kept up the theme with the last episodes

first things first i want to applaud this show for being probably one of the few that actually has me hooked till the end in these past months ive watched bl it wasnt that hard to finish i think the fact that it has 8 episodes which is a perfect amount plays a part too because god 12 episodes is so much and a lot of shows have that amount so they really stretch out the story to the point it gets boring midway but this show had me hooked i think the way they made each episode flow was very helpful too they made sure to confuse the fuck out of everyone in each episode enough to make you wanna continue to the next so your questions can be answered and trust me if youve watched till the last episode all of your questions will be answered so there really is no reason why people should be confused but if you still are im going to explain what this story was about in my words if theres anything i misinterpreted or missed then ill take the blame lol but so far what i got was in the first couple of episodes it shows great and his experiences at first it shows him living that 4 minutes life but in reality hes really in the hospital having a near death experience then between the middle it shows more info about other characters and then it shows the reality of great so basically what great actually experienced where he actually runs over the girl and all that towards the end it shows tyme and his near death experience and he was also experiencing the same thing as great in the sense of the 4 minutes and such then at the end they recover and live happily so what is there to unpack here this whole show was based on 2 people who were experiencing a near death experience and once youre dying i guess you just relive what youve experienced any guilt or regret you have will transform into the opposite in your brain thats why great could see 4 minutes into the future and basically fix his mistakes and thats why tyme had a whole different life with great during his 4 minute experience he had a good relationship with great and they were dating but in their actual reality tyme didnt have the best relationship with great and he treated him pretty badly so when great got shot that guilt stayed with him and great regretted running over the girl and also helping or not doing anything to stop title from killing dome and more interactions or decisions so this whole near death experience was a way for the brain and body to cope with the regrets of life and they kind of created their own reality thats why both great and tyme have a whole different viewperspective on how they met and the experiences they had together but the reality isnt even close to what they both created thankfully both survived and lived to what seems to be happy yay everything seemed to be resolved sadly dome korn and tonkla passed away honestly they all deserved better and the fact that korn killed himself after tonkla died makes this an even more depressing love story between them and poor dome he was so innocent and kind based on what we saw he didnt do anything and the cop win idk i did ship tonkla and korn but i first saw fuaiz tonkla and jjay wincop in dff dead friend forever and they were a couple there so this is what i was kind of hoping would happen here too but i guess in either shows do they have a happy ending tt poor jjay but yeah this is pretty much it i also have to applaud those nc scenes omg it was giving kinnporsche but nothing beats kinnporsche anyway the only things i would switch about this show is probably making it a little less confusing for the viewers i like the fun in looking forward to the next episode but they really had me confused for a couple episodes until the end where i was like ohhhh and i guess include a little more romance in it i know this is a specific genre and the romance is there but just a tiny bit more would make this show a little more enjoyable but overall pretty good in my opinion this show is good to watch once i probably will never rewatch but to give it a try i will for sure recommend
this was sooo good
i really liked this drama already watched twice to wrap my head truly around it i like a good drama bl or not and a bl that does to need all tropes to be successful this was thought provoking about redemption and trying to get it right
the actors were excellent in making the characters pull us in great job when you hurt for a character even if they are flawed you know they have done their job this may not be for everyone this is not the fluffy love story you need to think i would say the rewatch factor is high not just for nc scenes but the story
confusing but somewhat gripping
it was a really great watch  to begin with and then in the gap from episode 56 it was like a whole different storyline was happening for no reason and even when the reason was revealed later on i still didnt understand a thing its too hard to differentiate between the timelines and i only binge watched this over 2 days so if you leave gaps between the episodes youll come back to it like ok what the hell is going on now if theyd simplified the 4 minutes thing it could have been a 9 or 10
i really didnt grasp what the 4 minutes were how they happened why they happened  any of it maybe im just dim which ruined it for me
but the acting was amazing the bravery of them to do those things on camera especially young fuaiz hes in the wrong job if you get me bas was a bl revelation  from bodyguard to boss
as a side note when i saw jjay with facial hair on insta i thought nah but on tv and without makeup or anything he actually suits it better than most

huh
this might be one of the most peculiar and disturbing compilation of ads
that ive ever had the dubious pleasure to click through on double speed
while praying that a triple speed option would magically appear on the video playback speed controller
i mean such an unabashed waste of talent time energy and money has to be illegal
standing ovation on the underage sex scenes well done entertainment industry heres your cookie
with all the money that was poured into thiscinematic creation they surely could have put dozens of kids from underprivileged backgrounds through med school twice
and now im just sitting here gnawing on my nails worriedsick charlie kaufman might actually faint from all the laughter and would have to get hospitalized if he ever happens to watch this or from all the crying maybe both
what if he has enough unwasted bad karma and this actually happens
what would the wachowski sisters think lmao
ryan gosling once mentioned the two for them one for yourself rule my hopeful guess is  for the one whose nickname does not correlate all too well with this abomination of a storytelling this has to be the one for them also could these they finally leave the grannies alone please pretty please havent the grannies suffered enough just stop it already better yet to paraphrase an old song leave the grannies and the kids alone and the cats ok
emm lets see
the durexs money could have been gone as the intimacy choreographers wage naturally
the cat foods and the sunscreens money combined  as the medical advisors wage deservedly
loooved how they thoroughly transcribed all the medical terms very important educational please forgive my sarcasm
but then something must have gone terribly wrong in the writers room
because surely they only had money left for the cheap counterfeit vodka for a fuel and the deadline was yesterday oh boy that must have been tough counterfeit vodka can make one dowrite things looking back one might not be so proud of
ok then sounds pretty plausible to me
or at least just as plausible as all the nappy marrow that went down within these longest ever 4 minutes
hopefully i might be able to unsee it with a heavy dose of baby elephants vids
fingers crossed
yeah thats what i thought youd do [slightly derogatory]
i came into this show knowing i loved about half the creatives and hated about half the creatives so it was always going to be a bestoftimesworstoftimes situation for me i was honestly pleasantly surprised where we ended up high production values and an interesting concept will get you quite far and 4minutes had both in spadesplenty enough to cover some fumbling of plot lines and moderately lackluster romance though i think in the end i enjoyed the concept of this series more than the actual series itself i am going to send out tweets telling me when its finished friends to pick up so i guess they got me there
the full review
story
sammon sammon sammon its always the same shit with you isnt it women bleeding from their pregnancyrelatedillnesses a solid attempt at medical accuracy awkwardstiff romance in all the strangest places and an ending that never quite manages to kill enough of its darlings to stick the landing and illegal casinos now i guess im being rude
i think 4minutes is actually quite a bit stronger than dead friend forever and tighter than manner of death while the ending still dragged i think there was an attempt to really bring all the pieces full circle that improved the quality of the series overall i loved the concept a lot and felt that there was a reasonably good use of the 4minutes concept throughout the narrative the strongest being in the earlier episodes
that said i think pacing and execution was quite sloppy the first four episodes were full of intrigue and suspense but the later episodes didnt keep pace conceptually as the action sped up the 4minutes touchstones were lost to a lot of montage and time skips that made it difficult to stay invested in the timebending narrative i ended up feeling much more connected to the characters on the grounded timeline
acting
well theres no coy way to say it i think fuaiz and bas stole the show entirelybut i dont think it was entirely their doing everyone in this show is at worst a competent actor and at best really quite an interesting performer however the structure of the story was much kinder to the characters in reality in terms of audience connection and the ability to build character
fuaiz and bas had very traditional character arcs we get an initial impression of their characters and then slowly the plot reveals the layers of their psyche for fuaiz i loved the balance of how cold and calculating he tries to be over top the much more unstable distress the way he broke and then smoothed over the pain was heartwrenching and won me over immediately for bas the struggle between his responsibilities was not quite so intriguing to me until it built to breaking point in the final episode really beautifully raw emotion coming through with very little dialogue
for jes and bible i was less impressed i was surprised because i loved bible as vegas but the shift between greats 4minutes ideal reality reality as we know it tymes 4minutes reality and the new normal really lost their characters along the way and the romance with it they felt less dimensional and less stable as characters over time not more real the performances in any given moment were solid but they didnt add up to a coherent character it was a little flat
for the stand out ensemble i am going to take a minute to once again bitch that be on cloud is absolutely wasting jet by using him in these onedimensional villain characters i watched all of the hidden character and i fell absolutely in love with rendition of porsche and i want to see that actor again stop punishing him for a bad choice in partner a year ago and give him something to work with
production
gorgeous as always though not quite on par with kinnporsche i think the stand out moments of this series were the moments when reality and the 4minute experience begin to blend the snatches of spotthedifference were beautifully chosen and very alluring unfortunately some of the other shots got a little muddled and confusingsome of the darkness too dark and unstructured to be clear some of the effects in the dream scene nauseating and some of the choices a bit cute for the kind of production they were having these werent overly offensive though
the only two choices i really disliked were the stupid stuffed animals no one should take gmmtvs lead in shoving blatant merch opportunities into their series and the use of why dont you stay leave what is special to each production where it is youve gone above and beyond to differentiate this from kinnporsche and separate the cast from what they were in that series the cover was a misstep and quite poorly sung
intimacy
ok the nc scenes were realistic and artistic i enjoyed the way we were introduced to characters and their personalities through their sex scenes i think there was clear purpose and choice for the degree of explicitness these scenes were shot with and i think they really pulled them off well in that regard i hope that despite pond seemingly awarding himself the title intimacy director with no training these shoots were a positive experience for the cast
that said they werent hot lol thats the best way i can think to phrase my complaint despite such a degree of explicitness and nakedness very few of these scenes had a good sense for chemistry and connection the plot was clear the choices and conflict was clear but the connection wasnt really happening in the moment the pacing and framing always stumbled in a way that prevented them from being great it feels like a step backwards if i am being honest
in all i knew i was going to struggle with this show and the show struggled in exactly the places i expected it to so if you really like be on clouds postkinnporsche work or youre a huge sammon fan youll probably have a great time no pun intended if you like me dont i think its still worth watching and interesting work in its own right i think this company is still finding its footing and discovering its voice this was a pretty good attempt
wow im glad i binge watched
this was amazing bibles acting was fabulous i was worried id keep seeing vegas but how wrong i was im so glad i saved this to binge watch as i wouldve been pulling my hair out having to wait for each episode
i read the comments before going to watch this and had been worried that the plot may be confusing but i followed along no problem loved it
 stay  had me in tears twice this is definitely going on my rewatch list
i cant wait to see the next boc offering hopefully with jesbible as their chemistry was fire

challenging but worth it
i didnt want to get too detailed but okay let me be real i have thoughts
the narrative explores the themes of guilt and regret and asks each character to look at their life and choices through the lens of the mysterious moments the four minutes between life and death
whats challenging and provocative i think about this series is the nonlinear narrative which appears at first very tangled and confusing however this series unravels those tangled webs of time and memory and provides us with in actuality a very simple story the nonlinear approach effectively shapes that simple story about the follies and sins of its characters into a rumination on the unknowable mysteries of consciousness memory and imagination using memory as a vector the series takes moments from its characters past connects it to their present and transposes them into the 4 minutes dreamworld the intangible fourthdimensional liminal space between life and death this space crosses the boundaries of consciousness and imagination itself with characters reliving past moments making changes to their own memories and even seemingly communicating with each other through shared imagination
one character quantifies this into his 4 minutes theory exploring the idea that these moments between life and death can reveal a persons true character or at least who they want to be at the same time the real world looms over telling us that no one can change the past letting each regret hang over like an executioners axe as the series progresses were painfully aware that great couldnt actually do anything to change the events that preceded his near death experience that his experience in the 4 minutes was just his regret and imagination at work
still though this is the truth revealed about 4 or 5 episodes in were still left with many unknowns about these 4 minutes indeed in a very fitting ending were left questioning some aspects of what was real and what was in these dreams if it was simply imagination then why did it seem as though characters learned things they didnt know before or seemed as though they were having a shared experience within the 4 minutes
the series never really aims to answer these questions and so doesnt because the real heart of the story isnt to give a definitive answer to these mysteries but rather to answer the question of whether given the chance a person would change themselves for the better and so a change does happen perhaps great couldnt change the past but he could and does change his future which is ultimately what saves his life in the end

phenomenal but confusing until i got it
starting from episode 1 and beyond the series kept me intrigued later on the storyline became confusing until i figured out what was going on then my intrigue became sadness but brightened by the end heres my formula fantasy reality fantasy reality hope it helps
the acting was phenomenal i loved great and tyme as a couple the actors chemistry was off the charts shout out to jes jespipat tilapornputt as dr tyme i had never seen his work before he was top tier in this series in fact all the actors were fantastic their acting kept me immersed in the show and coming back for more
the sex scenes are definitely nsfw but i didnt feel like they were just thrown in there for ratings depending on how they had sex and under what circumstances i felt these scenes established the emotional and mental state of each of the characters for example do me raw indicated to me the characters feelings of worthlessness and guilt with their need to be punished for their crimes
i found the camera angles really interesting also the use of colour throughout was excellent and well thought out i liked that the support roles had substance and werent mere shadows
i look forward to rewatching this series with an even greater understanding next time i appreciated the time and effort by the cast  crew that was put into the making of this show i imagine it was exhausting but i think it was well worth it
one of the best gay drama series i have seen
fantastic series great acting from main cast great cinematography story had me on edge of my seat a knockout for any fan of bl drama i loved this show it is definitely in my top bl shows of all time i hope the trend continues for more shows to branch out from typical tropes that hamper other bl shows
bl of the year goes to 4 minutes the series
bl of the year 
wonderful plot acting cinematography costume everything is top notch
first time it feels like the plot is actually plotting this series is not like other typical bl drama it has its different aura and quality which will attract you and make you crave more and more
better than any other bl i have watched
4 minutes is really a cut above the bls i have seen before indeed as a casual bl fan i never imagined i would create an account here and post a review but here we are
the show sets itself up quickly despite the synopsis this is really the story of two hot young rich brothers twinky great and hunky korn the bros lives are turned upside down almost immediately as the series starts korn because he finds out his parents business is not simply the respectable freight and shipping company it seems to be great on the other hand realises he can see exactly 4 minutes into the future or can he
now we are ready for the superfun dark twisty and sexy romp to commence what sets 4 minutes apart is that it actually stands its ground as a very solid if implausible and the best ones are crime thriller part gritty part glamorous the characters personalities make sense and their decisions are believable given the extraordinary situations they find themselves in the pacing is uniquely for a bl suitably fast even propulsive at times
the acting directing editing and set design make your typical bl look like firstyear drama school productions by comparison the show also avoids some of the more irritating common bl tropes the bad guy goons are not universally incompetent for example though their masters still spend an inordinate amount of time drinking posh spirits the bottoms are not all wideeyed virgins  they are even on prep and beg for it raw
the supernatural element is also devised and deployed with great care maturity and sophistication some have complained that some plot elements remain frustratingly vague and confusing but for me that works because it serves to advance the ambiguity around the nature of greats seemingly magical ability
lastly the nc  i still have no idea what that acronym stands for  scenes wow these are sexy and hot but not at all gratuitous they serve the plot very well my only gripe they are edited in such a way that the tops appear to climax within a couple of minutes of penetration that is not how it is supposed to work lads
we will have to wait and see whether the writers are able to bring all the various threads of 4 minutes plot together satisfactorily in the conclusion but even if they dont the ride will have been worth it i cannot wait for the next episode just watch this drama
confusing plot bad chemistry bad acting too much nc scene
confusing plot bad chemistry bad acting too much nc scene
up until this momment i write this review there is no one that really explain to me what is the 4minutes plot i guess not all people get the storyline its look like the title 4 minutes its not match with the storyline everything doesnt make any sense
the main couple face too look a like both look like brother than a lover so its very hard to imagining them together as a lover the chemistry is 0 their nc scene is meh for me not adding any plot and no chemistry at all the main couple storyline is too force flat and blend no dinamic after all i dont like it at all

first impression
this show is going to be fantastic i already knew this show was going to be great just from watching the trailer but so far for this being the first episodethis show is unbelievably amazing the concept alone is amazingnot to mention the cinematography is absolutely stunning along with the plot and cast i can just tell this show is going to be a rewatch for me once its finished
alongside the nc sceneit is an absolute masterpiece already the sidecoupleyeah you heard me the sidecouples nc scene is so fantastic and intense that im sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the next episode on friday
could have been a 1010
overall although i enjoyed the beginning things unraveled for me 8 episodes about 1 hour each aired on gagaoolala uncut httpsgagaoolalacomenvideos46884minutes2024 except thailand japan korea iqiyi uncut httpswwwiqcomalbum4minutessultrierversion20241zc6sune8fllangenus and cut version httpswwwiqcomalbum4minutes20241h7yndte6zxlangenus australia argentina brazil canada chile colombia mexico new zealand peru spain united kingdom and united states viu with some countries having the cut version thailand philippines indonesia malaysia hong kong macau myanmar singapore rakuten tv in japan and heavenly in south korea the cut version has nsfw shortenedcut and also cuts out some plot as well
content warnings most content warnings it has some very darkgraphic parts in it
what i liked
 mystery element
 grey characters
 use of the number 4 or things adding up to 4
 production value includes cinematography use of color as symbolism props to represent things
room for improvement
 not a fan of a flash forward or back as a hook for a series
 there were too many charactersplot to fully develop them all also pacing
 misleading trailer it felt that a different character is the main lead instead of a character people were led to believe
 tricking the audience not a fan of how that was done
 sweet moments that didnt actually happen
 cliched plot stuff
 no reason why a character had a girlfriend i couldnt support a romance because it was built to not be a romance
 cringey guitar playingserenading
 many scenes were too dark to see the actors faces or even what was happening even for scenes at night they need to put light on their faces
 nonsense stuff i cant comment on all of the medical things and their realism but i highly doubt any surgeon would spin his medical implements beforeduring a surgery that seemed to be a ton of papers for a small clipboard in ep 1 an investigator who didnt wear gloves at a crime scene in ep 4 a character oddly didnt wear a mask when he should have
 be on cloud decided to sell it to a company where it is only airing in 8 countries and perhaps 2 more and then had the gall to not respond anywhere to questions about the remaining 180 countries but instead posted about how to only watch it via official channels i dont mind companies needing money to get things made but they should have been clear about where and the why update after 5 weeks they had an actual international release and the reason was likely moneymaybe they couldnt say their whole release plan due to a contract but it still was bad to not have an official platform for 180 countries for 5 weeks
note about an actors age i didnt take off points for this but as an fyi 1 actor was likely 17 when he filmed several very explicit scenes age of majority in thailand is 20
 its valid to feel uncomfortable with a 17 year old actor doing explicit scenes and to not watch this series
 its valid to feel fine with a 17 year old actor who voluntarily agreed to do explicit scenes and had his parents permission and watchenjoy this series
 everyone gets to make that decision for themselves i hold no judgement either way for this example personally i am watching the series but im not rewatching that actors nc scenes

this drama owns me child support
see now this is why you should always throw salt over your shoulder whenever you see a black cat i blame whoever gave tonkla that cat also dafug was up with that finale bombastic sideeye
that being said whoever choose to end the series with that kinnporsche song should be beaten and left in disneyland on their birthday dafug the moment that song played i was pulled out of this series and into kinnporsche reminiscing about that instead of going through the motions of this drama that decision was just the worst
anyway this show was a series of me going dafug is going on where are we peoples who is driving this thing i am confusion what universetimeline are we in and whats up with tonkla always wanting it raw banana no wrapper i don tire i am going to sleep
see at first i was like now how we gonna explain that unholy first episode couch scene to our ancestors on judgement day cuz most of yall going to hell for using that replay button  but after episode 4 i was screaming forgive me father for i have sinned lord have mercy what is be on cloud doing to us sir sirs this is a drive thru
no but how the eff am i supposed to function in the society as a calm human after being exposed to all that butt and sounds and wins junk and tymes stroke game these people have no respect for our mental health whatsoever and frankly i respect that xd
listen imma need everyone who worked on this to give me child support and like two weeks worth of therapy cuz im pretty sure you can get pregnant from watching this trust me you can im a doctor i got my certificate from temu the same place the doctors in this show must have gotten theirs no but seriously did these people go to med school or am i tripping tyme tying his own robe after cleaning his hands that one doctor telling great where to find tyme while he was having an operation huh then they made tyme a professional doctor lmao good luck to his patients i guess
plot
this show had me convinced me and my two remaining brain cells had the same iq as einstein which was saying something cuz on a good day i can barely remember how to tie my shoelace no but i went through so many theories in my head was this a flashpoint sort of situation a continuum or a parallel universe episode 4 had me in a chokehold headshots backshots alternative universe i felt so lost but also so intrigued with million questions i was still picking my jaw from the floor two days later
then then after all that this was the ending we got literally how this drama feels like a very delicious bag of caramel popcorn i enjoyed only for the last piece to taste like burnt sugar like a perfect delicious fivecourse meal ruined by a tasteless creme brle
that ending was not it it was such a buzzkill
1 were korn and tonkla that in love we met them as secret lovers sure they seemed in love in the flashback but they both cheated and functioned without each other korn was ready to take great and disappear and didnt even fight tonkla when he threw his sorry arse out plus he only ever seem to remember him when hes his last resort so how in the world would they take the until we meet again romeo and juliet way out im just gonna comfort myself by saying he didnt want to go to jail cuz like aint no effing way
2 so if great and that woman got this 4minutes thing by going to that art show how did tyme get it
3 how did that dean doctor knew that tyme was living in 4minutes timeline and shouted for him to come out
4 great turned himself in for helping dome did he do the same for leaving that woman in the beginning to die when he drove off from my understanding hell get no prison time cuz reasons also what happened to that woman he drove over wasnt she doing some dark curses stuff did the writers forget that plot
5 so greats parent are going to jail or fled the country
6 so win couldnt do anything to stop korn huh
7 do they really expect us to believe tonkla who was going around killing people for revenge and killing using win so hed do him raw will jump in front of a bullet for him i doubt he did it for korn cuz he knew great was korns brother and how hurt he would be if he killed great and he still attempted that so why the eff did he suddenly jump between them
7 literally what the eff was up with that ending even their happy ending felt flat
sure with 8 episode they were limited but the explanation to that whole 4minutes thing was all over the place seems like everyone and their mama could get this 4minutes thing the bad guy was taken care of behind the scenes and have a loving daughter his parent fled but hes working to get them caught the finale felt rushed and not in a good way and the worst part was choosing to end this series on a kinnporsche song so out of place and such a buzzkill
anyway good plot some holes that needed filling rushed ending but it made me think and it was fun coming up with theories so i enjoyed the show nonetheless
characters
this show had a great cast who knew what they were doing i came in expecting tymegreat but tonkla somehow stole the show in the first episodes literally he shot the main lead and i was like oh it was you its alright baby run before they catch you drink some water you must be tired carrying that heavy weapon
also this show was having a buy one get four free special on red flags tyme was a code red of course so was great korn tonkla win and basically every character on the show it was like they were allergic to being nice people which of course made for a good show cuz although i was cheering for some of them i was prepared to accept whatever ending they got happy or sad
bible and jes did great as leads glad i wasnt one of those delulus who acted like someone stepped on their grandmothers toes when they were paired i liked great bible played him very well both when he was acting nice and when his real character came out i found him so interesting as a morally grey character he was neither good nor bad just seemed to be living and doing things that mostly benefited him tyme was more dark than grey cuz some of the decision he made were very very questionable i would not trust him to be my doctor if he was the only one available in the er ill probably go in with a headache and come back with tetanus or something
im not sure how i feel that they ended up together but im glad they have each other great has at least one family now but then again perhaps they deserve to end up together i mean great choose tyme over his brother in both timelines when hed literally just attempted to knife him also killed his mother off in his fake world and tyme recorded their intercourse and posted it all over the internet and great still gave him those poppy eyes so love amirite such sweet nonsense
speaking of raw tonkla boy damn this is literally him in every episode
men whats your favourite colour
tonkla triangles so you wanna do me raw
durex condom has entered the chat productplacement
homeboy was such a wreck
 his dad was a bum who he straight up shoved down the stairs and murdered
 his cat dead then turned into an evil cat who meowed him into committing murders invest in salt people
 his boyfriend kept him a secret then he cheated on him and attempted to kill his brother that confession scene though my boy was like yeah i did stuff so what what is yous gonna do huh
 his brother got his head smashed in and died im still wondering how he heard his brother calling him was he also in the 4minutes just how many people were messing with the timeline probably why theres always so much traffic 
 he got shot and killed while trying to save the policeman hed be effingcheating with causing his secret exboyfriend to blow his head and die with him literally are people ever that in love or am i feeling this whole love thing wrong
anyway tonkla had a lot of problems like damn sharon leave some of the struggle for the other characters he was so on but his character was very interesting i liked him and he was carrying the show the first 4 episode his back must have been constantly hurting though carrying his role and taking those backshotsfine ill see myself out
win used this police statues to get some bedroom action which made him no better than the rest when he said he wanted to move in with tonkla i was like what why dude justthen in the end he was acting all hurt like how did you think this was gonna end seriously though wins dingdong was really just out therelikei saw it right im not delulu and blind am i just tripping
anyway this show was doing too much and not enough at the same time there were a lot of nc scenes and side stories that it took so long for us to understand the plot well im still not sure i fully understand it all 8 episodes was not enough for this sort of plotline to be properly executed to perfection if they had more time im sure this would have been great instead of just good i wish we had more episodes to flash out the storyline
so yeah good show great cast but the it felt rushed and the ending didnt live up to the hype ill recommend it though cuz its a very enjoyable drama and would have you pulling your hair in the episodes where nothing made sense im gonna add this to my most fav dramas of the year along with unknown my standin meet you at the blossom and century of love
im looking forward to the casts next work they were a joy to watch
script and quality
bl of the year until now 
i think bl delivered everything and more in this first episode we had quality and a production of another level which was already expected the cast of millions and the perfect performance from everyone
i loved the effect when the bible went backwards in time 4 minutes and still managed to run over the woman anyway but it was destiny
we as blzeiros won a lot today because this work is incredible and only increases the level of bls as the next ones can become if they have quality and a good production
looking forward to knowing what will happen in the next episodes because this series promises to deliver everything and more stay tuned

great tyme continuum
hello im great no i dont mean im doing great have you seen the show but that i am great ummm no im not saying im a great person have you seen the show but my name is great oh i give up im the crazy cat lady happy
anyway what did you make of me and my story wasnt it fun admittedly it isnt fun to die tyme and tyme again for your entertainment but you knew i was going to live didnt you
im grateful to my creators for putting me in one of the greatest bodies out there on whose head not a strand is out of place and whose body adonis and antinous would envy they also seem to have had a big budget which they mostly spent on interior design porn and renting cars from the fast and the bicurious outlet mall i have no objections i do wish the writers had been paid more because i really dont understand who i am and what has been happening to me i also didnt know how to feel about what was happening but fortunately the background music was always at hand to tell me
since im now alive  im not sure this might be a black mirror kind of situation  i have been lurking around the forums online to find out the truth ive pretty impressed by the hard work of the fandom there are some good theories out there but im still not sure i understand im a bit thick you see but thickness like size matters
ignore the following three paragraphs if pressed for time or to avoid plot details 
what im most confused about is perspective so when i was going into cardiac arrest  as were tyme and tonkla and everyone else whos ever been shot it would seem  i had four comatose minutes during which i could see four  consequential moments where i could have chosen a less evil path fun i love guilttripping some including my maker sammon argue that each of these moments is a pathway to an alternate reality but my physicist friend assures me that this is not how the manyuniverse theory works there reality splits every measurable moment because quantum decoupling happens every measurable moment besides neither the heart nor the brain are quantum systems but never mind also can an unconscious person see or hear or feel isnt that an oxymoron i for one certainly dont remember any of it before you accuse me of being pedantic know that sammon prides herself on her scientific and philosophical sophistication but the most existential question for me is this once we do enter this liminal space and choose an alternate reality what happens to the reality we leave behind do i die am i dead am i bruce willis in that movie
now there is also that whole other storyline involving online gambling tonkla korn win and nan i know you didnt care for any of it but bear with me did i see that too did tyme or were their storylines alone real all the time are my parents good or bad if good why did i see what i did if bad why did tyme see what he did fine lets allow that my perspective and that of an omniscient narrator can coexist but then didnt tonklas dead brother show up at one random point more confusingly if the four minutes represent opportunities where deaths could have been prevented didnt other deaths happen anyway are some lives more worth than others i mean i know my beautiful body is worth more than tymes grandmothers life or that bastard tonklas but still am i the asshole or is the universe fatalistic all the same and our subjunctive possibilities mere hallucinations if so whats the fucking point of all this
of course tyme is still in a huff about the fact that his perspective got half a measly episode but mine got six poor tonkla he fared even worse while were at it what in crazy cat ladys name was that last episode all about im so confused and i dont know why my creators were in such a hurry to wrap things up i dont even understand why im still alive and why tymes still alive but not my brother why did he have to kill himself dont we all have blood on our hands also who chooses these realities for us sammon if so why choose these and not one in which my story actually makes sense as i said the writers should have been paid more if they were paid at all but then all those cute moments between me and tyme  it satisfied you lot didnt it how many of you screamed at the last shot good im happy for you im happy for us too not for my brother though
 here endeth knowledge 
i know some of you thought my sex scenes with tyme were a tad on the soft side listen i know my body and the fact that i was listening to limp bizkit all of next day is no coincidence tyme is a great lover and he bore his arse out for you be greatful but i will admit that bastard tonkla stole the show from me never trust a power bottom were you really surprised when he shot me and revealed his face in the campest way possible id say im glad hes dead but id still love to have had a great tyme with him and win and korn and yes of course id have sex with my murderer if hes hot enough  ask any selfrespecting gay man besides you all saw a flash of jjays pjj didnt you how many times did you go back freeze the frame and thought to yourself ive become my mother
oh one last thing why 4 minutes you ask it is apparently the length of time it would take for consciousness to fade after the heart stops during which you can enter an alternate dimension alternate reality alternate universe or whatever else is alternate thats what the lastminute narrator  where the fuck did she come from  says turns out not possible anoxia induces loss of consciousness in 6 seconds and inflicts permanent brain damage within 2 minutes you should have seen the first draft of this review there are parts of my brain to which i no longer have any access so i can only guess that my creators were listening to madonna on repeat on spotify as they fell asleep or while doing cocaine and concluded with mr timberlake there were only 4 minutes left to save the world
readers digest
do say in search of lost tyme
dont say the great catsby
the masterpeice
if german has dark
if america has breaking bad
if korea has mouse
if spain has the invisible guest
then thailand has 4 minutes the masterpeice 
this is not only the best bl but also the best series from thailand and one of the bests from asia in my opnion 
people hating on this and saying it is only sx should better go and watch their nonsense cringy bls with the story they they may haved watched it in more than 100 shows 
the sx scenes were the best ever seen in a bl drama not even westerns can make a scene like this 
picking up shredded paper
i never want to watch a show where im completely lost episode to episode again this was just some pretty faces slapped under very overwhelmingly underwhelming 8 weeks im not the brightest sunflower in the field but ive never squinted my eyes and had a frown an entire tv show in a while
i only enjoyed a handful of things like the visuals colors and scenes were on point to every second every scene was a desktop wallpaper
now unfortunately i will have to say something quite controversial tonkla carried his story might be extreme and to be fair i dont even know if dome is actually alive because i was under the impression we were watching three different timelines an altered timeline the truth and the desire timeline idk maybe im too slow so does dome die is all three or what but tonklas story at least had something to look forward to until he was ghosted now i get that people were upset about of course because hes a supporting role and he shouldnt have more screentime then the mains but at least when he was on screen i wasnt falling asleep
im really disappointed in boc though following bible from kinnporshe i thought his next character would mean something strong like vegas was but instead it made me wish i never was roped into this show in the first place
really looking forward to something different especially with bible and possibly jes they were robbed out of a good execution of a story but for now all my tomatoes have been thrown
this review may contain spoilers
once again boc is trying too hard
4 minutes has the exact same problem as dff too much time wasted on elements that feel like nothing at the end and the plot gets dumped and rushed in the last 2 episodes boc is again trying too hard to make something different and artistic without making it enjoyable we know boc can make a good show like kinnporsche and we know sammon can write nice stories that turn into good shows like manner of death maybe the problem is boc and sammon together
in terms of acting the highlight is fuaiz hes constantly the best part of every episode an interesting character played by a good actor bas and bible are good even though bas doesnt have much to do the same can be said about job since his character is basically just there like his girlfriend i believe jes is a good actor that short filmmv he did with bible was great but i didnt really enjoy him as tyme specially toward the second half of the episodes
this series could work as a binge watch but ill not be trying to test that theory
convoluted storytelling romances fall flat
i dont have much confidence that the finale will save this series because it has a lot of problems even outside of the hackneyed way it attempts to do thingstheres a difference between a challenging ambiguous narrative and being needlessly opaqueconvoluted
ive got no reason to actually care about any of the main guys or their relationships partly because of a severe lack of chemistry but mostly because the writing gives me nothing to hold onto hello insta love for the most part people dont act like people they act like props im always excited for ambitious thai bls trying to up the quality but theyve got to find better writers to do it these actors deserve better
edit after final episode you have to automatically dock any thai bl score on this site by 23 points to get something realistic and it still holds true here what in the heck was that hard to tell if bible cant pull off less assertive characters when hes given little to nothing to work with skim through the first episode for the nc scene and pass on the rest
nothing like kinnporsche or even dff
this series was so hyped up for so long and the first couple episodes built up that tension that the finale did not live up to in my opinion if they had more episodes to draw out the multiple storylines then maybe it wouldnt have been so confusing and stilted the concept was there but the execution was severely lacking i think we all needed more time with the main characters to know who they were then given detailed followups for the really complex plot points the finale could have been great but they had to pack so much in that it didnt flow at all

unnecessarily confusing
this is going to piss some people off so if you like the series and have no complaints about it then dont read if you disagree i dont care keep it to yourself itsmy review and my opinion also im going to vent a little with some curses ahead 
all good  perfect
now what the fuck was that 
i binge watched this so it wasnt as confusing to me as  i imagine  to whoever watched it while it was on air and i have to say i still ended up with too many questions unnecessary questions about what was real and wasnt specially for tonklakorn relationship
direction was all over the place making everything confusing story by itself is good even great and acting was on point even with the questionable characters morals and behaviours and sadly thats the only thing i liked about the series also den he was adorable  i love him muah he was the best and i loved his interaction with tyme cougheven more than with greatcough 
what i didnt like was somehow all the characters maybe lol i mean they were written in a weird way the only person i felt sorry for was tyme great not so much
i mean great literally did a hit and run then later they kinda forgot to show his confessing to it irl and just showed his regret in the 4mins i know he is sorry and the lady actually committed suicide by jumping in front of him but how would we know now if she actually wanted to diehuh how this was all in his 4mins which was led by his feelings and regrets
so um lady you died sorry about that ill just imagine you jumped on purpose and then forget all about it ok 
now tonkla revenge logically this part was scifi lmao i mean anyone with evidences just shows them to anyone police is big a joke i mean who in his right mind share sensitive information in the investigation with normal citizens moreover a relative to the dead person bitch please
what i hated the most was the way the direction went specially the part where they intentionally showed the real life for tonklakornwin during greats 4mins confusing af unnecessarily
also the reference that the lady who died was the reason for greats mum death and magically when he let her die he saved his mum but what is the proof you fckers you just put random connections just like that good lord 
lady yes you who i killed a few moments ago hello again now you would have been the reason to kill my mum so i really am relieved you died to save my mum you know completely logical 
you see after everything settles in and i know its just a series and fictional and bla bla bla i just dont like illogical stuff but but i still think the story was amazing needs some polishing but nonetheless
i know my review doesnt show that seriously the story was amazing it could have been much much better cinematography was fantastic but sadly that doesnt help much when the final product is full of flaws

4 minutes
i will keep it short simply because i just couldnt get into the story at times i was lost but did carry on watching the whole series the acting was good the script was ok but the mls only my opinion didnt connect for me yes the sex scenes were there in all there glory tonkla and korns sex scene at the beginning was well acted but after that we didnt see them till much later as korn was playing the field so that turned me right off him great and tyme were the other mls but nothing really happened between them that stood out series could have been a lot better there were to many storylines to follow for me and at times was a frustrating watch
well worth watching to make your own take on the series as to some it was great series
result of the combination of good script acting and staging first update from the original review
in manner of death triage dead friend forever  dff make a wish and bite me the famous thai screenwriter isaree siriwankulthon sammon reiterates her interest in witnessing the suspense the alteration of the time time loop medicalforensic work hospital environment police investigation kidnapping murder slowburn romance friendship family relationships school and university ecosystem unjustly accused characters action political police and business corruption always having homosexual characters as protagonists
for her part director and screenwriter ning bhanbhassa dhubthien has demonstrated through the series kinnporsche 2022 and the film man suang that both film and television language constitute a tool that she can also use at her own discretion taste and in which incidentally you have the possibility of continuing working with your most recurring motifs or thematic interests
in 4minutes the series in which sammon and ning join forces for the first time the actions of the peculiar creatures that populate the creative universe of the thai author duo remind us of those of some of the protagonists of the aforementioned works bringing us closer to their characters in a very sensitive fluid and ethereal way recording their most banal movements and glances and turning them into revealing moments by transmitting all the intensity of love through tenderness melancholy and an enveloping atmosphere
great its central star is one of the most striking characters to emerge from sammons imagination a university student at the faculty of business administration and son of a rich businessman blessed with a gift that is also a curse since he has the supernatural ability to know what is going to happen in the future 4 minutes in advance always and when it affects him
this power leads him to alter the results of many events while the memory of what happened visits him again and again in his imagination thus the story restarts from the beginning over and over again so the audience will have to pay attention to discover which is reality and which is not
he a piece of character very competently defended by bible wichapas sumettikul kinnporsche in which it could very well be the most significant role of his still young and promising artistic career and thanks to which he unleashes fervor among lovers of the thai dramas especially lgbt themed fans
he knows it and devotes himself with devotion to building it polishing it making it unique to providing it with an empathy that overflows the screen and allows him to put himself in the viewers pocket his acting counterpoint with jes jespipat tilapornputt sassy player 2009  his counterpart in spaceless a short film directed by jatuphong rungrueangdechaphat also in 2024 and which serves as a letter of introduction to the acting couple  seduces and fascinates as do the episodes that make up the drama from its beautiful presentation to the no less admirable farewell
the friendship that develops between great and tyme takes them on a journey of discovery and acceptance that explores male vulnerability however it is not a simple story of a couple of friends succumbing to love that is very seen and would be too predictable
on the other hand 4minutes is a more rounded absorbing and sentimental story about two young people who find themselves involved in an exciting intrigue in which there will be no shortage of industrial espionage murder kidnapping betrayal infidelity unfulfilled promises political and police corruption the proximity of death revenge score settlements martial combats and explicit sexual scenes completely removed from the universe of pornography and that provide absolute meaning to the characters history 
on the other hand 4minutes is a more rounded absorbing and sentimental story about two young people who find themselves involved in a passionate intrigue in which there will be no shortage of industrial espionage murder kidnapping martial combats and explicit sexual scenes  totally removed from the universe of pornography and that provide absolute meaning to the characters story
with this premise the director manages to develop a deep character study investigating the existential motivations and experiences that shape them as individual beings but also as people united by an unbreakable bond likewise it explores complicated relationships social barriers and depicts more than one gay romance while challenging social norms and embracing the power of love acceptance and understanding it is much more than a simple love story
sammon has created a very intelligent script in which the dialogues are the basis of the story through the conversations that great and tyme have two characters emerge like few we have seen the screenwriters prose is almost lyrical and manages to capture the realism and naturalness of their relationship friendly first then romantic the viewer is transported into the story as if he had the two young people in front of him and was asking permission to jump to the other side of the screen at any moment to join the conversation
as great and tyme connect their relationship faces numerous complications great tries to understand what is causing his abnormality and how to escape it while dealing with personal and family problems for his part tyme secretly investigates criminal acts in which greats family may be involved especially his father mother and older brother korn played convincingly by bas asavapatr ponpiboon a character who adds greater complexity to the story
likewise the stories that unite tonkla inspector win dome and title characters played by fuaiz thanawat shinawatra jay patiphan fueangfunuwat mio athens werapatanakul and jet jetsadakorn bundit in that order play an important role in the development of the series
in this sense a chance meeting with great could help tyme try to get closer to the young university student with the intention of penetrating his family circle to carry out his revenge since he blames greats family for the death of his parents all this while trying to save his grandmother from reprisals and fulfilling his duties as a doctor at a large hospital in bangkok
what begins as a game of cat and mouse will end up becoming a journey of no return while great secretly serves tymes interests to get even the boundaries between sexuality and male friendship are continually compromised with both characters drawn to each other
the incredibly talented cast which in addition to the aforementioned actors includes jjay patiphan fueangfunuwat as inspector win fuaiz thanawat shinawatra as tonkla job yosatorn konglikit as den mio athens werapatanakul as dome and jet jetsadakorn bundit as title it adds a touch of depth elegance and authenticity to the series and nails each scene and makes it believable
the plot of the story is woven based on the two axes of coordinates that constitute greats respective relationships with tyme a surgeon whom he knows due to his supernatural ability and the one he has with his powerful family businessmen they will not hesitate to commit the most terrible crimes if these help them get away with their crimes in the competitive business world
the development of dramatic tension will be the result of both vectors which pull great in opposite directions and which will narratively establish the counterweight between two categories of values which will face each other on the stage table and to which he must have a clear and lucid choice for one of the two both at an aesthetic level and in content which we will see trying to be resolved in the treatment of the psychological level and development of the characters
in the photography of pavarisa tadde and ittipong klinchart the exuberant beauty of colors and light of the luxurious surroundings of the great mansion the beautiful city landscapes contrast with the most gloomy and degraded spaces such as those of hospitals also seen as a setting of pain and death the humble house in which tyme lives with his grandmother since his parents died long ago or those in which a corpse frequently appears
in the context of greats environment we also see how both at the level of photography and staging there is this significant disparity the luminosity and brightness in the daytime scenes with the darkest warmest tones from yellowish to almost reddish from inside the house in both he participates in the fiery internal love dynamics in which the protagonist begins to anticipate in the form of a visual fantasy his passion for tyme
the soundtrack by terdsak janpan fits perfectly with the moods of the characters and the tone of each moment the music wonderfully delves into this suffocating mysterious and at some points almost depressive character in which we see greats tortured spirit immersed until he decides to free himself and surrender to his love and resolve the conflicts that surround him
as ive probably already said in some way the main charm of the series comes from the relationship between the two young people who build a very special bond the chemistry between great and tyme is palpable the two transmit tenderness camaraderie and a lot of passion this helps a lot at a certain point in which the protagonists meet like two chess players with a board in between
at the level of content the struggle of opposite poles is manifested in this clash between the protagonists will for healthy fulfillment and the suffocating reality that surrounds them
once again sammon demonstrates his good eye when it comes to finding unexpected narrative angles building a solid network of emotions designing fascinating characters and plots and telling an attractive story while weaving its edges taking his time pampering and caring for the story to give rise to a series that is summarized as one of the best in recent years
4minutes is an emotional and heartfelt proposal that makes us forget that it is not jespipat tilapornputtde the actor who was supposed to play tyme
sadly lacking real story and development
the actors are good i enjoyed the 2nd pairing but the main pair are not for me the series is lacking chemistry and strong story especially when all they do is use nc sex for story that makes no sense it feels like sex is all they want to focus on for lack of acting and story line and plot that does not make sense sadly disappointed feels like characters are one dimensional and typical with lack of growth please focus more on storyline next time instead of their nc moments especially since call their trailers only emphasize on the intimate moments just to try to get fans on board
the cast had less chemistry than bible with his motorbike
when i saw the trailer of this series i hopped on the moving hype train going on full steam just because i was anxious to see bible back on screen
in the end bible did terrific work but thats pretty much it for this series the plot was all over the place every single lick of chemistry was already seen in the trailer and the pacing made this feel like it was 40 episodes instea d of 8
i mean cinematography was nice they made this pretty at parts at least
also why dont you stay shouldve remained in kp
conclusion i wish to see bible paired with someone else and in a noparanormal series
this review may contain spoilers
a visual stunning midnight bl drama with good acting and a decent plot for a midnight drama
virtues
the gorgeous cinematography
jespipat tilapornputt and asavapatr ponpiboons performances are really good
the 4 minutes concept and the near death experiences theme
the mix between the mistakes of the past great wished could fix the raw and messy reality the characters lived and the things that never happened to tyme but wished would have happen all of this three timelines told with the central context of being on the verge of dying
flaws
some events happen out of the blue with a poorly elaborated build up so the development and the characters relationships actions and reactions lack credibility at certain moments of the story special mention to episode 6
some scenes like the one when tonkla has the camera right in front of his face to show hes succumbing to his dark side born from his traumas the one when great and his father argue about the video or the one where tyme comfronts greats father are badly directed and filmed and therefore acted
sammon repeats things shed already used in previous plots without giving these resources proper personality
some sequences feel like being watching a tv spot a beautiful advertisement or a promotional ad for the actors including all that in a series is perfectly fine and common but you must know how to integrate those promotional things in the general story in a proper manner unfortunately here and in thai series in general they just throw the promotional things to ones face which took me out of the story more than once
to sum up 4 minutes is an interesting and enternaining midnight series that is not perfectly written but is still worth watching if youre looking for a decent bl to watch
impossible plot
i did enjoy this and it certainly kept my attention but the plot is deranged each episode i kept hoping that there would be some explanation as to what the hell is going on ok i get the basic idea  there are several timelines taking place simultaneously and we are seeing them from different characters perspectives but no it just gets crazier and crazier
full marks to the very talented cast though
good was waiting for her to be great
i liked the first half of the show and the overall concept it started with on the 4 minutes the first half was intriguing perplexing wonderfully confusing and very enjoyable and i enjoyed the chemistry between what was marketed as the main characters
however there was a shift somewhere that changed the whole dynamic of the show the resolution of the show for me felt no better than the hated it was all a dream it got really slow and focused too many really long scenes some characters in a single episode that you forget that theres other characters in the show i feel they did too much and followed too many characters to address in 8 episodes
maybe because the show only had 8 episodes they fumbled wrapping it up well and left so many loose ends that for me i needed tied
its not cute love
85 stars rounded up the only reasons this isnt a solid 10 stars is there are a lot of little things that bothered me in of plot and relationship dynamics  but the rest of the series was lovely so its ok
i honestly dont want to share too much about this series before you look it  its best enjoyed knowing as little about it as possible however what i will say is the pacing is good the jumpy timeline builds tension and has you at the edge of your seat and that endingbitter and sweet how you feel about it may determine your final rating too
but yeah apart from that
it was a unique story but there was a missed opportunity to really make this an the best story which somehow makes the flaws worse since i get frustrated seeing wasted opportunities

4 minutes before brain dead
for your questions to be answered on what is going on you have to finish it first those who created this drama is a genius they have put the answers to every questions a viewers may have all throughout the drama specially at the end but believe me even though you would realize that you have seen the answer it will still turn out that you do not understand it youll just see that the enemy was killed and the misunderstanding was cleared the main lead got their revenge and the main meads ended up together thats it 
the catchy thing here was the 4 minutes prediction of great  at first i thought it was a fantasy but the first half was just i think imagination of great to foresee what will happen after 4 minutes because on the episode 6 there was no more predictions from him that was shown everything happens the way they should be  and it turns out that the first parts seems a hallucinations only that is being studied by the other doctor that was a friend of ptyme and that the story went into something like it was showing that what really happens in the 4 minutes that the brain still working without an oxygen maybe that was when someone is about to be brain dead that is what i understood about this show
about what has happened with the other characters for me nothing was special about it because i have seen so many crime and plot twists stories like that but it was still great
the drama was a good one not boring and you can really prove to yourself that it was a high quality show and great actors has starred  i mean look at the acting  it was superb binge watchable  for me this is a recommended one  looking forward for more of bibles works he is such a fine man and actor 
more of a scenario building exercise than an actual plot
chemistry
okay so hear me out this has got to be by far the best level of intimacy and bareness ive ever seen in bl so far like i have no clue how theyve got fuaiz to shoot those bare sex scenes when he was barely 18 is still goes all over my head but his level of maturity and acting makes me confident enough that he knows what hes doing and is of legal age
plot
now coming to the plot there were many reminiscence of dff in the plot and by the end of ep 4 i knew its going to take the messier route just as dff took but not as mad but the entire 4minutes thing was really messy to be honest like what were the writers really trying to convey like how the scenario building as we do in urban design  showed how things wouldve been different if characters behaved in a certain way in those 4 minutes or these were mental patients who were living in their own trance struggling to grapple with reality or actually did time travel its seriously a convoluted mess
character development
i loved how every character was shown to be a grey character and shown them in their exact realness with no useless fluffy like we see in typical bl dramas and had managed their own flaws and struggles though there was little character development in most of the characters except korn for that matter yeah just his realisation what he did wrong was enough for me  dff had really good development and plot buildup even though this did try really hard with those mind boggling plot twists but it has lesser of an impact
acting
fuaiz and bas really stole the show to be real honest those two were literally the main characters of the entire show than jess bible themselves like i really didnt care by the ending of the show as to what shit they were upto i was most concerned where the rat of fuaiz is upto  jess is a veteran actor so need not talk much about it and bible really didnt have much to offer
this review may contain spoilers
a lot of 4 minutes that ill never be able to get back
i had decent expectations for this series because of how long it had been in production and its main cast however it fell short the plot ran off halfway and the end had neither rhyme nor reason
4 minutes can be summed up as a bunch of unnecessary deaths at one point i figured it was committed to karmic justice but i was wrong the main characters getting a sort of happy ending is proof that karma and justice lend little to the plot
i admit that the neardeath psychological storyline was brilliant i found it fun to unravel what was real and what was not however the plot and characters were poorly written
spoiler alert 
great was a shit person he was in a hitandrun was complicit to murder helped dispose of a dead body was privy to the unlawful confinement of a female schoolmate let his corrupt parents clean up his messes and watched a girl get shot in the face when he couldve stopped it the only good he ever did was saving tyme  and he did that for himself
tyme was a huge red flag he was portrayed as a victim turned vigilante but his actions show he was as cuddly with crime as his parents were he sought justice based on a few scribbles in his moms journal locked in on the wrong target and served their son some revenge porn to get attention he put his patient a victim of abuse that needed saving in more danger just to gather evidence for his mission
somehow both characters get an angelic halo over their heads after their 4minute experience they go on a couple of dates play judge and jury and make a show of taking responsibility  but its just great admitting his part in domes murder all their other acts of delinquency are swept under the rug
ton kla played by fuaiz was the character i was most curious about but we only got bits and pieces of his life that didnt give much away he was summed up as a serial killer with a kitty ghost friend and a boyfriend who only showed up when he pleased korn choosing to die with ton kla was unexpected but fitting end to a dark romance i guess
the actors who stood out the most in this drama were bas and fuaiz bas was brilliant as korn and i found myself equal parts disgusted at and sorry for this character who was so obsessed with pleasing his father that he lost himself in the process i hope fuaiz gets more ageappropriate roles where he can show his talent beyond what weve seen in dff and 4 minutes
tldr good acting unexpected storyline poor character development disjointed plots not worth a second watch

great wasnt as great as we thought
ufff thank god i dropped this drama by the third episode and then watched it again from the beginning after it ended i understood that i would only be able to fully grasp it if i watched the entire drama in one go
although to be honest there wasnt really any deep science that we couldnt understand in my religion i had already read that after death a persons brain stays alive for 7 minutes and during that time they see everything they did in their entire life or the memories of things they regret
now in this series the concept is just about 4 minutes instead of 7 simply put in the first 5 episodes of the drama we are seeing the guilt and memories of the last 4 minutes of greats lifewhat he did and what he could have changed but didnt in episodes 6 and 7 we see what actually happened in real life that great couldnt change meaning great wasnt as great as we thought by episode 5 and tonkla killed the title and also shot great taking revenge for his brothers murder and the part where tonklas brother who returned home at the end of episode 4 was also greats hallucination because in the last 4 minutes of his memory he tried to save him the scenes related to tonkla korn and win are mostly real not imagined
and in the last episode we are shown tymes last 4 minutes where he wishes that he had met him naturally without any purpose and had only continued their relationship with genuine love
now thats lovekorn even after hearing the truth from tonkla sacrifices himself after tonkla dies and they both die lying in the same position as they did during their first date while talking that was very emotional and then the mini heart attack at the end of the drama hahah overall ive never seen a bl series like this they have played with science very well
dont start this serie if youre not gonna give it 100 of your attention
dont start this serie if youre not gonna give it 100 of your attention and focus on the details this is not just another bl the story telling will either make you hoked or drop the serie but if you give it time everything will fall into place it makes you come up with 100 possible theory of whats going on
the acting was great i loved bible and jess together its totally worth it one of the best original story bl out there
its a 9 for me but
i loved the series the acting was amazing the quality was top tier and the cinematography was beautiful
to me everything was spectacular until the last half of the last episode they rushed everything too much we didnt get to see great waking up we dont know who tortured warit we couldnt see tyme and great reunion after both woke up and other things that were left unanswered
other than that i know many people dont feel the same way but i believe they did a good job with this series of course the start was confusing that was their intention but with every episode we got to understand what was actually going on
finally a story
finally an original idea
finally a concept with a concrete story behind it
finally a series that gives real space to the roles to develop
finally a series that you watch because you are interested in how its story will develop
finally a series whose twists have consistency and explanation
finally a series created by people who didnt get bored of their work
finally a series whose raison dtre is an idea and not an hourlong commercial forced by actors without a script
ps dont get me wrong i high value the attempt of the series to bring something meaningful and new its not perfect in many ways and a lot of things could be fixed but its miles away from the classic boring recipes based only on fan love of specific actors also my perceptiveif you kept the sex part from the whole series thats fine and its perfectly legitimate but thats probably what you were looking for in the series
this review may contain spoilers
lots of potential however
my expectations were very high starting this series and the first episodes lived up to it the actors and the visuals were great pun intendet so no complains on that aspect however i wished they couldve done more episodes and dedicated the story and all its plotlines as well as the romance more time everything happens very fast many plotholes werent filled and the characters lost depth as their development wasnt given enough space specifically greats brother as well as the relationship between him and ton kla great and tyme and the police officer everything was rushed so as watcher i felt myself growing emotionally distant to the story and unbothered when certain characters died
also a bit of more explanation to why some characters acted the way they did wouldve been nice why kill someone randomly the art exhibition ton klas actions in the first few episodes
this review may contain spoilers
wish it was longer
as the title suggests this show would have had a higher rating from me had it been more fleshed out over more episodes imo
things which i liked
1 the elevated overall production value and the care placed in every detail from the cinematography locations characters styling music scoring and of course the directing
2 majority of the cast protrayed their characters convincingly bar jjay and jet in some of their scenes but overall they were decent too
3 i liked that not all characters bar tymes grandma maybe especially the leads are these cliched good spiritedheroic ones in fact most are gray and some are just straight up fcked up lol
4 stand out acting performances especially from bas and fuaiz hope to see each one of them given more roles because i appreciate their talent and performances a lot
5 those cat mascots are adorable i need them
things i didnt like
1 so much build up in the earlier episodes but by the finale many points that were emphasized earlier were left unanswered or attainded to
2personally for me the ending as sad as it was regarding korntonkla made sense and was appropriate given the grave errors both of them commited especially tonkla the ending for tymegreat left a lot to be desired and was borderline nonsensical imo especially given what great commited same point can be applied to greats parents as well
3 unfinishedrushed eplanations for certain characters fates nan sarman that lady that was hit by great etc wish they explained more on them but i guess with just 8 episodes not everything was going to be tackled perfectly
overall it was a nice and a different series that definetly stood out to me in the see of mediocre bl shows this year

great show but the end was rushed
the concept of the show was amazing it kept me guessing til the 6th episode where they explain everything the cinematography was great the actors were good especially the second couple basfuaiz those two completely stole the show with their performance in my opinion
where the show started with a bang i feel like the ending was a bit lacking too much was condensed in the last episode they should have added an additional one
tymes alternative timeline should have been explored longer they should have given more screentime to the main couple relationship outside of the justicepolitical debacle in the real timeline the relationship aspect was a bit neglected
the ending of the second couple was fitting but common  couldnt they give them proper last moments  i would have loved to see a longer version of their own 4 minutes like the main couple they deserved it  i would have loved to see them living happily in the open even if it was fake
all in all the serie was great its outside of the cliched tropes for bl and i hope to see more of those kind of projects
love you bible

disappointed 4 minutes
first off the acting was superb second there was a lot more ass on display than i care for and i am not opposed to nudity when warranted it wasnt but not to say it was done in poor taste i am just not an ass person so it just looked like it was done for shock value than needed scenery if they showed back or abs it would be more pleasant for me but thats just a style choice the director the sex scenes were definitely soft porn it looks like they were really doing it
the chemistry was there for all 3 couple the main couple the second couple the cheating half of the second couple with the officer they really deliver on the sex and kissing that 17 year old actor was not a frigid actor who have qualms about kissing and nudity i know people are mad about him being young and doing it with older actors i dont know about yall but 17 year old boys are full of hormones and a lot have sex at this age women need to stop portraying girls safety issue of rape and pregnancy into gay male norms it stigmatized gay boys with straight girl social norms which is what most of the bl fandom consist of
anyway i am disappointed with this series being in a loop of 3x i dont know if this is an alternate universe series or whatnot but i feel cheated of a good beginning middle and end series i dont know what i expected but this was not it i dont think i had any expectations other than to see a well written series i feel like this series was a screenwriter writing the same idea of a story and the rewrote it 2 times more this was the result as someone who use to write stories this was something did a lot this was very reminiscent of that writing exercise i did in creative writing class
this is why i gave it a low rating in story but high marks for acting in the end i was very disappointed with this series not the actors
hot scenes you dont want to miss
oh i have to say cant forget that bible great and jes tyme are the mains in this 
now on to it i really liked this for the most part the acting was great the sex scenes were oh so nice  lets not forget the chemistry going on with them it was nice to see how great and tyme were with each other how great seem to be flustered and caught offguard by tymes presence even how tyme seemed to be offguard around great a bit to they had a lovely connection it was impossible not to get sucked in them it was so cute how great was around tyme they bith did a great job you saw it all with thier acting
lets not forget tonkla and korn talk about a messed up love yet at the same time a strong love in parts i didnt like korn much though tonjka wasnt much better times even though he was in a crisis still not good to do in the end they were with each other
i liked the concept of this one being able to see 4 minutes in to the future in order to change the out come it seem to even change great in a good way i also liked how tyme believed him and not thinking he was crazy he was willing to help great find out what was happening to him
i do have to say that i got confused in this i dont want to say to much i just want to say the closer it got to the end eps i just got confused even though i did i did like the whole series i just cant rate it as high as i would have liked to because i just had to many questions at the end
good series
i think to watch this series you require a higher iq then mine lol the last 3 or 4 episode was some trippy shit they got me super confuse however the actors performances was immaculate tonkla really needs a psych eval and korn needed to aligned his priorities better furthermore the cinematography was beautiful the venues in which they recorded the colors ugh that was a visual delight
some reviews mentioned that this series was too confusing and i agree it even led me to rewatch episode 6 from the beginning once it started to show different perspectives
however i think thats one of the series strengths i fell in love with how it shifted to an unexpected perspective i couldnt have imagined the way they developed multiple sides to the story made it even more intriguing that said they could have added lukwas perspective so the audience could better understand her relationship with great beyond just sharing symptoms
i have to admit bible and jes are excellent actors actually all of them are fantastic and this is one of the reasons i could finish the series in one sitting
there is one major flaw i should mention i used to work in a hospital and my job was related to surgery so i was really bothered by how easily outsiders accessed the operating room in real life this is nearly impossible especially in a larger hospital like the one shown accessing an or typically requires multiple levels of clearance
aside from that this is a great thai series you shouldnt miss this year
average bl drama that could have been great if executed differently
the drama started with a unique and wellexecuted storyline but became confusing in the second half to be honest i had no idea what was going onwhich storyline was the real one what was happening in the end it all made sense but it was kind of disappointing also they could have done a better job of editing the scenes it is a real shame as the drama started really strong
on the other hand the acting was superb especially the second leads korn and tonkla who stole the show the intimate scenes were 
overall it was an average bl drama that could have been great if executed differently
this review may contain spoilers
the main couple should have been korn and ton kla
4 minutes is okay but it got me so confused of what is really happening that i dont think that the show really worked the story is about this rich kid and a doctor that got entangled in this crazy family drama but it is also about a character named great rich kid who got the ability to see 4 minutes to the future now i will have to say that the premise is good and that the premise is strong we have a good set of characters here and they are put in the story so well that i think they were able to serve their purpose the love story of great and tyme felt more secondary to the story which i wont mind but their love story is not even as interesting as the love story of the secondary couple of the show  korn and ton kla the time travel aspect of the show is where things got a bit trippy and i feel like the execution i confusing the story on its own is pretty good already the story is interesting because we have a strong family drama with the story of ton kla and korn bas as korn is just really good the character had a good character development and we got to see him try both options that he was put in and it is actually sad to see how his character ended because we got such a good portrayal and a good contrast to what is happening to him mentally it must have been hard for him to be in such position where he cannot do so much but had to so many things his relationship with ton kla took a very tragic turn considering that they are both cheating on each other for different reasons but they died together they are in a very sexual relationship and we got to see the naked body of bas in this show and i will never complain i feel like the love story of korn and ton kla had so many good scenes and the story is just more interesting there was a point in the show that i was wishing that they could have been the leads and the show will focus more on their perspective compared to them the love story of great and tyme fails to deliver that and the time changes were just pretty much confusing that everything that happened in the first five episodes were erased in the sixth episode as they go back to the timeline basically what they did is to show how things will actually happen if the four minutes thing will not occur and the way it changed the story is not even that drastic therefore the entire phenomena felt very much unnecessary as the events will all still be the same this is what is disappointing because this just says that everything that we watched so far were erased and that we just wasted our time it is just bad storytelling and writing in the main storyline and i feel like i invested in the wrong story considering how slow things were in the first few episodes and how quick it is for the sixth episode to catch us all up to what happened this is all a miss and i am a bit disappointed i also would have wanted to see more of them together because the interest with their love story never really picked up they have few good scene here and there but they have spent most of their times apart and the romantic relationship was never really or strongly established this is where my dismay is and i feel like the concept that we got introduced to at the beginning really meant nothing to the main story line since we just got to hear it again in the last episodes in a few seconds before the end but other than that there is nothing there the story is basically just 3 episodes long and that is it it could have been so much shorter but this could still be so much better considering that bible and jes have good chemistry when they are together but they failed to use this in the show to its full potential they are also very hot individuals and we got to see it i am thankful for that for the story it could have been handled and executed for so much better
4 minutes that seemed like 8
essentially you must buy into the premise that our physical brain will cease to function after 4 minutes without oxygen this of course is a truism but what this series then does is push forward a premise that during those 4 minutes without oxygen people who are experiencing that trauma relive life in various manners within that 4minute window period for some they can perceive events that will occur 4 minutes in the future why this series is so confusing is that it attempts to project too much story with too many people admittedly i am old and i have a difficult time following a train of thought for one individual and i am pushing it for two people but when you have multiple people affected by the advancement of 4 minutes in the future with a number of different alternatives for each my mind begins to jellify logic becomes inoperative here everything makes sense because nothing actually does it depends upon the time frame you are currently in therefore there is no logic consequently i am lost
i am bemused by criticism of this series from people who state there are too many nc scenes i did not see any so i am not sure what they are talking about for those who read this this is an adult series with an adult theme there is nothing pornographic or even sexually offensive if you find it so then stop watching do not impose your standards on others for that will become a dangerous precedent there are way more obscene subject matters such as infidelity murder suicide illegal gambling bullying abuse and yet we are concerned about a few scenes of two guys laying in bed seminaked incongruent silly and cretinous thinking
this was highly disappointing
i dont even know what to say about this mess of a series i cant believe i waited this long to watch this only to be highly disappointed
first of all the acting is terrible absolutely cringe i expected better of bible because i just adored his character of vegas in kinnporsche but whatever this is was is not it
bible as a bottom isnt working the new partner is very talented but its obvious that hes having to carry bible a good majority of the time and i hate saying that because i really did enjoy bible in kinnporsche
i dont like the new ship either and its not that its any fault of jes because hes a damn good actor but theres no chemistry with bible and jes has always had good chemistry with all of his costars why is it so different with bible i dont know but it isnt working for me
second of all the overwhelming use of nc scenes is disappointing theres no storyline at all and not to mention how unrealistic the sex scenes are totally unrealistic dont even get me started on the full frontal shot its very obvious that the over use of nc scenes were used to draw people in to distract them from the bad acting and no storyline the lack of facial expressions from bible is also concerning i dont know what the hell happened to bible but something is off with him jes my guy please go back to what you were doing before bl isnt for you dude youre too talented for this disaster you shouldnt have to carry someone 247
a mustwatch
i was super excited to see bible work with jes in this show and boy did they deliver this show was absolutely incredible and had me at the edge of my seat every episode a thrilling actionpacked plotline was perfectly partnered with a slowly forming romance between the main leads and side characters that could stand alone in their own series round it out beautifully the only potential issue with this one was that the 18 rating needs to be taken real seriouslyboth with the violence and explicit sex scenes
when great bible hits and kills a woman while driving he suddenly finds himself with a strange ability he is occasionally and not of his own will sent back in time 4 minutes to fix mistakes after preventing the death of this woman she still ends up in the hospital great feeling bad about this goes to visit her and meets dr tyme jes the two slowly get to know each other but it seems their lives are more intertwined than they thought greats familys shady business seems to be willing to go to any lengths to continue their work and tyme seems to be somehow connected to all this meanwhile greats brother korn bas and his boyfriend tonkla fuaiz seem to be more involved in the inner workings of this shady family business which is straining their relationship
i cant begin to describe how incredible this show was the plot twists were incredible and had me sitting in shock at the end of the episodes i cant possibly describe all the interesting plot points that happen without horrible spoilers but it is truly an experience to watch it i love when a plot doesnt only revolve around the romance and this one definitely isnt focused on it but uses the romance to enhance the plot again the explicit scenes in this show were a bit much for me but overall it was fantastic and i would highly recommend it
what can you do in 4minutes
you can listen to why dont you stay by jeff satur
you can watch an episode of back to seventeen
you can drink a thai milk tea
the things that happened in four minutes here though
saying anything would spoil something in essential that would mean i can say nothing about the story
but even this statement is an indicator of how mind bending the plot is it keeps you on your toes makes you come up with theories and youre invested throughout just waiting to get all the answers to the tens and hundreds of questions that will inevitably pop up in your mind
the synopsis is basis enough to go off on at least according to me since that way theres no ideas on what you can expect you can just let the complexity and intrigue of the story surprise you
what you can expect though in addition to the above is great acting nc scenes and brilliant cinematography youll want to rewatch the episodes over and over again to see if you missed any details and with eight episodes its a series you can watch quickly and revisit as many times as you want
so grab your notebooks and pens grab someone to discuss theories with and just go for it if youre not in the mood for something this complex and confusing set it aside and come back to it later because it is so worth it
i loved it
an excellent very interesting series the fantasy aspect is not excessive and the police plot is well handled the pace is good with no lulls youre captivated by the story
sensitive subjects are dealt with without exaggeration corruption mafia murder impunity a welcome change from the constant sensationalism of this kind of story
theres no manicheanism and we know that not everything is black and white another good point
as for the many very explicit sex scenes apart from the first one which i found excessive the others fit the story well the first scene between the 2 heroes is hooootttt
best bl series of 2024
this review may contain spoilers
definitely worth watching plus very original concept
im so surprised the main couple got a happy ending here or more like that none of them died and that it wasnt just 4 minutes imagination and the series didnt end like dff where i absolutely hated the way it ended it was really great and interesting to see a series where a popular bl pairing was separated jjayfuaiz nailed their roles and though they didnt end up together and most probably wouldnt even if tonkla didnt die i really loved their story it was really sad but actually realistic they were true lovers to enemies and thats how the story should end its also good to know that in the end tonkla and korn still loved each other and korn died with him its probably better for him after the shits he went through for his father even separated from tonkla to save his family business and he deserved peace in the end
i really love the way this story was written and that they showed us that some criminals can really change their perspective and want to redeem in the end great was really well written and was lucky enough that tyme loved him too much to leave him and also that he got the chance to live a much better life

setting the standards for bl
this show is soo good it feels illegal to even write a review of it like i dont want to spoil the thrill for others watching it for the first time
this show has made me rethink my ratings for the series that i have previously rated higher so i give this series a 10010
there were some minor loopholes offcourse but despite that i would still say for a thriller mystery romanceif it was this show is a trendsetter for bls
so i will rather keep it short
why to watch this series
1 storytelling might seem confusing but it makes up for it in the end and that is the reason what makes you soo engaged to the series as youll have a lot of questions
2 beautiful top quality cinematography
4 amazing acting from the whole cast
5 cgi and visual effects done right
6 unique storyline and engaging plot
7 flawed and complex characters
8 nc scenes were realistic and didnt feel cringe or fake
improvement points
series should have been atleast 1012 episodes rather than 8 episodes to explore the main characters more
oscar winning series
woowo  mindblowing masterpiece i didnt expect to see such solid and intresting plot from thai bl industry this is specially for time travel lovers i like the was they played with timelines and in last the wrapped up everything perfectly no loophole whole 4 minute concept was perfectly explained in whole series their is 3 timeline in which 2 timelines are virtual fake world 
in last 10 min of ep 8 it was explained why and what 4 min actually is
and
spoiler pls remember everything that happens with kla and korn is reality they just used 4 min concept for thyme and great 
and just focus on each and every single details  cardiac arrest 
one of the best
series was good and wellmade for me
story was different and new
i watched each episode several times
actores was wonderful and i liked the chemistry between jess and bible they look good together
i liked the series but i wish episodes were longer

a well scripted thriller with intriguing characters
a captivating journey through time and love  a final review of 4 minutes
after watching all eight episodes of thailands 4 minutes i can confidently say this series has been a compelling roller coaster of emotions mystery and passion what started as an intriguing premise quickly transformed into a layered narrative that kept me glued to the screen each episode unraveled new dimensions of time relationships and personal growth making it one of the most thoughtprovoking bl series ive watched
a love story rooted in time
great and tymes chemistry started to develop by episodes 3 and 4 pushing their love story to unprecedented emotional heights great who has the extraordinary capacity to see four minutes into the future begins to realize how this ability impacts not just his life but also his relationships with people in general and tyme in particular greats fragility is progressively revealed by the plot especially when he confides in tyme about the dreams he has of him which is a precursor to the love tension that will develop throughout the episodes

psammon thank you for humbling me
let me be honest with you i was a bit cocky as i expecting everything will happen from ep 1 to ep 5 and the majority of my expectations were true except of one major thing up until that point i was gonna give this drama 7 or 75 as its a drama were you can predict everything will happen
then i watch ep 6 i gasped it was like a slap in my face telling me respect psammon
from ep 6 to the final the rating was going up until 85
this drama you can predict and unpredict whats gonna happen give it a shot
a good story well narrated
this was actually a good thriller a good story well narrated a smart film probably not meant for everyone
i liked the freshness of the narrative thats because i couldnt predict the next things to come which i found refreshing at some point i thought they were mocking my brains because some twist of events seemed illogical but in the next episode it became clear that the apparent nonsense wasnt a nonsense at all i had a burning question for an episode or two but afterward i understood that the explanation was there all the time it appears that i was somewhat misled by the rapid pace and intensity of the show and mistaken that explanation for hints i also liked the attention given to the details the symbolism used throughout the entire series the fact that everything was well thought welldesigned the logic was flawless and everything fell into place in terms of logical deduction to me it almost felt like the filmmakers were mathematicians d d
the acting was very good and the direction was superb
having included vivaldi in the ost tracks automatically grants a 10 mark from me but generally speaking the music was good wellchosen and wellmatched to the scenes also it doesnt have too much of it so its not redundant or annoying
i will definitely watch this show again because im sure ill notice details that i missed the first time
amazing show
amazing show seriously if you have short attention span this show is going to mess with your head me personally i enjoy this kind of genre and actually understood everything once this series wrapped its ending the fact that they dont even give us a preview for next episode was kinda thrilling once a week per episode also gave me enough time to go to reddit or tumblr to indulge with others discussing about each episode about what we viewers couldve missed what could happen next and what to expect some theory were a spot on and some were not 
cinematography chefs kiss the camera work was amazing i even follow their cinematographer on ig just to follow through whats his next projects going to be
actors also amazing they delivered every scene so well even the supporting actors are amazing
writers and directors both are woman and they are doing a splendid job with 4minutes all the crews behind the scenes also seem so chill and they know what are they doing so very professional
anyway im giving it a perfect score
4 minutes is definitely a mustwatch
to begin with lets respect and show support for these actors who participated in these nc scenes its not easy for anyone to do it especially if its their first time while some dramas use nc scenes to compensate for the plot 4 minutes does not do that at all the nc scenes complimentcoincide with the drama as a whole the plot the acting the chemistry are all amazing i definitely recommend watching this series if you havent yet this show displays perfectly the difference between real and ideal what would you do if you knew what was going to happen would your actions truly lead to a good end even if you tried your best to do what was right was it really the correct choice in the end
whatever you do you cant change what is destined to happen
a story of a lost soul who tries to make things right in the present after being in the future for 4 minutes 
it had a grand start filled with thrills naked white butts and lots of anticipation of great content another bl with a time travel theme got me interested in watching it was going very well i understood what was going on and created a link in my mind but soon after episode 4 things started going downhill i lost track of what was going on and totally got confused with the storyline if i were to name a drama as a showoff then this is the shinning example of it wait this is literally synonymous to boc now
even though i understood what was happening at the last 4 minutes of ep 8 in general the story feels like a fever dream where you feel like you understand the situation but still cant figure out what and why that is happening and after waking up you completely forgot what it was all about the storyline is so erratic that i lost interest in the middle there were different storylines and they wanted to give attention to every one of them but while doing that they lost the actual significance of the show maybe its not that complicated but sure it is confusing still i watched it because i wanted to reach the conclusion so i cant really point out what i liked or disliked as i feel like im in a daze to conclude anything 
it had a big budget great artists and beautiful and aesthetic cinematography but it fell short in terms of storytelling and binding the whole thing together again it is proved that boc failed to deliver a compelling story and tried to hide it with nc scenes and handsome faces i had high expectations but now im utterly disappointed i cant rate this show high just because of its high content value i do enjoy the complicated storylines but i cant lose my brain cells over 8 episodes of content maybe im too dumb for this its not for me
sammon strikes again
another perfect story from sammon kudos to bible perfect as always and jes a pleasant discovery for me a complicated and gripping plot that keeps you in suspense and in doubt until the last minute all the actors perfect in their roles and beyond expectations fuaiz and jes im already on my third rewatch
great concept weak plots
its an interesting supernatural idea that limits the power to see the future in the span of 4 minutes only but with a plot that should make the audience in awe but diverted to having a messy ending this is another typical be on clouds project that only showcases a highquality start with an extremely disappointing finale i understand that the script is trying to give us shocking revelations but the execution was poorly done if they had enhanced most of their scenes during the last two episodes everything about this drama would have been a chefs kiss
i highly appreciate and am welldevoured by bas extremely outstanding performance as korn in this series he stole the show and uplifted the dramas charisma the presentation of his role was flawless the love triangle of korn tonkla and inspector win is way more entertaining than the main couple they nailed their characters and stole the spotlight even playing as supporting casts but i must say that bas and bibles chemistry as siblings is so cute that i want to see more of them as sworn brothers in the future
the intimate scenes are also the best it was tremendously romantic and amorous fuaiz and bas made the finest sequence of passionate acts in the show jj became the third wheel here and i liked it better since the two mentioned paired above were explicit and intense
in general 4minutes is a pretty average bl drama with a fascinating start that loses its spark from the dissatisfying scenarios established in the end nevertheless the acting from everyone was great and set up a unique storyline that distinguished them from other bls from this year nice work
highly original mindbending watch
4 minutes is perplexing every time you think youve worked out where the narrative is headed it swerves in a different direction the synopsis makes the series seem like a get a glimpse into the future and change your destiny plot but its far more complex than that
the journey itself is enjoyable rather than nauseating instead of predictable buildups into scenes which are clearly designated as payoffs the story is delightfully fragmented and slippery its not entirely clear which sequences took place when so it requires some mental gymnastics to untangle everything and come to your own conclusions
beoncloud has its way with creating such dark and complex characters sometimes with sinister motivations in any case i liked the deeper message driving the show at the end of our lives we will always look back on our regrets and wish that we did things differently all so that the remaining moments of our life arent spent being weighed down by our conscience
while humans are capable of making some pretty awful decisions 4 minutes also reminds us that we can choose otherwise there is always a choice

the series that kept me on my toes
this is the kind of bl content i want with both thrilling plotting and sweetness  i loved how each moment had its own uniqueness to it and while haveing a magical element it was quite realistic  but what stole the show for me was the acting every actor really killed i really love how unique evert boc storyline is like they dont follow the normal pattern of bl story and give it there own twist which actually makes it more entertaining and fun especially with this one the most fun part for me was how each ep gave you answer and question both keeping me guessing what was happening and just to add i really love how the time actually did focus on other characters and there own stories rather then it connecting it all it was more intersecting which made it more fun 
not a bl more like a mystery
this was a wild ride every episode raised more questions without answering any until the last episode i had so many theories which all turned out to be false
some may disagree but i found that the ending very much made sense and they honestly werent any big questions left unanswered
the characters felt like real people not good people but people expect for title he is just plain evil and the acting was amazing i watched this series because of bible and he didnt disappoint
what i didnt like when i watched it i tried to remember all the little details and hints like the backstory of a side character that could be important in the end only for them to never be mentioned again or explained that made some scenes feel random otherwise it would have been a masterpiece
but so you know i wouldnt really call this a bl because its not a romance the mystery and scifi aspects are the main focus it was kind of similar to manner of death or to some mafia bl in terms of the vibe dont expect the typical fluffy bl story this is not it the relationships werent very well developed either but maybe thats realistic
i used to think that like love was explicit but in comparison to the sultry version of 4minutes like love is the most family friendly bl ever honestly it was a little bit to explicit for my taste its like i am invading the characters privacy lol if you always wanted more explicit and more realistic damn nc scenes this is the show for you
should you watch it yes if you want a series which plot seems to be a mystery until the last episode or just a mystery scifi series with gay characters you should
im just here to troll the haters
this 10 star rating is dedicated to those fake ass profiles who set aside a part of their precious time just to create a new account to give this 1 star rating after the first episode 
hope u all continue to waste ur time hating on this 
all my love to u hardworkerskeep carrying on 
havent finished yet but already know i will rewatch
im really hopeful that next few episodes will be as good as the ones ive seen already  one of the best bl series ive seen amazing and shocking plot keeping me focused and intrested i havent skipped one bit  thats how you know i enjoy something im really impressed by skills of the actor who plays tonkla  hes a few years younger than me and i can tell theres a bright future before him
good one go watch it fully recommended
overall the screenplay was outstanding with a storyline that gave every character ample space and equal importance while im typically not a fan of nc scenes in first ep but i must admit that the one in the first episode was executed brilliantlythey truly nailed it i also liked the way bible traveled 14 minutes backward in time for the first time it was amazing after watching the first episode im thoroughly hooked and fully intend to support this series it boasts exceptional cinematography and stellar performances from an amazing cast
this review may contain spoilers
a bl beyond the typical romance trope
its a bl that seeks an audience willing to engage with the complexity of the plot who doesnt mind being left with questions
the heartbreaking 4minutes concept
great desperately trying to change the past  fix his mistakes
korn longing to escape his old life  run away with tonkla
tyme yearning for a fulfilling past with great
it leaves a powerful message live your life fully dont leave things unresolved fix the things you can and never leave words unsaid with those you love
a freaking masterpiece
be on cloud has done it again this was honestly a joy to watch i went in not expecting much but it truly exceeded my expectations
the cast in this was fantastic the leads chemistry were just unmatched including the side characters too
honestly a gorgeous gorgeous storytelling  cinematography literally had me gripped at the edge of my seat from episode 1 till the end i genuinely didnt want it to end
saying that i shouldnt have been so surprised at how good this was considering its a be on cloud production definitely on my top 3 favourite watch this year and i definitely need to check out more of their work

my take on the plot
this show really stands out not just within the bl genre but among dramas in general what makes it special is how it keeps things engaging without relying on complicated plot twists or creating unnecessary plot holes the way the story explores themes like redemption and how our past decisions shape our future is handled in a creative and unique way
the main character great gets the chance to redeem his past mistakes during a 4minute window while hes unconscious whats interesting is how he gets to relive these 4 minutes over and over almost like a dream where time stretches and feels longer than it actually is the show does a great job balancing between reality and subconscious experiences and it never becomes confusing its smooth and keeps you hooked throughout
there was one part where i was initially disappointedwhen great meets a female character at an art exhibit at first it felt like the show was becoming too unrealistic but then it all made sense as the scene was revealed to be more of a metaphor however there was a bit of confusion with why only some characters like great got the chance to relive moments while others didnt it left me wondering if certain scenes were real or just symbolic plus the subplot with tonkla being able to see ghosts could have been explained betterit felt a bit unclear
the shows message about making the right choices and being a good person even if it doesnt change the past really hit home great and thymes characters both changed after the 4 minute phase and they were making good decisions even though it might not change the overall life experiences and korns 4minute were he chose to live his life with the one he likes was so emotional that made me cry
the acting especially from the four main leads was fantastic their chemistry felt real and they delivered on the emotional weight of the story the focus wasnt entirely on the romance between the main couple instead it explored their broader life experiences meanwhile the second lead couples storyline was more focused on love and their tragic ending was really moving korns story in particular was heartbreaking and beautifully acted the scene where tonkla gets shot and korn didnt know what to do was one of the most powerful moments
id give the story a solid 1010 not just compared to other bl series but even against nonbl dramas i noticed some people gave it lower ratings and i think its because they didnt fully understand the deeper message of the show as for the acting its a 1010 though some side characters werent as strong the music also worked well earning a 910 from me but the guitar scenes felt a bit forced they couldve been better if they had been integrated more naturally into the story

perfectly delivered compelling plots and actorswho are spectacular at conveying their characters emotionswith top notch chinematigraphy  breathtaking visuals meticulous scriptevery single details was deeply portrayed if anyone loves new things this story is enough to drag them into their world the vibe of german web series darkwas the first thing that caught my attentionthey uses reference from inception 20210as my preference is suspense psychological elements thriller and dark mystery in every part of fiction then 4 minutes is definitely for those people like me im stunned to see adding my favourites in my favourite bl its a overwhelming happiness that cant be described no repeating plot points and detours through side stories that do not pertain to the main plot the story revolves around 4 minutes that is explained with proper term  every coin has two sides so the negative point of this series for me was nc scenesi skipped most of them and that wasnt my concern anyway i repeat its the only negative point to me but no one cant deny the fact that those ncs were better than western also to sum up boc always keeps international level so definitely they will put some international quality in nc scenes they didnt even sell it to another company thats what calls professionalism
to those who are stuck with anything and lost the ability to accept good things should stay away from this series
to sum up if youre not ready to explore please stay away no need to hate or spread negativity when you already know it isnt your type or something you have option to not watch dont ruin thier hard work and effort unreasonably
one of the bl series of 2024
i think we all know that bibles acting is top notch thats we have been waiting for him since the end of kin porsche apart from everyone did a awesome job main lead  bible and jes have awesome chemistry but the side couple chemistry is good but its problematic also as the actor whos playing tonkla is underaged hes barely 18 rn i think be on cloud entertainment should do something with casting barely 18 if they cast they shouldnt give them 18 scenes so its the only thing which was a little bit draw back to me but apart from this its a really awesome series to everyone did a amazing job special shoutout to the aesthetic its awesome 
confusing plot bad chemistry bad acting too much nc scene
confusing plot bad chemistry bad acting too much nc scene
up until this momment i write this review there is no one that really explain to me what is the 4minutes plot i guess not all people get the storyline its look like the title 4 minutes its not match with the storyline everything doesnt make any sense
the main couple face too look a like both look like brother than a lover so its very hard to imagining them together as a lover the chemistry is 0 their nc scene is meh for me not adding any plot and no chemistry at all the main couple storyline is too force flat and blend no dinamic after all i dont like it at all

nc on the first episode doesnt feel right for me i lost interest right away i couldnt continue and focus on their acting because all i could remember was them banging each other why is it that the bl nowadays is just focusing on nc cant we have a series with a meaningful story actors facial expression is so nonchalant i dont know ill try again the next episode but i hope i wont end up dropping it

complex
i always see a lot of people complaining that the story isnt there or theres only nc scenes but thats not true in the slightest if youre confused about the story then youre not paying attention the nc scenes are absolutely necessary because they speak a lot about the characters sure you could say tonkla is some sex crazed guy but those scenes show his desperation for intimacy and love i think the wintonkla storyline is the only thing keeping me from dropping the show i find tonkla so interesting  i absolutely love win greattyme are good too im just not one for the timetravelling plots so their story doesnt really connect with me that much
none of that is to mention how absolutely fucking incredible all of the actors are bible jes fuiaz jjay and the others have smashed it so far im excited to see if the ending is as  as everyone is predicting
the most stupidest thing ive ever seen this year they might as well just cancel the show cuz nc on the first episode with insanely stupid cgi yeah that did it for me i aint going back there cant believe they made people wait a whole year for this crap damn i wasnt expecting it at all we should have at least read the signs it would have been so much better if they would have focused on the story and wait for the plot to build up before adding any type of nc in it like even the scenes the sexual scenes it was way too far gone and one of the actors being like younger way younger its an ich for me
horny girls will love it i bet
im really disappointed overall from feeling sick with the low quality cgi to taking nc scenes to another level it was actually the acting that put me off or should i say stiff pouty bible i had high hopes and i feel cheated right now fuaiz and bas were a good surprise
the best bl i have see
acting of cast is so professional
sex parts are amazing
over all i really enjoying to watch this series and i cant wait for next part
tattoos of bible leg and that shut was so sweet
but actually im fan of that cop guy
i hope next episodes will be good like the previous ones
also i didnt got last sequence in episode 4 about tonkla brother is he dead or no what happened if any body know pleas tell me
why is the picture so blurry
im at the end of the first episode on gagaoolala 1080px but im already on the verge of dropping it
in most scenes only the closeup shots are in focus and often even those arent sharp
i get that this is a film composition style but this way the picture is unenjoyable its making me physically uncomfortable
