This was a very interesting series. Although I get that it was hard to follow. And I think something was missed at the end. My interpretation is that Eps 6-8 were the original timeline before the first 4 minute jump back. Only the last scene doesn't fit with this theory.

Felt sorry for Korn and Ton kla. Korn really loved him, but Great and Tyme are my comfort zone. So glad they had a happy ending. Excellent story writing. Superb acting. Kudos.

This is one of my top BL for 2024. Everything about it was fantastic. Korn and Tonkla got me. 😭 Looks like my babies got their happy ending. He was saving him even though he was in his own 4 Minutes. I chose to believe the courts had mercy for Great. 👍🏾👍🏾

That girl is such a desperado… why force someone to marry you… and she knows Korn likes men. honey… boe out gracefully… you are not his type.

the writing is still so poor in Thai BL's. they have great actors that would do so much better with better written screenplay. all the extended pauses with nothing to say, is just bad writing.

Could you imagine that your brother's ex-lover shot you in the elevator of your own condo? That is nasty work.

Dad is a piece of shit!! Blaming everyone except himself and his stupid wife. Korn needs to get himself together and stop letting his dad and step mother use him. This girl is shady too and if Korn marries her, he'll be even more miserable. This show is crazy as hell. Just crazy!

Holy mother of god! This episode 6 is BRILLIANT! This is amazing storytelling! God it's so clever! The difference between how the main character sees himself and how he actually is reality is perfection! Incredible acting on everyone's part! Jesus Christ this was amazing!

Korn didn’t even wait to hear the full details of her dad can help before he agreed to abandon Tonkla and marry her. For someone who is being trained to be in charge of a major crime operation, he’s far too easy to manipulate.

okay wait I'm loving this series, yet I'm terribly confused rn n sad if Great or Thyme dies🥺....is this a parallel type universe where it's centered around 4 minutes? in the 1st episode it shows Thyme being shot. now Great is shot n his mother dies while holding him😑 is Dome...

im thinking in episode one, the person who's heart stopped at 11 oclock was Great's and now he's in this limbo area (that weird gallery area where that woman lukwa was in with him). Question is which version of reality will become the "real" version? (1)

Replying to User702aafe0b: only he sees, goes up by 1 minutes. first day he kept seeing 11:00, then 11:01 and it kept counting down. last we seen, it was on 11:03. we're almost at the end. Hopefully he doesn't die and everything in the new TL will work itself out.

Replying to User702aafe0b: Great gets shot in both TLs. The very first scene of episode 1 where the patient's heart stopped was Great's i do believe. his heart stopped at 11 and now we're experiencing his heart stop phenomenon. my theory is, he gets 4 days to experience this. because each day the clock

Replying to KittyGLex: I think the first timeline is real. Which leads to the question what happened to Great? Why is he unconscious, in a coma or dying? We know from Episode one that Dr Tyme gets shot, what happens next ?

Replying to KittyGLex: in the New TL, everyone is saved, he meets Tyme, parents get busted, but he gets shot. ALSO, since Dome doesn't die, Tonkla and Win wouldnt meet and Tonkla wouldnt kill Title for revenge....idk which TL I want lol i want everyone to meet and be safe and happy lol

in the OG TL, Great doesnt save anyone and also doesnt get shot my the hitman the woman hired cause she wouldve died in the tunnel. he also wouldnt meet Tyme. Also in the OG TL, Tonkla and Win WOULD meet because Dome wouldve died still.

I love this series so much so far. All the plot twists and unanswered questions.. I love jaw dropping moments. this whole concept is incredible. great is in his 4 minutes of cardiac arrest and with each minute on the clock, I finally realized what was happening. 10/10 so far

Both Korn and Win have used Tonkla’s vulnerability to their advantage. Korn when Tonkla is experiencing violence at home and Win when Tonkla is grieving his brother.

I agree. I'm so confused on that. but I think everything that has happened with great is all within the 4 minutes of cardiac arrest he is in. like it's all in his head like he's thinking about how things could have been different in his life. butttt I'm not 100% on that theory
