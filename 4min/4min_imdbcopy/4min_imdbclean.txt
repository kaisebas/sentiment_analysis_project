deep thinking
it is not hard to understand the storyline as everyone said as there are clues from the very first episode connecting dots can take time for the people who are new to this type of mystery genre
everyone did well and showcased their best their stuble movements and eye contacts one of the best series
my first thought when i came to know there are only 8 episodes was it is too short but after watching i know it is just right
this drama is first straight drama that i ever saw with no nonsense attitude
jesbible chemistry suprisngly clicked well it is just wow
2 different timelines along with current timeline made me soo anxoius if they are going to stay in any timeline but ultimately coming back to reality is also kindof informing us even though our past effect our present but we still can change things around to move forword the life we wanted
impressively good
an amazing series intelligent script brilliant direction impressive performances a rarely seen aesthetic with all the visual details so meticulously crafted starting with the cast bible jes fuaiz bas wow perfect in every way the soundtrack is perfectly fitting everything everything is so wellexecuted and accomplished the cherry on top why you dont stay by jeff satur at the end this level of quality is so appreciated because its not common without a doubt one of the best thai series in terms of quality alongside i told sunset about you my applause dont look for spoilers just watch it let your mind explode on this dark journey
a captivating storyline with a clear message
spinning my head
this series is not even over but it is for adults only as i say i am over six decades it is not an issue for me but minors no the plots yes plots are keeping my mind spinning but in a good way it wasnt a cookie cutter bl series which keeps me going back and see if i missed something the beginning was interesting but as i continue to watch it is throwing me for loops and turns the characters are in synergy with each others where as i believe in their relationships theyre able to portray their characters in a way that believable theres no confusion as to if theyre friends or lovers which i have problems with series that are not clear the locations were assets to the plots  honestly i rate this one with unknown  and kin and porsche as to how many times it would be a go to series to watch and never get tired of it i hope to see more mature characters for adults to enjoy
oh where did my update 1 go
its a matter of tastes
it turned out its not really my cup of tea its somewhat highly rated in the genre but i couldnt get into it at all i am not hooked on the story or the basic premise its just not done well or interesting enough and then on top of that you have the fact that its a bl but its one of those extremely explicit ones verging on exploitation and when i say verging i mean it is exploitative theres no added value to showing that much in adult scenes other than to titillate and i am not the target demographic for that so unfortunately it doesnt deliver for me on either fronts i just finished episode 1 and i got plenty of spoilers on mdl so i concluded the story itself holds no interest for me its very whack so no thank you
also struggling with not me also praised but really not interested in that story either although so far i got up to episode 4
