MAYBE, (a girl can hope), the shooting happening so early means we don't have bible dead in the end and time moves forward once he's saved .. (wishful thinking, probably).. Maybe next week we start 4 minutes for tyme. :)

I am wondering if there is a separate timeline for Tyme because at the end we see flashes of him with blood on his nose and we know that he gets shot at some point. So it might be that it happened in that timeline as opposed to this one. Idk!

I was just saying this in another comment but it occurred to me that we could actually have 3 timelines - a) the original, b) Great's and then c) Tyme's. Because we've now seen Tonkla seemingly kill Title in two different timelines (if we assume that the person he killed in the beginning scene of one of the eps a few weeks ago was also Title, since they didn't show it to us).

But yeah I definitely think there are at least two and we must get to see them somehow because there's both the bar scene + the pool table etc and I don't see how those could happen after the events so far, lol.

I really love his characterization so far. Any other similar character like Korn would have completely descended into evil by episode 2 or 3 but we‚Äôre more than halfway through and we‚Äôre still second guessing if he‚Äôll be the final villain at the end or not.

It‚Äôs great that they show how he genuinely loves Tonkla and deeply cares for Great. We love a complex character.

I love Korn and where they're taking his character. You can really feel how impossible it is for him. He cares about people and wants to love them. He also wants to prove himself to his father. But he's really been put in an impossible situation. He can't have both.

Clearly I have been doing camping wrong all my life.

Also, I decided to go back and watch ep 1-4 because it wasn't available in my area, and the subs I found were horrible. I figured proper translation might help the story a bit.

I totally forgot about the opening scene with Tyme being shot. He's wearing the same clothes as the end of ep 5. This is where binging everything all at one time helps. You don't forget details from a month ago.

Update: Well after starting the rewatch to figure out what I missed...

iQIYI is NOT showing the "sultrier" version (at least not on the app on my Roku tv)

where exactly was the black cat with Tonkla in the beginning?

Update to my Update

iQIYI DOES have the "sultrier" version. I went to watch ep 5 within 10 minutes of it being released, and there was only one option. Now they are both there. My bad. Operator error.

I found the cat. It was a blink and you miss moment.

Holy fucking shit.

I'm willing to eat crow about Korn. Bas's facial acting during his scene with Fasai where she said he'd have to marry her - damn, the way he swallowed down his feelings for Tongkla because he knew he was painted into a corner. Jesus, it hurt so much that I felt it lodged in my throat, too. That was him killing his love for Tongkla to save his family's reputation (bro it's not worth it!!)

Is Title Fasai's brother? The cold openings obviously aren't in chronological order, so we are seeing how Tongkla must have gotten Title before he killed him (I assume). One thing I'm curious about is if Win actually knew about Tongkla's fingerprints on the rock BEFORE he went to help him with Dome's funeral. That phone call he got during that one cold open could have been when Tongkla was asking for help. So, maybe we've kind of been misinterpreting some of the looks on Win's face. Obviously he has feelings for Tongkla, but maybe there's more conflict there because he knows he's fallen for a murderer and is either trying to cover it up (and thus be just as corrupt as his boss), or trying to get close to Tongkla for evidence? I dunno - I feel like there is more going on to that relationship than meets the eye. Just a hunch.

Jesus... so Great went back in time to save his mother, and it didn't fucking matter. She died anyway. The actor playing his mom did such a good job in that scene. All the women were spectacular this episode. Nan was great, and so was Manee. Just the rage she had inside of her bubbled out of her gaze. Too bad it was the wrong side of the family that got killed.

There was no sense of calm in this episode. Everything was on a knife's edge. That dinner scene at Tyme's house was so tense. Even when they were at that gorgeous campsite, it felt like a dream, but one you know you're going to wake up from, and it's going to be total shit when you do wake up, so it's not even comforting. And it all just became a nightmare for Great. As soon as he kissed Tyme goodbye in the car, everything in his life fell through his fingers. He and Korn fought and Korn blocked him. Tyme was threatened and 'ditched' him (at least from Great's POV), his family's foundation was built on a pile of shit, and then he tries to save his mom from dying, and she dies anyway, and now he's on death's door. :( FUCK I LOVE THIS SHOW

This blue shirt that Tyme is wearing is the shirt he was wearing when he got shot in the beginning of episode 1. So are we going to see Tyme's 4 Minutes now? Will this show end where they are both just dead, and Korn marries someone he doesn't love, and the man he loves goes to prison/is executed for killing the son of a prominent and dangerous man? Honestly, I would kind of love that? I know that everyone wants happy endings, but I kind of love that with DFF and now this, Sammon is just like "fuck your happy ending hahahaha" Queen Behavior.

EDIT: Perhaps the campground that Great "just found" without knowing where it was is purgatory/limbo, and they are both dying. They both want to stay there but can't. I said above it's like a dream you don't want to wake up from, but maybe that's literal. This is the last place they can be together

Same, I was wondering if Win knew.

Perhaps the campground that Great "just found" without knowing where it was is purgatory/limbo, and they are both dying. They both want to stay there but can't.

the black and white clothes and the fact that nothing is moving there, even trees, there is not wind, no animal, no time, no other people, all those facts make the scene dreamy and not real at all, so I kind of share that idea of purgatory, or at least a place where their vision/consciousness merge together

Okay, so my incoherent thoughts:

I was really not expecting the end of this episode because tbh I thought that we wouldn't see the scenes where Tyme & Great get hurt until the last episode. But now it's already happened for Great which has kind of thrown that idea on its ear, haha. But every time I think I know what to expect for next week I am thrown for a loop.

I am tentatively wondering if the other timeline that we see flashes of is Tyme's timeline. We see him with blood on his nose at the end and then without, just like we saw Tonkla with and without Dome in the last episode. We've known all along that there are different versions of events but now I am wondering if what's going to happen is that now we're going to see Tyme's version? Perhaps ep 6 & 7 tell the story from that timeline and then ep 8 wraps everything up?

I find it really interesting how we see a contrast in passitivity from Korn vs Great actively choosing action in all his changes. Korn feels helpless and as though he has no way out, even though there are likely choices available to him if he'd just take them. He doesn't, though, which just leads to him getting mired deeper.

I really, really hope that this wraps up well because there's so much going on. I appreciate how much Sammon packs into her shows but there's the lady and her son, there's Nan and her friend, there's KornWinTonkla and then there's Tyme and Great. BUT on the other hand now that we kind of know the over-arcing 'plot' I guess now we have three episodes to solve it...? But I'm worried that there's still even more going to be packed in and that it's going to be a kind of unsatisfying ending.

I also can't help but wish that we had more time with Tyme and Great... This episode was 48 minutes and I feel like they could have added another ten minutes or so and had some more time for them out at the campsite thing.

The guitar annoyed me, but what really set me off was Tyme talking about not being happy. It might be a translation issue, but it doesn't sound good from any angle I've explored.

Great would be justified in literally kicking him out of the hammock. They had just spent a steamy night together. That is the kind of moment you are supposed to say cheesy stuff like "...until I met you" to avoid hurting your lover's feelings.

Tyme hurt Great again in the same scene with his "I have nothing to lose" line. I'm surprised that Great kept his cool after that remark.

Okay honestly I am usually a certified guitar hater x1000 but I actually didn't mind it here? Like I thought the gentle song was kinda cute and added to the dreamy/surreal feeling of the camp site.... like they got transported and are suddenly inhabiting a cute BL scene/set somehow in the middle of their shared nightmare.

y'all i loved todays episode like i liked it better than the all episodes so far. so that means great was just reliving his memories in those four minutes and what could be have done differently? none of it was real? shit, it makes sense but i do have a lot of questions (like going by this theory if that woman that great saved supposedly died in the real world then who sent the goon to kill his family..)

I can't even form thoughts on this series anymore I almost just wanna go into it surprised without any theories üò≠

So Tonkla is def gonna kill Title bc he knows that's who killed his brother (but also he's still alive in another timeline wtf)

I still don't like Korn tbh I get that he's stuck but he could do the right thing, and even. If he needs to get married to that woman he doesn't need to actually romance her and kiss her hand like that lol she's calling Tonkla is boy toy but she's basically using Korn as hers

I'm glad we got more GreatTyme but at what cost üò≠ üò≠

ALSO Great's conversation with Korn reminded me of the story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas by Ursula K Le Guin

It's about a utopian society that secretly relies upon the utter suffering of one child, but when the citizens find out about this, they have a choice to remain in the "paradise" or to leave and never come back.

Great is like the ones who walk away because they don't want to live in a place that is made from someone else suffering.

It was set up for exclusivity for 4 eps. Gaga gave a hint on Aug 6 that they would get it after that deal.

What a tense episode. Like a quiet, on the edge of your seat kind of tense.

Do we know how Korn‚Äôs mom died? Was she sick of was she pushed out to make room for Great‚Äôs mom aka the mistress who got the gambling den off the ground and worked hard to get her and her son out of the shadows?? üëÄ Her pushing Korn into the illegal side of the business to make room for Great to take over the clean side. Oof.

I want so bad for Korn to just let the family/family business go up in flames. Put yourself first Korn!

Hard agree with the comments that suggest the campsite being purgatory/limbo. Everything just felt too calm, too still, too peaceful. Now does white represent death or does black? ü§î

With the shot heard around the world, things seem to be getting ready to wrap up but in three episodes?! Feels like this should be a ten episode series, not eight üò©

Makes sense, he was looking to the past with the knowledge of the future... Let's see what we get from now on... Exciting. I don't believe we will have a hea with this one...ughhhh...I should have known...I was not strong enough to avoid starting to watch it, now we suffer...s2g

Ok, I thought we would have answers in this episodes and it was just more questions.
I would never have thought they would dare to kill Great so soon. of course he will come back somehow, but we thought that this was the "new timeline" and he ended up almost dying like the original one or this was the original one?

Great's murder was ordered by the woman he saved? Oh delicious irony, as rumor says, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

By the way the guy who killed Great here is the same who killed Tyme in the first episode
https://x.com/Evulienka3/status/1827037367301284032

Den says that one of possible effects of cardiac arrest is fix their mistakes and having supernatural powers, so we can't discard the fantasy element here.

I think it's pretty confirmed that TonKla killed Title in revenge for his brother

Maybe it's more like: karma is a bitch and no one can escape her, since originally Great committed a hit and run on that poor woman. I mean he's trying to make things better, but somehow it still ends up a shit pile. OR it's like in Triage where the MC needs to find the right thing to change, otherwise the ML just keeps on dying over and over again

I thought maybe pre credits were running in order but that would mean Tonkla killed someone else with a rock...

Dr Den (who draws circles for some reason) said that when patients have a cardiac arrest they re-live past experiences, some have supernatural powers, some go back to fix past mistakes and some get a fresh start with those they love. Patients experiences feel real but aren't entirely accurate. If we just watched Great go through this with only a minute left, I'm with the guesses that Tymes 4 minutes are next and it will be a different version of events. There has to be a reason we've seen things flash and change and then go back, like the thai tea that said 'don't forget to treat your wound' to 'I'm sorry Great' and back. What really happened and why is Manee hiring a hit man after Greats family.

The beginning seemed out of place. Why are they having a chilled picnic with everything going on lol? Great said he wishes he could stay forever but probably can't and Tyme singing a song with the lyrics - if we could meet again my heart will still give it to you. I'll remember this day, those memories forever. To meet in the land of twilights veil in a world where time stands still. Its very ominous.

I think I'd love any ending with this show. It's just too good üòÖ

(Copying from a reply I made on another outlet) I'm just going to accept that every theory I have is wrong, and every idea I can think of is only part of the whole story. I love how this keeps me on my toes!! I love puzzles and usually figure stuff out..but this one makes me feel stupid until the end (which I usually have to make myself do, so I don't give away the story for anything else I read or watch) but figuring this out and still seeing something coming out of left field and not knowing how it impacts everything else I think I already know is incredible.

These characters are becoming so much more than 2D every time I watch an episode. I learn something new, whether it be backstory, motive, emotions...and it's all tying into a greater plot I cannot wrap my head around. Loving it so far!!

IM SO CONFUSED... Ep 4 last scene we saw that guy (tonkla's bro) was still alive.. and this episode it felt like im watching a whole new drama.. so many things happened and went above my head... Wym Great died? Tbvh i dont think he can die thay easily he is the main character.... So many questions... Why did that guy shot him and his mom? Did his dad order? Who was he? What was that lady praying for.? What was the purpose ? I know she is somehow connected to this murder situation.. like she knows someone is gonna die n stuff after that paper with those words...... Also i didn't expect tyme to be that selfish üò≠... Man took the 5M and went on... Or maybe theres something mroe we dont know yet... idk why i have a feeling they're rushing the series why is it just 8 episodes man...

Tyme accepted the money for the gangsters to leave his grandmother alone, I guess they would have killed both of them in the house if he did not accept.

The lady at the shrine is the same lady from episode 1, from the car accident. She gives money to an assassin to kill Great's parents because they were responsible for her son's death. The guy that shot Graeat and his mom is the assassin from the shrine. In the real timeline the lady died after the car accident so I guess the shrine scene happened before she was hit by Great.

I'm glad they've clarified the general plot as this point, but I still have questions:

So exactly what is real and what was not? I thought the 4-minute explanation meant that people were hallucinating about going back in time to fix their mistakes. That would imply that Great saved the woman in the first place, and that's how she managed to hire the hit man to kill him/his mom. So is he trying to leave her there so she never comes after him?

Also, in the first scene Great ran away from Tyme and later changed it so that he met Tyme instead. So does it mean the first time, he never really met Tyme at all? Or that he wished he drove away instead of coming back to save his mom?

I get what they're implying, but the mechanics are still confusing to me. Or maybe I'm just reading too deep into this

As much as I don't like Korn, I sympathise with him as he has gone through a lot and his the oldest son so he has to take up a lot of work given by his father with a lot of expectations. I get why Korn feels like everything is blamed on him. His father is a piece of shit and his stepmother sees her son as 'he cannot do no wrong'.
