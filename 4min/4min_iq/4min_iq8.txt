Korn and Ton Kla were doomed from the start. 💔 They couldn’t get it together in any time line. So very sad. Poor Ton Kla had some serious PTSD and terrible coping mechanisms.

Compelling and interesting up to episode 5, then everything goes haywire. Great loses his 4 minute power and we have a re-run of the whole story showing the worst outcomes, without any explanation. Why ? Weird. The sex scenes, for once, were the most accurate and genuine.

i think you’re missing the point of the drama. he has no such thing as powers - his 4 minutes were simply him reliving life & removing his regrets in the 4 minutes before becoming brain dead. Having a superpower doesnt make u great, redeeming yourself does & taking accountability

I’m glad I am not the only one it was so confusing, I keep rewatching it to try to understand what’s happening but it’s not helping much, honestly it’s still a good show though but it’s very confusing.

I love this series. I love how we have been able to see the strong influence of going down the wrong path in our choices and how it was always in us to do the right thing. Not wait till our life is flashing before our eyes close to death to try to change it.

You have the real timeline where Great is shot by Ton Kla. You have Great’s 4 minutes while he is dying timeline. You have most of Tyme’s 4 minutes dying timeline in this ep

Loved the series, but I don’t feel satisfied with this being the last episode. Totally no fault of the actors…all about the storyline.

This is def a series you need to binge or you may give up in the middle due to confusion. Good story once it all comes together, but so disjointed along the way.

Jesus Lord. This has been one of my favorite brain scramblings ever in a series. Just excellent. The cast and crew should take so much pride in what they were able to accomplish with this masterpiece.😊

It’s over! Fridays won’t be the same! 4 minutes has raised my expectations of BL series and I’m not sure what to watch next. Also was the music at the end from the song Why Don’t You Stay ( KinnPorsche soundtrack) with different lyrics ?

The best of the year! Well-crafted plot, kept you guessing and hoping from first to last episode. The main actors, Jes and Bible were outstanding. Their complicated characters and relationship kept the series alive. The supporting actors and stories filled out this narrative.

I didn’t get the story either but I love the actors. It’s all very confusing and too many loose ends. For example… is Tyme a physician or a surgeon???🤦‍♀️

Maybe because two of the characters played in KP? maybe they suggested that they put that song in there because we all love it ,but with a different spin on the lyrics.

Real timelin: Tonkla shoots Great, Dome is dead, Tonkla and Korn are dead at the end, Great and Tyme almost die. While Great and Tyme are almost dying, they create in their dying imagination the two other “timelines” shown. Great’s for most of the series. Tyme’s mostly in ep8.
