I didn't like this series. Too explicit and zero chemistry between the main actors. Their intimate interaction was painful and uncomfortable to watch. There was nothing natural and fluid in them. I don't think I'll watch another series with them.

Excellent series. They do tell you pretty early what was really going on when that one other lady with the "same symptoms" explained it. And I think it's a great watch either way, but I'm glad I caught it because then I knew I was watching a tragedy and could prepare myself.

I think I'm starting to understand. we are seeing what greats mind looks like in the 4 minutes that he doesn't have oxygen to his brain after getting shot. The visions of the future aren't visions but is what actually happened in real life.

He’s always trying to get someone to hit it raw… I’m thinking he has something and is trying to pass it along to his partners.

nah... I see it more in the psychological level. He wants to feel the deeper feeling of intimacy, and perhaps makes him feel that he is loved.

What a weird observation?! It’s clear that he is dealing with a lot of emotional pain. For this character sex is the medicine reckless sex that is. It’s the only way he knows how to deal with his pain.
