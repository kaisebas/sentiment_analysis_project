What a ride! I watched with a friend because it was too stressful to watch alone! We helped each other follow the plot! I really like that every character was morally grey. My theory is everyone's dead at the end (or as my friend put it, 'They're all in dead land!')

Amazing story, wonderful actors. Well executed. The people who are talking sh*t about the series haven't really seen a good series with an amazing plot. A lot of NCs won't make a series good. Everything was well balanced in this.

Wow. So. Very. Confused! So is the person Ton Kla killed in an earlier episode actually him killing Title, but the storylines are all in random order? And where did the 4 minutes go? Are the 4 minutes memories the dying Great is reliving so he has a chance to choose better?

Yes! Ton Kla killed Title, then tries to kill Great. The 4 minutes from my understanding has always been before death, what we saw before were theories like what would have happened if Great made different decisions.

I think you ppl think of this as a continuous story and not just one episode at a time it’ll make more sense. We are seeing all of the characters reality vs 4 minutes to fix it. I’m hopeful for the last episode and love this series.

I do think the last episode will tie everything together. It’s just a lot to pull into one episode, maybe they will make it longer? I think the confusion lies in the fact we get a detail that coincides w/the next, and since we have to wait every week everyone theorizes.

It looks as there can be no happy endings for any of the characters. Korn has been left to pick up the pieces by his dad. Great & Tyme might not survive, Grandma has been shot and Tonkla has seen too much sadness & ended too many lives to be happy. Friday is too far away.

Personally they could have ended it with the scene in the hospital with Tyme holding Great’s hand and apologizing. I probably wont look at the last episode. The only ending that would work for me is if they were both actually dead and they walk into the light holding hands.

Replying to User7ebd842dc: He did. Remember the bloody rock? It was from Ton Kla. The actual scene will probably be shown next week. That’s why he went after Great, because he saw the video of them both. Great was shot because he is seen helping dump Dome’s body.

Why granny kept the diary, is beyond me. She knew her child fudged up and kept the evidence, for what? Is granny the wicketkeeper? If Tyme didn’t keep the diary, all this wouldn’t have unfolded. If he did, when did the 4 mins begin? 🫤
