I was thinking the same thing, but I think they want to show a different perspective of him as an actor since Vegas was so intense and aggressive…this portrait a gentle angle of him ….but it’s undeniable that his personality is way to strong to be a submissive…!!!!❤️✌️

For anyone confused by the plot, re-watch eps 1-5 with special attention paid to Thyme’s doctor friend researching near death experiences. There’s a lot of subtlety in the way details emerge that requires following along closely. That’s my advice.

Episode 6 is what really happened (the present) and episode 1-5 is what choices Great wish he would’ve made in the past. So 1-5 is technically his past based off of epi 6. I’m guessing epi 6 is the beginning and then 1-5 follows after he gets shot.

This series keeps getting better with each episode. Next Friday seems too far away, I need to know what happens next.

The acting is so well done. I think this is the real time line. What is Korn going to do when he finds out Tonkla shot his brother?!

Amazing series! Plot, acting, setting, photography all connected perfectly. My favorite BL since I started watching series in 2014.
