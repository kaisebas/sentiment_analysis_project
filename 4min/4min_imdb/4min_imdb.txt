Deep thinking
It is not hard to understand the storyline as everyone said, as there are clues from the very first episode, connecting dots can take time for the people who are new to this type of mystery genre.

Everyone did well and showcased their best Their stuble movements and eye contacts. One of the best series.

My first thought when i came to know there are only 8 episodes was it is too short but after watching i know it is just right

This drama is first straight drama that i ever saw with no nonsense attitude.

JesBible chemistry suprisngly clicked well. It is just wow

2 different timelines along with current timeline made me soo anxoius if they are going to stay in any timeline but ultimately coming back to reality is also kindof informing us even though our past effect our present but we still can change things around to move forword the life we wanted.

Impressively good
An amazing series. Intelligent script, brilliant direction, impressive performances, a rarely seen aesthetic (with all the visual details so meticulously crafted!), starting with the cast (Bible, Jes, Fuaiz, Bas, wow). Perfect in every way. The soundtrack is perfectly fitting. Everything, everything, is so well-executed and accomplished. The cherry on top, 'Why you don't stay' by Jeff Satur at the end. This level of quality is so appreciated because it's not common. Without a doubt, one of the best Thai series in terms of quality, alongside 'I Told Sunset About You'. My applause. Don't look for spoilers, just watch it. Let your mind explode on this dark journey.

Spinning My Head
This series is not even over but it is for adults only. As I say I am over six decades it is not an issue for me but minors no. The plots, yes plots are keeping my mind spinning but in a good way. It wasn't a cookie cutter bl series which keeps me going back and see if I missed something. The beginning was interesting but as I continue to watch it is throwing me for loops and turns. The characters are in synergy with each others. Where as I believe in their relationships. They're able to portray their characters in a way that believable. There's no confusion as to if they're friends or lovers. Which I have problems with series that are not clear. The locations were assets to the plots . Honestly, I rate this one with "Unknown " and "Kin and Porsche" as to how many times it would be a go to series to watch and never get tired of it. I hope to see more mature characters for adults to enjoy.

Oh where did my update 1 go.

It's a matter of tastes
It turned out it's not really my cup of tea. It's somewhat highly rated in the genre but I couldn't get into it at all. I am not hooked on the story, or the basic premise, it's just not done well, or interesting enough, and then on top of that you have the fact that it's a BL, but it's one of those extremely explicit ones, verging on exploitation, and when I say verging I mean it is exploitative. There's no added value to showing that much in adult scenes other than to titillate and I am not the target demographic for that. So unfortunately it doesn't deliver for me on either fronts, I just finished episode 1 and I got plenty of spoilers on MDL so I concluded the story itself holds no interest for me, it's very whack, so no, thank you.

Also struggling with Not Me, also praised, but really not interested in that story either, although so far I got up to episode 4.
