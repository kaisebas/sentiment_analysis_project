This is so good. Who saved Sun? Did that person make an 'erase' wish and somehow they ended up saving him? We know very little about Q, the wishes and the rules, and that's a bit frustrating, but it makes sense if they want to keep it intriguing till the end of the show.

And Q's past sounds so painfulü•∫

I like your theory about an erase wish from someone else bringing him back. My immediate thought was that since Q "won" his "prize" was a wish that he would have used to free himself from being a reaper but used on Sunshine instead. Since Q made the comment that he didn't know what he would receive if he "won".

I think Q's past will be very painful and so Sunshine will use his last wish to erase Q to free him from the suffering or maybe get creative and erase "cupid reaper" which would free him??

I honestly wish we could have focused on Q instead. Like Sunshine No Sunshine should have been one episode person that he grants 3 wishes and moves on to the next LOL

What if it was Rain from another timeline that wished Q back? What if Rain is the one in that universe who has a Reaper visiting him?

Just kiss already!!! Sorry, I can't focus on the plot while these two decidedly choose to not kiss! All I get from this episode is the bedroom eyes.

Someone suggested that Q and Sunshine were intertwined in the past -- maybe Q erased Sunshine at some point. Q definitely seems like a person in love.

in the last episode Q definitely was giving DESPERATE for Sunshine to kiss him and DISAPPOINTED when it didn't happen during their almost-kiss.

Does the 'Sunshine was erased' theory also dovetail with his personal narrative of being deserted by everyone? I don't have the brain capacity to think that through.

Special appreciation to the actor that plays Q wow he's so handsome and cute when he smiles‚ù§

This ep is like a bromance but a delulu person like me interprets it as romance üòÇ finally Sunshine be like Rain is not worth it ...after all his shenanigans..he didn't even bother to greet/talk to him lolü§°... When they touch the roses...faces and give roses waah as a q√ósunshine shipper ü§°i loved it.... And when their faces inch closer and closer i wanted to push their faces together and make them kiss‚ù§... Also loved how sunshine Talked about universe/ppl üëçthat was a new perspective that was relatable.... This felt like filling up ep 10 except for sunshine's revival/realizing his mistake...it did not add much to the story... Still love this series... And also this ep‚ù§i loved their eye contacts/dates it was a happy ep overall‚ù§

Next week's preview seems interesting üëç‚ù§

This series really surprised me with how deep it is. Initially it was kind of a mess, but as the series progressed, the narrative, and especially the performances have really opened up in a major way. I absolutely love Atom and Jet (Sunshine and Qiu) together, they work off each other so well. I am praying that they get to work together in the future. Whether they get together or not in the end, their interactions have been absolutely beautiful and poignant.

Being a geek, the supernatural aspect of this series had me hooked as soon as they kicked in. I love the idea of multiverses, and alternate timelines. I also love the idea of demons and angels manipulating mankind. This so far is one of my favorite series of 2023.
