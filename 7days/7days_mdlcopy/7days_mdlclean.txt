deserves more love
week after week i would check the rating here on mdl to see if other people were seeing what i was seeing yet the rating remains consistently poor if youve come down to the review section out of curiosity please dont let the low average rating scare you away this is a beautiful show that gets better the more you engage with it as a viewer
i think the thing that might be throwing many people is actually the thing i also like most namely that this series is more like a stage play than a tv show there are a limited number of sets a relatively small cast of characters and high dialogue to action ratio this ties in with the main characters profession as a play actor and also serves in a metacontextual way of engaging with the act of storytelling in a rather novel way not only does this show have a main plot and a few subplots but everything about it is also a love letter to the very notion of storytelling itself characters serve as standins for the audience the chorus and even the storyteller in turns its a fun device that really adds to the depth of each and every shot line of dialogue and character choice made along the way
i also have to applaud the way that this show handles religion and spirituality and the supernatural its also a deep dive into grief and loss honestly theres so much to this show also jared is adorable and its worth watching for each of his appearances onscreen alone
beautiful story and beautifully shot
first this is not for everyone if youre expecting a bl you can stop expecting a bl  its not one there is an lgbt aspect of the story and the male gaze is present as atom wears very little thorughout which is a goldmine for shallow people like me and when he is dressed up he looks amazing
reading the comments section there is a bit of overstatement of the theatricality of the series it is intentionally playlike but the purely visual elements are of equal importance to the dialogue and i think that because this was deceptively marketed a bl the audience was looking for bl and not seeing what was really there and you cant blame the audience for that
if you approach this as a straightforward story you may hate it  its an allegory so its important to think about what everyting symbolizes and what is metaphor and what the message is
there are many related themes a couple of the more surfacy ones being the futility of secondguessing past decisions  and the utility of atonement in order to move on
the structure of the story has sunshine given the power to totally erase a person from the universe each night for 7 days before valentines  i wish these productions could get the grammar of the title correct and the correct decision will bring love back to him each erasure has a lessson but this causes the biggest problem with the series and what i think is the main reason so many people disliked it andor dropped it
its too long one of the erasures is a selfindulgent political statement by the writer which didnt belong in here what would have been more meaningful and universal would have been to erase the conservative ending up in a stalinist farleft conformity as without balance even the side youre on can become descend into oppression
another of the erasures just makes sunshine evil and malicious and should not have been included some of his decisions are bad but viewed through the lens of his heartbreak is understandable but this one isnt  its just awful of him
the acting in this is fantastic  the series rests firmly on atoms shoulders and he carries it his heartbreak is heartbreaking his smile is even worse so beautiful it hurts and theres a scene with him on stage thats worth it in itself jet is good too but he has a more limited range and i dont think he quite kept up with atom the small parts are all very well acted even annoying stock characters that made them all compelling like jared the flower guy who could have just been irritating but its hard not to fall in love with him
i loved this series but i did feel it bogged down in the middle if you can put up with that the end is worth it but again this is not a bl so dont watch it expecting one

theatrical series that needed tighter pacing especially in the beginningmiddle
overall although i liked the unique premise it felt like the director or writer was also the editor and couldnt bear to removeedit down any of the scenes that they filmed 12 episodes about 45 minutes each aired on wetv
content warnings deaths off screen suicide selfharm manipulation mental health struggles grief
what i liked
 unique premise
 production value lighting felt very theatrical
 styling choices especially that first scene
 incorporating symbolismmetaphors
 discussion social justice issues such as same sex marriage
 in episode 4 they argued realistically by talking over one another
 bathtub scenes
 they ended the series 7 days before valentines day
room for improvement
 a ton narration ie telling vs showing the pacing felt very slow even watching at a faster speed this story would have done much better as 68 episodes this slow pacing and it airing over 12 weeks actually made my point below worse
 sunshine started as unlikable which is okay but the audience needed to see character growth before the last minute finally in episode 8 he seemed to have a little character growth but then his wish undid it then we saw a little more but by then it felt too little too late
 the mysteryworld building wasnt engaging it was confusing i think there was a lot of symbolismmetaphors that i didnt grasp they needed to explain things just a little bit moremore clearly

need to be watched in one go
i tell you what this drama has to be watched in one go why because you need to feel the characters in this very difficult storyline i loved it
first the story of kyu or q he call himself the cupid reaper 7 wishes to make people dessaper from the earth like they never existed he call himself a demon but was in fact a human who made bad choices to save his dad from death the back story of this character comes in small parts but episode 11 reveal more about him loving someone a lover or a family member is often push back from living your own life and you only realize your love when you are going to loose them that is the story that everyone can relate to
second the story of sunshine he is not a very good person or at least its what you think after only a few episodes he blame everyone but himself for his boyfriend rain braking up with him when he met q he decided to agree to the contract with him to erase people that are going against his lover and him each day he choose someone but by making those decisions he doesnt only affect his life but the whole world rains new lover disappearance didnt change the fact that he broke up with sunshine the politician disappearance changed the policy against gays the exlover disappearance made rain forget sunshine then rain s best friend disappearance made rain kill himself all those actions made sunshine question himself about who he is still not accepting the fact that rain disappeared because of his choices and blaming q when he finally made the wish to make everyone who was against their love rain didnt come back sunshine realised that maybe rain never really loved him he still wondered why he didnt disappeared instead as he was the real problem so he wished to disappear himself when he did everything came back and so did he apparently because someone wished him to come back but still no trace of rain and sunshine started to forget everything about him and his love for him when sunshine learned qs full story he also realised that it was his selfishness that made the choices of people disappearance not his love for rain because he forgot his love yet kept on making wishes he realised that he was in fact in love with the only person who understood him and helped him  q unfortunately to make the world as it was he wished for q to disappear
the story is mainly focus on those two sunshine and q everyone else are background characters even rain who is a main character in the drama yet we mainly see him in flashbacks or quick view of the present we learn about rains story through the episodes he make us like him very much and put light on sunshines selfishness i loved how you feel empathy for the guy who cheated on sunshine it also shows that the had nothing in commun and that their love was never going to work in the last episode when sunshine asked for forgiveness to rain and his new boyfriend after qs disappearance rain saw how sunshine had changed in 7 days even if they broke up they left as friend and it was nice to see
what was expected happened of course sunshine met q on the plane and they both recognise each other but what was strange is that they called each other q you can suspect that those wishes was in fact a travel through various universe sunshine suggested that in one episode and they are each others cupid reaper well never really know the ending was neither good or bad the dialogue between the two in the background suggest they will rediscover each other
the story was fantastic no sx not much kissing a bit of very sexy shirtless men but it is for all ages you can also often be frustrated by the sxual tension between s and q the acting was amazing too atom and jet are new actors but their performance was fantastic i mean most dialogues often very longue are between the two of them for people who knows about acting doing long dialogues while staying in characters is very difficult who doesnt remember ponlawit ketprapakorn pond in 180 degree longitude passes through us back in 2022 and those longue dialogues that is what this drama reminded me off
those who gave a low score didnt really watch it with their heart even if its a drama for everyone it is not an upbeat story about love it is about looking back into yourself when bad things happen into your life and how to move on without blaming anyone
absolutely worth the watch but know what youre going for
firs the big question is this a bl
no its really not but i like this because it is so unique the author was upfront about that the novella is a character study for sunshine it is a faustian tale where the lead happens to have a boyfriend but it really has no bearing on the rest of the plot it could have been female or male it makes no difference
this was an arthouse piece its a stage play in a series and i absolutely applaud the whole team and their work especially atom and jet this whole production hinged on them and they put in a solid performance adapting this particular novella was ambitious but i think the director was looking for the challenge i appreciate that they arent selling it on fan service with pointless makeout scenes with overly loud music there is intent here and more said in a longing looks than anything else and its one of the big selling points
this is not going to be for everyone and the ending is an openambiguous one but if youre like me and a fan of the offbeat and outside the norm this will for sure be right up your alley and absolutely worth the time to watch it through and give the novella a read as well its not a big commitment
vale a pena conferir

beautiful scars of life
this series is a gem for me offering profound insights into relationships the stages of grief and selfreflection it left me speechless with how realistic and relatable the lessons were often moving me to tears while some might find it slow or even dull at first especially if theyre expecting typical romantic clichs i truly believe that if youre going through a tough time or feeling lost this is a mustwatch initially i too was just watching out of boredom hoping for a lighthearted cheesy romance but by the second episode the depth of the story captivated me and i found myself reflecting on my own life without even realizing it life can be incredibly hardaccepting reality and knowing what to let go of can feel impossible at times we often react impulsively blaming others for our struggles when in fact the root of the problem lies deeper within ourselves there are no shortcuts in life we often forget to appreciate what we already have driven by the endless human desire for more life is uncertain and were often too scared to take risks trapped in our comfort zones not realizing weve become prisoners of our own making every action we take has an impact on those around us the consequences are inevitable and unavoidable

philosophical and original epic tale
this drama does not deserve the current rating 7110 i cant help but think if the main leads were played by more well known actors the rating wouldve gone through the roof they might not have done as good a job as the actual main leads though these men put on the show of their lives atom especially absolutely floored me with his performance he is truly an amazing actor
the overall feel of the drama is somewhat melancholy very much in line with the story which is an epic tale about life and death love and regret the dialogue is riddled with poetic and philosphical lines with this theres a danger of cringe but that never happens thanks to the immaculate delivery except for the audition scene where sunshines agony poors out i felt there was a bit of overacting going on here
there is no nc scene but the chemistry is absolutely there not the raw sensual kind but the slowly falling in love and getting to know eachother kind there are a few near kisses and these are actually enough
the story is reminiscent of supernatural kdramas with the twists of fate the agonizing dilemmas and letting go of your love  the feel is epic with a capital e
the music deserves an honorary mention no typical bl tunes here jazzy indie tunes kiss your ears like a smooth summer breeze
so if youre in for a drama about love philosophy referencing faust and macbeth with amazing acting and a melancholy feel watch this and be amazed

its beautiful but depressing af
its like the heaviest and most depressing bl ever its not even romantic just depressing loli guess some would call it artistic which it actually is
dont get me wrong the show could have been great i especially love the last episode its beautiful i mean there are lessons learnt etc but the way the show is being delivered is really really really hard to watch
i was enjoying for 1st half until i felt the story gets repetitive and eventually draggy it also gets really really really depressing that ive to skip most of it just to know the ending because i am curious
i wouldnt say the show is bad per se but it isnt my style unfortunately i feel heavy after watching this show which kinda leads me with a lingering bad after taste if u may
i mean i am someone who could watch thriller show but still this is even darker than murder show because its just so heavy emotionally like it just keep going down the rabbithole i dont enjoy it although logically i think the ending is very beautifully done if its of any comfort the reaper is hot af haha
a masterpiece and one of the best magnum opus
undoubtedly this is one of those series that will either be loved or panned mainly because of the esoteric and metaphysical nature of its theme and its presentation as a greek tragedy it is allegorical with metaphorical representations of life presented in temperaments of profound introspection surrounded by an almost overwhelming sense of loss guilt and shame it tackles all the hidden and unexplored and often times buried emotions of humans we do not want to face or find impossible to bear it strips away for us to see and quite literally experience and feel we see it through the eyes of a protagonist and an antagonist at the same time with each character being both this series is a thoughtprovoking intellectually stimulating elegy that uses the language of words to embody love if you want to see lust or romps in a bed or contrived love scenes or soft rituals of love this is not for you if you want to see a deep meditative and at times profoundly poignant perspective of human nature augmented by the process of finding what the meaning of love is all about then this is for you there is nothing cute about this transmigration at all it is deeply solipsistic pensive and intensely mystifying there is also nothing clear about this series it is symbolic with symbolisms of all kinds bombarding you at times they overwhelm you everything has meaning even the smallest of details blink and you might miss it you have to decipher their meanings much happens mostly through words but also through deep reflections in expressions of the faces manners and body language of the main two characters as well as all the other characters in this series
the rest of my review of this phenomenal series is posted at blblisscom
frustrating but enthralling
going into this show you need to understand that the protagonist is the most frustrating character you will ever encounter with a redemption arc that comes late in the show with that in mind it is still a very good show to watch i enjoy watching shows that tackle social commentary with unique means and this is exactly what this show does you get to reflect on society and yourself as well throughout the show the cinematography was beautiful and that aided in the overall storytelling why this is not a 1010 show for me was mostly because of the main character i understand that he is supposed to be unreasonable and i also understand that we are supposed to follow along his growth journey with him but i have a short temper so it was hard to watch sometimes but thats more of a me problem not anything inherently wrong with this show all in all this is a great show to watch and then ponder on some more in your free time
ps this is not really a bl in the way that you think of one it is a love story that entails men if that makes sense

nice intertime love story heavily influenced by goethe and genki kawamura
i recently started watching this series and was immediately captivated the storyline pretty straightforward sunshine makes a pact with a supernatural being who grants him 7 wishes in order to bring his boyfriend back very much like dr faustus did with the devil in the classic novel by goethe however to a different end and for this has a price to pay the price for every wish is to make someone disappear from the world an idea very similar to the exceptional novel if cats disappeared from the world by the japanese author genki kawamura which cost me two sleepless nights each wish predictably leads to unanticipated results which gradually teach sunshine a lesson about life and complexity the story is based on the book by patrick rangsimant but at least the few pages that i read there are differences especially with respect to the overall atmosphere in fact i like the adaptation more i cannot tell about the actual plot and its ending since the series is ongoing
the acting is quite good and the two main lead characters have great chemistry according to some research i did which i am not sure is correct this reflects their relationship in real life despite the reason for it they definitely are very convincing
technically the series is good the sound background very nice cut and angles are very good
having said that i do have some criticism as well i am not a huge fan of overall dramatized stories you know the one that make you cry all the time i like emotions to come in finite portions while here especially in the last episodes the drama simply grows and grows it is not a perpetual whining yet but i feel that the series would gain more with a touch of downtoearth objectivity but this is a matter of personal taste perhaps the second rather technical thing that bothers me are the countless flashbacks which not always serve a purpose i would go for shorter episodes since rewatching so many scenes again and again in most cases brings no new information
as a whole i am really enjoying this series which gratefully is not another highschool puppylove bl drama but explores more aspects of the human nature and clearly comes from the pen of an author with certain life experience and maturity we certainly need of those
cupid reaper falling for sunshine
im liking that this 10 episode giving me a love story with sunshine and kyu aka cupid reaper  i cant wait to watch next episode between these two characters  does sunshine fallen for kyu he starting to understand why rain left him for air he was an arrogant young man with his head in clouds   i think sunshine was to know more about kyu aka cupid reaper  is to understand your inner self  this why cupid reaper came into his life kyu made the same mistakes that he made by putting things right from the start

this is not a bl
yes there is romance yes there are hot guys kissing and yet it is not a bl it is so much more so if you are here for the bl you are bound to be disappointed hence the awful rating this drama has on mdl go watch something else
this is a story about grief relationship break up life selfishness and love
sunshine is an upandcoming actor whose boyfriend rain dumps him a week before valentines he finds himself drinking in a barflower shop and someone takes him home dead drunk that someone turns out to be kyu a cupid reaper who offers him seven chances to win his boyfriend back by erasing people he thinks are responsible for the break up as the days go by and people get deleted without rain coming back to him sun comes to the realization that the break up was actually his fault
what an interesting concept as grief management sun is incapable to see his own flaws and erasing people puts those flaws in the spotlight so the more he denies them the more they are visible until he has to admit it is his fault and nobody elses sun is young cocky full of certainties like a lot of young people are unwilling to accept that they do not know everything and that they are not the centre of the universe kyu the cupid reaper tries to warn him make him realize the error of his way but he stubbornly ploughs forward their relationship is admirably well written starting from the initial animosity and impatience to friendship and to love nothing is rushed
the production is perfect it is well written very theatrical in its set up since we mainly see sun and kyu on screen talking most of the action dialogue takes place in suns small flat they talk a lot and the director transposed to tv the theatrical set up with different lighting of different parts of the flat when sun tells the story of his relationship we see the flashback acted out in the background amazing idea works perfectly well
the acting was top notch by the entire cast but especially by atom that guy is a walking overflowing fountain of talent that just needs a bit of streamlining he managed to show every side of suns personality the odious self centred one desperate one when the realization strucklots of crying involved hes rather bad at it and finally a new man who matured through the experience he actually looked older and calmer and that smile the rest of the cast was just as good the dialogues are delivered lively realistically there is a scene where sun and kyu argue while talking over each other i was stunned by it for the first time in a drama i see a real argument or suns audition scene extraordinary piece of acting some side characters could be deemed annoying but jared the flower shop assistant and the landlady were just quirky and lovable
the music was excellent two songs played during the drama giving subtle hints as to the plot
last but definitely not least the cinematography and set design breathtaking the colours were mostly dulled shades of cold colours so the only visible colour was red there were touches of red all over the place red lamp red flowers red taxi red chair etcetc usually one single item per scene there were also indication throughout the set of the widespread consequences of suns deletions through posters costumes and sets the constant in all those changes is the poster campaign for the new perfume sun did an ad for once the devil which makes watchers wonder if kyu is an angel of the devil the final scene explains that they were both a devil once for each other
the ending is a bit surprising suffice to say it is a happy ending almost perfect kyunot kyu anymore but sky and sun meet on the plane calling each other q they were actually each others q halloween q and cupid q and they saved each others lives i binged it in two days episodes are short and easy to watch if you are fan of slow burn dramas
just one final remark the character of kyu or q reminds me of star trek the next generation character q kyu puts sun through trials by demanding him to erase people in order for sun to learn about himself didnt q do similar thing in star trek just a thought
underrated gem
i dont understand why this series is not talked about more this is art the way it was filmed the message the lessons very shakespearean the male leads are very talented and i feel like they did amazing work with probably not as many resources as some of the big production houses would have done i really enjoyed it and every time i talked about its like it was in no ones radar craptastic series have gotten more love that this amazing story i think that if you have not watched it yet you should give it a chance
a mustwatch to me
soooooo good i almost didnt watch it because of the reviews on here but i think ive learned not to trust this website now cause this has got to be one of the best bl ive seen im sure there were plotholes but overall it felt like so much love was put into the writing of the story and the characters and the pacing felt just right nothing was rushed in the way it often happens when they sideline the plot for the romance love me a fantasy and this really left me satisfied and reminded me of what i love about the genre
yall are haters
what the title says yall are haters
this show deserves a higher review so im leaving this here obviously to each there own but some of yall are just hating on this serious bc yall have brain rot tiktok attention span and hate when bls actually have plot and it isnt just 2 guys kissing
you complain about bls being bad etc but when yall actually have to watch something you asked for its boring
you have the attention span of a rat
stop watching plotless dog shit and watch real shows for once

is this even a bl
this is a repeat on how trailers do be misleading
i am now going unto the seventh episode of this series and i am yet to see a spark or hint of romance between q and sunshine
and is it me or am i the only one that recognizes that rain and sunshine can never get back together
like it is super obvious that everytime sunshine makes every possible person that kinda hinders their relationship disappear rain either forgets he exists move on to another person or never existed or become friends with benefits 
sunshine cant be this dumb to recognise this simple fact 
i guarantee most ppl who watch this is confused as to where the romance is and me too
i would mostly call this a bromance if anything
like is q and sunshine are going to end up together
because i am not seeing anything that hinting that they are going to be together
man it is like i am walking down a long narrow path and it is never ending
like it is so clear sunshine is not the brightest bulb everyone knows this and let me be real
the time when he erased rains ex boyfriend now tell me if this maths is mathsing
so when rain broke up with sunshine he told him that he was in a vulnerable moment when he met sunshine and he needed someone at the time
now note that the peron who made him vulnerable was rains ex
so common sense when he erased rains ex
what do u think will happen 
he would not know sunshine obviously 
because rain would not go to mins bar where he would meet him and he would not vulnerable
at this point he is just randomly choosing ppl to erase
my advice to him even q said it himself move on he is never going to go back to you get it through ur head just imagine he is doing all this stuff  leaving potential dads without their child in ep 2 changing civilization ep 6 etc just for one guy who does not like him anymore
