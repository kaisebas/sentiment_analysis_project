This ep was a bit of a mess.

I had no idea what the conversation was about in the flower shop.

I thought it was just me, phew!ðŸ˜‚ I know they're just not spilling all the beans yet and they're supposed to be mysterious, but those two were speaking in code and I felt stupid lol.

I'm pretty sure Sunshine will wish to erase himself in his last wish.

The last two wishes "killed" Rain and now he forgot him. I'm interested of how this ends but at the same time I felt tricked.

I hoped that through wishes Sunshine would realize that Rain is not for him and he will try to be with Cupid but it's not going to be like that. In fact I feel that this is not really a BL

I understand the feeling tricked part and at first I wanted Sunshine and Q to have a relationship but as we get more into this I don't want that anymore.

The short story that this is based on states that this is not a BL. It really is a story of consequences and letting go told through a queer lens.

To really fix everything he would need to erase Q because that would make it where Q never came and offered wishes in the first place. He would then need to realize he sucks as a BF and either grow up and try to win Rain back or just move on and try to be better to the next person. (Maybe Q is erased as a cupid reaper so he can be reincarnated as a person and they get together?)

This keeps getting darker and darker.

I'm wondering if Sunshine somehow ends up becoming a cupid reaper and has to grant someone else's wishes. That's what it looked like was happening at the end of the preview.

I have no idea how the series will end.

I really love this show. So much nuance and subtlety. Sunshine finally is starting to understand that no wish will bring Rain back. Now what does he do, erase himself, learn to live with it or erase Q? Really looking forward to seeing how this works out.

As Q gets darker we see more of his conflict and emotions in having to fulfill these wishes. It makes me wonder if this his is first time as a cupid reaper or is Sunshine diferent because he reminds Q of Q.
