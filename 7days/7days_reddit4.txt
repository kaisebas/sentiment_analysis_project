This easily comes in my top 2 current on air shows... This ep was so cool... With fights and total reset in their story...sunshine √ó Q ü§°is not possible as of now... Like i can feel that they're curious about each other and have empathy to the point they know that both of them have that sadness in their eyes but still the romance plot is out of the question... Now i want sunshine to move on from Rain ü§°but that's the actual plot.... I hope to see sunshine√óQ and more about Q's past human identity in the upcoming episodes... So far i like this unique concept the idea is really genius for a plotüëç

I am on the fence with a Q and Sunshine pairing. While I don't want Sunshine with Rain as I don't think that would end happily in any universe, I am not sure about Sunshine and Q either. I think that Q must have gone through something similar and failed and perhaps that is how/why he is a Cupid Reaper. Just theorising as I have not read the books or many spoilers.

I am also guessing that successful or not after the 7 wishes Q will move on and I think that may be more painful if they were truly in love. But given the 'if you love it let it go' undercurrent of this series perhaps that will be the ultimate test of whether Sunshine has truly changed. Now I made myself sad and need to go back to a cupcake series to cheer up!

I agree with you... Like sunshine √óQ is impossible (just a shipper's wishü§°)... But I'd also not want Rain√óSunshine too now that it's a reset ... Like Rain √ó and his coworker barista makes a good pair. . I also have a hunch like u.. Like Q either died by suicide falling off from a tall building ü§°or Q made impulsive decisions just like sunshine when he had a cupid reaper that makes him sympathize with the lead to an extent....

Total ho for Supanut's smile
I appreciate that we get a barely dressed Sunshine or Q every episode. Even if I wasn't thoroughly enjoying the plot and characters, that would for sure keep me coming back.

Also, Jet is gorgeous and my love/favorite of the day.

The episode opened with Sunshine in nothing but his boxers for the first 10 minutes. They are giving us what we want.

Jokes on you, I'm into that.
Q coming in with the heat this week. Sunshine is going to need some burn ointment for his ego.


I would totally let Q talk to me like that with a face like his.

I‚Äôm trying to keep my expectations in check because I‚Äôve been hurt before, but this has shot to the top of my list. Atom is nailing it, the series is a conceptual one, leaning heavily on our leads especially Atom but they are carrying it off well.

Like I said not going to get my hopes to high, but I hope more people watch it should get more love.

Side note shout out to Sunshine‚Äôs board, most realistic red string board I‚Äôve ever seen.

I binged the first three episodes earlier this week and was so looking forward to this episode and I wasn't disappointed!

I love the dynamic between Q and Sunshine they are both so damaged and we are not yet sure why.

I share Q's frustration with Sunshine over taking the 'easy' way out. Sunshine just wants what he had and really isn't willing to fight for his and Rain's love. I am beginning to question whether it was love in the first place seeing how they got together, more like companionship and rebounding.

Sunshine will continue to frustrate me and I am a bit terrified of the ending especially knowing the director and his past work. That said, now I have to wait until next week....ugh!

I've decided to watch the series when all the episodes are out. It's impossible to wait one week for each ep T.T

That poetry session came out of nowhere. And the fight was forthcoming. It's nice though. The first meeting story was honestly dragging on a little bit, so that was a nice change of pace.

This was a good episode to understand the characters better although there wasn't much action. Sunshine really is a shallow thinker (but then, I wouldn't want to face with this type of challenge). I wonder if Q is someone from Sunshine's past or past life.
