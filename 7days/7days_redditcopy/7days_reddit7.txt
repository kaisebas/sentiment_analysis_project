I'm very much enjoying this series. I can see how this isn't for eveyrone, it's for sure an expermential series in terms of not only what they're doing with the plot but also filming and the sequencing. I wasn't a fan of Atom's crying in this epsode, think his acting was a little too over the top on cartoon if he'd pulled it in a little more would be better. To be fair he's a new face, and this is a big ask, there's a lot of nuance to this series, and they've layred in the sociatal critiques as well. He's doing a far job of it.

I highly recommend if you are looking for somthing more exestential, very much applud the whole production.

I guess there are three of us enjoying the series! It's different, but I'm here for that. I like that it's a smaller set with a character-driven plot.

Right? I made the mistake of reading the comment section for it on MDL and just about lost my shit. I should know better MDL comment section is toxic as hell.

Theatrical angst. I enjoyed it, but I would enjoy it a lot more if they were kissing while crying üòù.

The shade at series Y though üòÇ. Atom was just out of one!

Making some movement although we still don't have answers about who is Q. Sunshine is learning about the interconnectivity but looking at the preview, he hasn't become any more wise. His family background really breaks my heart, btw. He was traumatized by his parents' abandonment and doesn't have anyone in his life so he's desperately hanging onto Rain.

I am really enjoying this series. The grief coming from Sunshine, while of his own making, was palpable and has started him down a 'redemption(?)' path. I continue to be intrigued by who Q is and his change from light to dark. While they have made some changes from the book if they follow anything I think that the next wish will be the one that really breaks things open. That and we are at episode 8 so the plot needs to plot from here on out. I cannot wait to see how this ends and whether any of them get an HE. At this point, I don't necessarily want any of them together I just want them alive and somewhat changed by the end.

I think that Atom is really doing and excellent job here and was really impressed with his work in this episode.

I'm not sure I want them together, either, but I do hope for some sort of resolution and growth for their characters.

I really am enjoying the series. It's unlike anything else out there.

It really is quite different and I hope that the seeming lack of interest/understanding doesn't deter other creators from tackling unconventional stories in the future. We need our light fluff but also stories like these that challenge and maybe even upset us. I want all the 'colours' of art in this genre.

This ep contributed nothing to the story... But it was all about emotions... That Maxima actress is so talented üëç hope she gets more gigs like this... It was all about crying/angst...i honestly don't blame ‚òÄÔ∏èsunshine that much.. This power of erasing people to make the relationship work is evil in many ways and he has no one /so technically the only solution is erasing Rain's people otherwise the story ends in ep 2 itself... ‚òÄÔ∏èhe finally feels guilty so there is character development and q is helpless too.. The story is complicated now.. Aa the eps go by

The crying scenes were funny in a way but not that bad too I've seen worse... Atom is truly talented... I can't help but think they're laughing when they show teeth whenever they're cryingü§°i know it is to show their pain but ü§ìit's common in films/series i guess

Jokes on you, I'm into that.
I'm so glad that Sunshine did a reading of MacBeth, because it fits his character perfectly for this episode. I was wondering what they were doing a reading of and hoped it was this before Maxima even started speaking. As soon as she started to speak, I was internally clapping for this brilliant decision by the writer/production team.

This is the show that I look forward to the most every week. The emotional meltdown was really well done and that cold read had me on the edge of my seat. Hope more folks start watching!

This whole show is a train wreck to me. The over the top acting from Atom is getting on my nerves. The reaper dude is carrying this whole show. I don't like the boyfriend either. He really has no good qualities as a character, I don't know what Atom's character likes about him. I am forcing myself to finish this because the premise was in my wheelhouse. I am hoping it gets better, somehow.
