damn i guess wetv is getting hammered it wont load for me at all like it plays the ads b4 the show and then goes to a black screen 
eta finally got it to load really cute ending im glad
and thanks for sticking w my first onair 


im dying to get home and watch


in my villain era
i like this because it is so unique is this a bl no its really not the author was upfront about that the novella is a character study for sunshine it a faustian tale where the lead happens to have a boyfriend but it really has no bearing on the rest of the plot it could have been female or male it makes no difference really
this was an arthouse piece its a stage play in a series and i absolutely applaud the whole team and their work especially atom and jet this whole production hinged on them and they put in a solid performance adapting this particular novella was ambitious but i think the director was looking for the challenge they arent pinning it on fan service
i absolutely think this is worth a watch its not going to be for everyone and the ending is an openambiguous one but if your like me and a fan of the offbeat and outside the norm this will for sure be right up your alley
thanks for hosting uimomen


cause of death the heart killers 
this was really something special i loved how it was a more reflexive work ive been telling people this should be adapted into a play i think it would work wonderfully it was a nice wrap up for sunshines story and i just wish we could get a little more of sun and sky in their happy place


okay someone smarter than me please help me with understanding this
they both called each other q at the end so is q basically the role of the reaper was sunshine the reaper when q had to choose the candles or was sunshine the last candle that he saved but then why did he call him q q was the one who wished sunshine back into the world right were things running in parallel timelines so that was when q relit the last candle
at the end sunshine has all his memories of q but q does not correct how did he get put back in the world when sunshine wished he was erased or was it because he wished q the role was erased so guy was able to be himself and then the telepathy at the end wasnt telepathy right they were showing a conversation that they were going to have

pretty much i think sunshine was both the reaper and the last candle like how sunshine chose to use his erasing power to erase his q guy also chose to use his saving power to save his q perhaps unknowingly
but also dont overthink this its magic

from what i understood from the book was that because both loved each other they stopped each other from becoming q by being q in each others realities



for me id easily give it 910 the story wow so cool kudos to the author for creating this masterpiece and the director for embodying it with added elementsi deduct 1 point 5 for slow paced scenes at times and longer scenes but those elements made me love this show too and  5 for not giving more of q nd sunshine and more of skys flashbackwith his q which is the second book i guess
also jared mentioning his love for grandma is a type of love maybe emphasized that sunshine was a cupid reaper playing cupid for the fatherson bond love between the son sky and his dying dad paternal love with candles maybe to symbolize death
hows sky alive did sun as q pray for him after he k worded himself drowning in the river from the shadow of skys q im 100 sure that it was sun maybe they both beggedprayed to save each other when they messed up other peoples lives and somehow redeemed their mistakescorrected their lives  both sunsky killed themselves out of pressure tho somehow theyre back to life because of their qssecond chance 
sunshineearthair convo was mature and sunshinesky reunion was the cutest  i really loved the pair somehow their visuals are refreshing and gives off that mature couple vibes very different from traditional bl couples
loved the seriesgoodbye 7 days before valentine


it was refreshing to watch something very different and im glad i came back to it after falling behind for a few weeks by the end i was very emotionally invested i even started crying as soon as that song played even before we knew sunshine was crying loved sunshines development and so happy to see where he ended up

and how cute that theyre sky and sunshine 2gether 4ever

i mean i get why the finale is the way it is narratively but still its kind of boring sure sure hes a changed man now find your guy and kiss already
the final scene is super cute though though it sure feels like they ran out of budget at the very end  but ill take it


i havent watched any episodes but im now just realizing the title is not fooling around


okay i watched it and i liked the ending there were some plot holes and some sloppy writing but overall i really enjoyed it


was there anything to the airport scene and the two little boys and how the camera focuses on the remaining boy after sunshine walks by or was it just filler for the voiceover


does anyone know the name of the song at the end
