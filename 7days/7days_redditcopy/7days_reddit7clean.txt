im very much enjoying this series i can see how this isnt for eveyrone its for sure an expermential series in terms of not only what theyre doing with the plot but also filming and the sequencing i wasnt a fan of atoms crying in this epsode think his acting was a little too over the top on cartoon if hed pulled it in a little more would be better to be fair hes a new face and this is a big ask theres a lot of nuance to this series and theyve layred in the sociatal critiques as well hes doing a far job of it
i highly recommend if you are looking for somthing more exestential very much applud the whole production


i guess there are three of us enjoying the series its different but im here for that i like that its a smaller set with a characterdriven plot


in my villain era
right i made the mistake of reading the comment section for it on mdl and just about lost my shit i should know better mdl comment section is toxic as hell

whenever someone comments that like 5 people are keeping up w this show it sends me into orbit


good orbit or bad orbit i wish there were more of us


upvote count is up to 15 go to twitter if you have it  post screenshots i havent since winter break ive been floating in nonscheduled bliss but will get back to it

theatrical angst i enjoyed it but i would enjoy it a lot more if they were kissing while crying 
the shade at series y though  atom was just out of one


making some movement although we still dont have answers about who is q sunshine is learning about the interconnectivity but looking at the preview he hasnt become any more wise his family background really breaks my heart btw he was traumatized by his parents abandonment and doesnt have anyone in his life so hes desperately hanging onto rain


i am really enjoying this series the grief coming from sunshine while of his own making was palpable and has started him down a redemption path i continue to be intrigued by who q is and his change from light to dark while they have made some changes from the book if they follow anything i think that the next wish will be the one that really breaks things open that and we are at episode 8 so the plot needs to plot from here on out i cannot wait to see how this ends and whether any of them get an he at this point i dont necessarily want any of them together i just want them alive and somewhat changed by the end
i think that atom is really doing and excellent job here and was really impressed with his work in this episode


im not sure i want them together either but i do hope for some sort of resolution and growth for their characters
i really am enjoying the series its unlike anything else out there


it really is quite different and i hope that the seeming lack of interestunderstanding doesnt deter other creators from tackling unconventional stories in the future we need our light fluff but also stories like these that challenge and maybe even upset us i want all the colours of art in this genre



this ep contributed nothing to the story but it was all about emotions that maxima actress is so talented  hope she gets more gigs like this it was all about cryingangsti honestly dont blame sunshine that much this power of erasing people to make the relationship work is evil in many ways and he has no one so technically the only solution is erasing rains people otherwise the story ends in ep 2 itself he finally feels guilty so there is character development and q is helpless too the story is complicated now aa the eps go by
the crying scenes were funny in a way but not that bad too ive seen worse atom is truly talented i cant help but think theyre laughing when they show teeth whenever theyre cryingi know it is to show their pain but its common in filmsseries i guess

jokes on you im into that
im so glad that sunshine did a reading of macbeth because it fits his character perfectly for this episode i was wondering what they were doing a reading of and hoped it was this before maxima even started speaking as soon as she started to speak i was internally clapping for this brilliant decision by the writerproduction team


this is the show that i look forward to the most every week the emotional meltdown was really well done and that cold read had me on the edge of my seat hope more folks start watching


this whole show is a train wreck to me the over the top acting from atom is getting on my nerves the reaper dude is carrying this whole show i dont like the boyfriend either he really has no good qualities as a character i dont know what atoms character likes about him i am forcing myself to finish this because the premise was in my wheelhouse i am hoping it gets better somehow

i got lost in the holiday shuffle with all my kids and christmas caught up last week and am about to sit down for this episode now
