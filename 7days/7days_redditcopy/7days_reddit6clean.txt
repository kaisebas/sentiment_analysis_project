to me this is starting to drag theres no real growth in sunshines character or how he interacts with q so it feels like theyre just running in circle though i guess he himself also feels like hes running in circle


i feel the same the premise is so interesting and then it gets old so fast i need to see some regret or remorse or realization or something from sunshine he just seems like a soulless ass that no good person should ever be stuck with

absolutely the only thing he regrets is trusting q over and over again lmao his character has no growth he still only blames q for the decisions he made himself


the only logical way for him to fix the mess he is in now is to make the last person to vanish q if q didnt exist none of the things happen and sunshine can try to redeem himself and that just feels pointless i dont get the direction this is supposed to go in unless hes suppose to fall for q  maybe wish for the person that made him a cupid reaper to disappear that feels like a stretch maybe just realize hes an ass and move on and find someone else


youre right i thought that with time sunshine would realize the wrong in his ways but no every time he wishes something he screws it even more
considering that rain and him got to know each other thanks to rain going to meens club theyre probably strangers in this timeline or much worse without meen maybe rain killed himself
i thought sunshine and q would have sexy moments or at least some attraction but no sunshine is obsessed with rain and q is just sneaky

i had the exact same thoughts while watching the episode 

jokes on you im into that
poor q stuck with sunshine that seems to be immune to learning absolutely any life lessons from any of these erases its okay q we all understand your frustrations
not from this episode

i loved that scene and i hate how sunshine didnt learn anything from it ugh they just went back to the plan as usual its starting to get on my nerves tbh


i really do love this show so much atom is killing it that being said sunshine really needs to learn the lesson staring him in the face erasing the best friend was so stupid and qs reaction was spot on i understand that sunshine has no friends and therefore doesnt understand the implications and that he only thinks about himself but at somepoint he has to think about hot it will impact rain as that is supposed to be his ultimate goal
next week seems to be a realisation about what he has been doing but i am not convinced that sunshine will take any responsibility poor q stuck there with him till the end i would have gone to my employer and asked for a new assingmentcomment image


from the trailer i have a hunch that q disappears atlast i hope that doesnt happen didnt read the novel yet  so far i think its bromance between qsunshine  lets see how this goes 3 more nights until valentine

ugh at this point i only care about q and his backstory sunshine is annoying af  hes not understanding it at all it so frustratingly slow too

for me this show is what you get when the movie ground hogs day plays fuck around and find out with be careful what you wish for i agree with other comments complimenting atoms performance the boy deserves better storylines when i watched ep 4 i thought it was turning into a classic morality play but insight evaded atom once again so here we are hoping for something meaningful or at least sexy between the cupid reaper and atom appears pointless at this stage so my question is just where is the boys love
