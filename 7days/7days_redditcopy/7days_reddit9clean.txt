theory flower boy is the head guy and all those flowers he is naming are real people that all erased themselvesgot erased


in my villain era
atom nailed it this episode he was loosing me last two i felt he was a little over the top but this episode he nailed it i am surprised by how quick the series is moving this is what happens in the novella but i didnt think itd be so early maybe well get some romance

is it just me or the sexual tension is amping up even though im pretty sure that is going nowhere
3 more episodes what now the preview is entering an epilogue territory but 3 episodes are way too long for that

is it just me or the sexual tension is amping up even though im pretty sure that is going nowhere
lmao youve basically just summed up 180 degree longitude passes through us so


lmao youve basically just summed up 180 degree longitude passes through us so
that is so horribly correct dammit


i saw that coming but i thought it would be the dreaded 11th episode when it happened not the 9th now where does the story go im hooked like a tuna
and yes the sexual tension has been dialed up to 11 but theres nowhere for it to go


that song that keeps getting played by the busker in the park is a banger dont suppose anyone knows the titleartist

i assumed they just did it for the series i have no idea but i love it and need it in my playlist pls update if you find it 

when flower shop guy said q came from the past to the future specifically to help sun i thought they were going to pull some shit like hes his dad from the past or something and was preparing myself to be grossed out by the almostkiss but safe for another week i guess
i normally hate this kind of indie show but i really want to know what happens in the end

okay so theory please tell me if this was obvious and everyone already thought of this but i just finished binging all 9 eps q was suns last lover and q ereased himself so he chose him so they could get back together
btw i love this series sooo much like  its a 810 from me

this is actually an interesting theory because iirc sunshine said rain was his first bf which honestly doesnt track w how hot and outgoing sunshine is  but if his exbf was erased of course sunshine wouldnt remember him
