this easily comes in my top 2 current on air shows this ep was so cool with fights and total reset in their storysunshine  q is not possible as of now like i can feel that theyre curious about each other and have empathy to the point they know that both of them have that sadness in their eyes but still the romance plot is out of the question now i want sunshine to move on from rain but thats the actual plot i hope to see sunshineq and more about qs past human identity in the upcoming episodes so far i like this unique concept the idea is really genius for a plot


i am on the fence with a q and sunshine pairing while i dont want sunshine with rain as i dont think that would end happily in any universe i am not sure about sunshine and q either i think that q must have gone through something similar and failed and perhaps that is howwhy he is a cupid reaper just theorising as i have not read the books or many spoilers
i am also guessing that successful or not after the 7 wishes q will move on and i think that may be more painful if they were truly in love but given the if you love it let it go undercurrent of this series perhaps that will be the ultimate test of whether sunshine has truly changed now i made myself sad and need to go back to a cupcake series to cheer up


i agree with you like sunshine q is impossible just a shippers wish but id also not want rainsunshine too now that its a reset  like rain  and his coworker barista makes a good pair  i also have a hunch like u like q either died by suicide falling off from a tall building or q made impulsive decisions just like sunshine when he had a cupid reaper that makes him sympathize with the lead to an extent

now i want sunshine to move on from rain
spill the fucking tea like hello lol

total ho for supanuts smile
i appreciate that we get a barely dressed sunshine or q every episode even if i wasnt thoroughly enjoying the plot and characters that would for sure keep me coming back
also jet is gorgeous and my lovefavorite of the day


the episode opened with sunshine in nothing but his boxers for the first 10 minutes they are giving us what we want

jokes on you im into that
q coming in with the heat this week sunshine is going to need some burn ointment for his ego
i would totally let q talk to me like that with a face like his


in my villain era
im trying to keep my expectations in check because ive been hurt before but this has shot to the top of my list atom is nailing it the series is a conceptual one leaning heavily on our leads especially atom but they are carrying it off well
like i said not going to get my hopes to high but i hope more people watch it should get more love
side note shout out to sunshines board most realistic red string board ive ever seen

this series is deeeeep and hello to all my anxieties about people not wanting to be with me coming to the surface
this is wrestling with really hard questions bc as q says life is hard
wowowow


hows the series i have the novel but have yet to begin reading it

its really good tbh im digging it so far even tho after the jackjoker teaser dropped i lost interest in all other shows lmao


just watched the first episode not sure i like it tho but ill continue with the second episode lol


if possible  if u read the whole thing  can u spoil the story please


my reading list is quite lengthy so i doubt it will happen any time soon lol but once ive read it ill inbox you though it may be too late


i binged the first three episodes earlier this week and was so looking forward to this episode and i wasnt disappointed
i love the dynamic between q and sunshine they are both so damaged and we are not yet sure why
i share qs frustration with sunshine over taking the easy way out sunshine just wants what he had and really isnt willing to fight for his and rains love i am beginning to question whether it was love in the first place seeing how they got together more like companionship and rebounding
sunshine will continue to frustrate me and i am a bit terrified of the ending especially knowing the director and his past work that said now i have to wait until next weekugh

ive decided to watch the series when all the episodes are out its impossible to wait one week for each ep tt

that poetry session came out of nowhere and the fight was forthcoming its nice though the first meeting story was honestly dragging on a little bit so that was a nice change of pace


this was a good episode to understand the characters better although there wasnt much action sunshine really is a shallow thinker but then i wouldnt want to face with this type of challenge i wonder if q is someone from sunshines past or past life
