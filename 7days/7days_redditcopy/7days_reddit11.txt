Ok, this is how you make an 11 episode. THIS. IS IT.

GOD THIS HURT. But it was SO SO GOOD.

I'm gonna be digesting this series for the next 2 to 3 months because there's so much allegories that I've only scraped the surface. That kiss!!! They gave their all. I'm just so happy but still so sad. What is this sorcery???

BRO Q'S ACTING REALLY GOT TO ME THIS EPISODE!! 😭😭😭 Also, why didn't Sun erase the candle guy so that the Q is still alive and bro could just go and find him and obv over him all again....but regardless, THE VIDEOGRAPHY AND NARRATION IS SO EXCELLENT THAT I CANT DO ITTTT

I don't think that would've made difference tho... Even the candle guy has higher officials he's answerable for.. And nobody knows who's the final authority(God) even the candle guy(mentioned in previous ep when Q wanted to help sunshine by asking that candle guy...also Q always avoided flower shop when even sunshine invited him to go together ..Q was hiding his connection to the flower shop so sunshine must've missed that clue)

... And if q exists he'll have to be cupid reaper for so many people (repetitive process)... So sunshine just wants him to be truly happy/free from his punishment... And that can only happen if he disappears not his soul but as a cupid reaper🥺

Bro if I'm not wrong, he once erased saying, I want to erase the person who is responsible for me not being together with rain. By that logic, he could've just said, I want to erase the person who is the reason for this whole thing. But then again, there's no plot if it goes that way so I get your point too

FINALLY (so worth it)

I knew it! 100% they are pulling on 7 Days Before Halloween, I don't think it's actually been written yet but the author said the story continued in it and as they are the writer.

I'm wildly curious how they are going to end it, the novel has an open ending, and I'm anticipating somthing similar.

7 Days Before Valentines is seriously underrated and I wish it had an international release!

This episode is probably the best of them all. Such an emotional episode. We have seen the dead parents trope before, but it was cool how they worked the occult and supernatural aspects into it.

I have to give dudes props for the acting in this one. They both had me on the verge of tears with their acting. This series started off kind of small and kind of messy, but it has now become "art", and is tackling all kinds of human conditions, and philosophies.

I hope to see these actors working together again, and whoever the woman is singing the themesong, she has to do the theme for their next project. For real...so beautifully voiced!

i feel like it sort of has to end happily, at this point? Like, Sunshine has to run into regular human Q or something at the end. It makes no sense to me that this story wouldn't end on some romantic note ESPECIALLY because they kissed. Gag! 🙌😩 I don't see why they would bother to yank at that string (that everyone saw there!!!!) only to leave everyone on read. lol At first I thought 7 Days would be a 180 Degree Longitude Passes Through Us situation, but Sunshine and Q kissed so that completely changes the game.

tbh, I'm expecting a happy/romantic ending, but if we drive off a cliff I also won't be surprised. lol

😂🤣😂🤣 I mean, I hope they live hea together but at the same time, a bittersweet or open ending would be superb, to me. Not to raise more controversy but I don't want an ending à la Last Twilight, where everybody is super happy and the problems just disappear🫢

7 Days doesn't really have all the issues Last Twilight had. Like the main thing here was that Sunshine was dumped and couldn't deal with it, and through trials and tribulations he's come out the other side 7 days later. It's basically like nothing has happened because deleting himself reset everything. So, Sunshine finding love in someone else after everything would make sense and it wouldn't just be problems disappearing, etc.

but who knows. lol

I waited a week just to watch this ep along with the final ep and ugh my feels they finally kissed but ugggh 😭 I knew he'd wish him away 😭

I expected this to happen tbh I predicted that Q drowned a while back he kept looking at the water and the bathtub scenes too. His story was so sad, ugh my heart hurts. 💔

I'm off to watch the finale ep now 🤞🏻
