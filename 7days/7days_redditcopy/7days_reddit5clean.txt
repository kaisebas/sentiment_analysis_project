how did i not realize that sunshine was also the guy in bake me please
such a cutie

jokes on you im into that
whelp i just learnt that the novel is available on kindle unlimited and now i know what im going to be doing for the next couple of days

well this is definitely interesting not sure what else he could learn now i feel like eventually hell have to admit that he himself is the problem and then what


aaah what is with love rebirthhorrific dark pastaka death and that fortune teller asks q to fall in love my ship is sailing aaaaaahh love it beginning of the ep they were sharing their miseries and wow there is tension qsunshine probable end game rain and sun are not compatible at all sunshine let go of him boyrain tolerates u thats it
i kinda relate to sunshine as a person who does not care that much about politics and the aftermath sheesh what in the north korea was that


i really liked this episode with the fortune teller and learning more about sunshines parents they are now on the list for worst parents especially the mom
the backstory with the politician and commentary on equality in general and marriage equality specifically was great sunshines behaviour and expressions during that whole scene just highlight how narcissistic he is i understand not being into politics but this was important to rain and he didnt take the time to understand why again i come bak to the conclusion that he doesnt really love rain
as an aside i read the book today it is a short and easy read i wont spoil it but i can say there is a lot more depth to the characters in the series although sunshine is a bit more aware in the book than we see in the show


checking in is there any actual bl in this series or is it like 180 without an actual romance

lmao yes there is we even got some sunshinerain kissies last episode but you can tell the director has a theatre background because much like w 180 degrees theres a lot of 2 characters talking in empty space sort of scenes and monologues im still 80 sure sunshine and q are endgame



much like w 180 degrees theres a lot of 2 characters talking in empty space sort of scenes and monologues
i put up with a lot of this and honestly didnt mind it at first in 180 because they gave me abs and clavicles and nakedness but if no one is making out pre or post these monologues and empty spaces it gets to be bangxiety and i cant do that

theres actually a lot of nakedness in this there was an entire scene w our cute reaper wet and out of the tub talking with sunshine and i think its in atoms contract to be shirtlessin his underwear every episode


oh good yay thats a good sign thank you hopefully someone will make use of his nakedness soon 

hes not naked at all in bake me pls so i am happy to see it here lol 


there is a bl plot and subplots too i cant say they show much about the lead couples story  but it shows more about rain and his exs and how the lead erases people to bond with rain again


thank you so no making out so far



there are scenes with kisses but still i have no clue whether there is going to be a love triangle or who are the lead couple




in my villain era
lol its not a romance thoughts the author even says that in the preface of the novella its more about understading that our choices have far reaching consequences and trying to put our own selfish wants above those we thought we loved only hurts ourselves and others in the end




in my villain era
apparently the story continues in 7 days before halloween but i cant find that one


why cant this dude be preachy all he wants but also give us boys loving each other and making out  why does he hate happy things


in my villain era
im happy atom is getting something other then bake me to his acting credit


very true


sunshine is kind of a brat how long before he realises hes the problem cupid and rain deserve better lmao also if rain didnt rememberknow who sunshine was in the previous episode how come the landlady was asking about him am i on crack
