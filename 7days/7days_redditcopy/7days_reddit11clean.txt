ok this is how you make an 11 episode this is it
god this hurt but it was so so good
im gonna be digesting this series for the next 2 to 3 months because theres so much allegories that ive only scraped the surface that kiss they gave their all im just so happy but still so sad what is this sorcery

omfg 


was it sunshines candle gahhhh


cause of death the heart killers 
do we know for sure thats sunshines name on the candle i want to believe since i know no thai


we dont know but they have to have some prior connectionright


cause of death the heart killers 
right then believe we will 


wait is this show finale gonna air exactly 7 days before valentine 


bro qs acting really got to me this episode  also why didnt sun erase the candle guy so that the q is still alive and bro could just go and find him and obv over him all againbut regardless the videography and narration is so excellent that i cant do itttt


i dont think that wouldve made difference tho even the candle guy has higher officials hes answerable for and nobody knows whos the final authoritygod even the candle guymentioned in previous ep when q wanted to help sunshine by asking that candle guyalso q always avoided flower shop when even sunshine invited him to go together q was hiding his connection to the flower shop so sunshine mustve missed that clue
 and if q exists hell have to be cupid reaper for so many people repetitive process so sunshine just wants him to be truly happyfree from his punishment and that can only happen if he disappears not his soul but as a cupid reaper


bro if im not wrong he once erased saying i want to erase the person who is responsible for me not being together with rain by that logic he couldve just said i want to erase the person who is the reason for this whole thing but then again theres no plot if it goes that way so i get your point too


somebody hold me i am not okay 


in my villain era
finally so worth it
i knew it 100 they are pulling on 7 days before halloween i dont think its actually been written yet but the author said the story continued in it and as they are the writer
im wildly curious how they are going to end it the novel has an open ending and im anticipating somthing similar

7 days before valentines is seriously underrated and i wish it had an international release


this episode is probably the best of them all such an emotional episode we have seen the dead parents trope before but it was cool how they worked the occult and supernatural aspects into it
i have to give dudes props for the acting in this one they both had me on the verge of tears with their acting this series started off kind of small and kind of messy but it has now become art and is tackling all kinds of human conditions and philosophies
i hope to see these actors working together again and whoever the woman is singing the themesong she has to do the theme for their next project for realso beautifully voiced


this series is deep in philosophy and q my boiii i understand u  this series really is memorable and i can never forget this the story is so perfect tooo kudos to the authoractorsscreenwriterand finally thatbut it was in the last scene this series really got me feeling so many emotionssunshineq i hope there is a plot twist in the last ep manifesting itthis ep was perfect


this is great and part of me doesnt want a happily ever after ending it wouldnt be right yknow

i feel like it sort of has to end happily at this point like sunshine has to run into regular human q or something at the end it makes no sense to me that this story wouldnt end on some romantic note especially because they kissed gag  i dont see why they would bother to yank at that string that everyone saw there only to leave everyone on read lol at first i thought 7 days would be a 180 degree longitude passes through us situation but sunshine and q kissed so that completely changes the game
tbh im expecting a happyromantic ending but if we drive off a cliff i also wont be surprised lol


 i mean i hope they live hea together but at the same time a bittersweet or open ending would be superb to me not to raise more controversy but i dont want an ending  la last twilight where everybody is super happy and the problems just disappear

7 days doesnt really have all the issues last twilight had like the main thing here was that sunshine was dumped and couldnt deal with it and through trials and tribulations hes come out the other side 7 days later its basically like nothing has happened because deleting himself reset everything so sunshine finding love in someone else after everything would make sense and it wouldnt just be problems disappearing etc
but who knows lol

i waited a week just to watch this ep along with the final ep and ugh my feels they finally kissed but ugggh  i knew hed wish him away 
i expected this to happen tbh i predicted that q drowned a while back he kept looking at the water and the bathtub scenes too his story was so sad ugh my heart hurts 
im off to watch the finale ep now
