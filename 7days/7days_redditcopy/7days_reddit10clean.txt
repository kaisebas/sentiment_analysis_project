me this whole episode

im saying



this is so good who saved sun did that person make an erase wish and somehow they ended up saving him we know very little about q the wishes and the rules and thats a bit frustrating but it makes sense if they want to keep it intriguing till the end of the show
and qs past sounds so painful


i like your theory about an erase wish from someone else bringing him back my immediate thought was that since q won his prize was a wish that he would have used to free himself from being a reaper but used on sunshine instead since q made the comment that he didnt know what he would receive if he won
i think qs past will be very painful and so sunshine will use his last wish to erase q to free him from the suffering or maybe get creative and erase cupid reaper which would free him


i honestly wish we could have focused on q instead like sunshine no sunshine should have been one episode person that he grants 3 wishes and moves on to the next lol


what if it was rain from another timeline that wished q back what if rain is the one in that universe who has a reaper visiting him

just kiss already sorry i cant focus on the plot while these two decidedly choose to not kiss all i get from this episode is the bedroom eyes

god i was screaming for a kiss   i hope these two can get another drama together bc the chemistry is so good with them i cant 


someone suggested that q and sunshine were intertwined in the past  maybe q erased sunshine at some point q definitely seems like a person in love

in the last episode q definitely was giving desperate for sunshine to kiss him and disappointed when it didnt happen during their almostkiss


does the sunshine was erased theory also dovetail with his personal narrative of being deserted by everyone i dont have the brain capacity to think that through

crying bc they didnt kiss despite looking like that at each other the whole time and literally going a date  imma yeet myself into the sun fr



special appreciation to the actor that plays q wow hes so handsome and cute when he smiles
this ep is like a bromance but a delulu person like me interprets it as romance  finally sunshine be like rain is not worth it after all his shenaniganshe didnt even bother to greettalk to him lol when they touch the rosesfaces and give roses waah as a qsunshine shipper i loved it and when their faces inch closer and closer i wanted to push their faces together and make them kiss also loved how sunshine talked about universeppl that was a new perspective that was relatable this felt like filling up ep 10 except for sunshines revivalrealizing his mistakeit did not add much to the story still love this series and also this epi loved their eye contactsdates it was a happy ep overall
next weeks preview seems interesting 


this series really surprised me with how deep it is initially it was kind of a mess but as the series progressed the narrative and especially the performances have really opened up in a major way i absolutely love atom and jet sunshine and qiu together they work off each other so well i am praying that they get to work together in the future whether they get together or not in the end their interactions have been absolutely beautiful and poignant
being a geek the supernatural aspect of this series had me hooked as soon as they kicked in i love the idea of multiverses and alternate timelines i also love the idea of demons and angels manipulating mankind this so far is one of my favorite series of 2023
