me this whole episode

im saying



this is so good who saved sun did that person make an erase wish and somehow they ended up saving him we know very little about q the wishes and the rules and thats a bit frustrating but it makes sense if they want to keep it intriguing till the end of the show
and qs past sounds so painful


i like your theory about an erase wish from someone else bringing him back my immediate thought was that since q won his prize was a wish that he would have used to free himself from being a reaper but used on sunshine instead since q made the comment that he didnt know what he would receive if he won
i think qs past will be very painful and so sunshine will use his last wish to erase q to free him from the suffering or maybe get creative and erase cupid reaper which would free him


i honestly wish we could have focused on q instead like sunshine no sunshine should have been one episode person that he grants 3 wishes and moves on to the next lol


what if it was rain from another timeline that wished q back what if rain is the one in that universe who has a reaper visiting him

just kiss already sorry i cant focus on the plot while these two decidedly choose to not kiss all i get from this episode is the bedroom eyes

god i was screaming for a kiss   i hope these two can get another drama together bc the chemistry is so good with them i cant 


someone suggested that q and sunshine were intertwined in the past  maybe q erased sunshine at some point q definitely seems like a person in love

in the last episode q definitely was giving desperate for sunshine to kiss him and disappointed when it didnt happen during their almostkiss


does the sunshine was erased theory also dovetail with his personal narrative of being deserted by everyone i dont have the brain capacity to think that through

crying bc they didnt kiss despite looking like that at each other the whole time and literally going a date  imma yeet myself into the sun fr



special appreciation to the actor that plays q wow hes so handsome and cute when he smiles
this ep is like a bromance but a delulu person like me interprets it as romance  finally sunshine be like rain is not worth it after all his shenaniganshe didnt even bother to greettalk to him lol when they touch the rosesfaces and give roses waah as a qsunshine shipper i loved it and when their faces inch closer and closer i wanted to push their faces together and make them kiss also loved how sunshine talked about universeppl that was a new perspective that was relatable this felt like filling up ep 10 except for sunshines revivalrealizing his mistakeit did not add much to the story still love this series and also this epi loved their eye contactsdates it was a happy ep overall
next weeks preview seems interesting 


this series really surprised me with how deep it is initially it was kind of a mess but as the series progressed the narrative and especially the performances have really opened up in a major way i absolutely love atom and jet sunshine and qiu together they work off each other so well i am praying that they get to work together in the future whether they get together or not in the end their interactions have been absolutely beautiful and poignant
being a geek the supernatural aspect of this series had me hooked as soon as they kicked in i love the idea of multiverses and alternate timelines i also love the idea of demons and angels manipulating mankind this so far is one of my favorite series of 2023ok this is how you make an 11 episode this is it
god this hurt but it was so so good
im gonna be digesting this series for the next 2 to 3 months because theres so much allegories that ive only scraped the surface that kiss they gave their all im just so happy but still so sad what is this sorcery

omfg 


was it sunshines candle gahhhh


cause of death the heart killers 
do we know for sure thats sunshines name on the candle i want to believe since i know no thai


we dont know but they have to have some prior connectionright


cause of death the heart killers 
right then believe we will 


wait is this show finale gonna air exactly 7 days before valentine 


bro qs acting really got to me this episode  also why didnt sun erase the candle guy so that the q is still alive and bro could just go and find him and obv over him all againbut regardless the videography and narration is so excellent that i cant do itttt


i dont think that wouldve made difference tho even the candle guy has higher officials hes answerable for and nobody knows whos the final authoritygod even the candle guymentioned in previous ep when q wanted to help sunshine by asking that candle guyalso q always avoided flower shop when even sunshine invited him to go together q was hiding his connection to the flower shop so sunshine mustve missed that clue
 and if q exists hell have to be cupid reaper for so many people repetitive process so sunshine just wants him to be truly happyfree from his punishment and that can only happen if he disappears not his soul but as a cupid reaper


bro if im not wrong he once erased saying i want to erase the person who is responsible for me not being together with rain by that logic he couldve just said i want to erase the person who is the reason for this whole thing but then again theres no plot if it goes that way so i get your point too


somebody hold me i am not okay 


in my villain era
finally so worth it
i knew it 100 they are pulling on 7 days before halloween i dont think its actually been written yet but the author said the story continued in it and as they are the writer
im wildly curious how they are going to end it the novel has an open ending and im anticipating somthing similar

7 days before valentines is seriously underrated and i wish it had an international release


this episode is probably the best of them all such an emotional episode we have seen the dead parents trope before but it was cool how they worked the occult and supernatural aspects into it
i have to give dudes props for the acting in this one they both had me on the verge of tears with their acting this series started off kind of small and kind of messy but it has now become art and is tackling all kinds of human conditions and philosophies
i hope to see these actors working together again and whoever the woman is singing the themesong she has to do the theme for their next project for realso beautifully voiced


this series is deep in philosophy and q my boiii i understand u  this series really is memorable and i can never forget this the story is so perfect tooo kudos to the authoractorsscreenwriterand finally thatbut it was in the last scene this series really got me feeling so many emotionssunshineq i hope there is a plot twist in the last ep manifesting itthis ep was perfect


this is great and part of me doesnt want a happily ever after ending it wouldnt be right yknow

i feel like it sort of has to end happily at this point like sunshine has to run into regular human q or something at the end it makes no sense to me that this story wouldnt end on some romantic note especially because they kissed gag  i dont see why they would bother to yank at that string that everyone saw there only to leave everyone on read lol at first i thought 7 days would be a 180 degree longitude passes through us situation but sunshine and q kissed so that completely changes the game
tbh im expecting a happyromantic ending but if we drive off a cliff i also wont be surprised lol


 i mean i hope they live hea together but at the same time a bittersweet or open ending would be superb to me not to raise more controversy but i dont want an ending  la last twilight where everybody is super happy and the problems just disappear

7 days doesnt really have all the issues last twilight had like the main thing here was that sunshine was dumped and couldnt deal with it and through trials and tribulations hes come out the other side 7 days later its basically like nothing has happened because deleting himself reset everything so sunshine finding love in someone else after everything would make sense and it wouldnt just be problems disappearing etc
but who knows lol

i waited a week just to watch this ep along with the final ep and ugh my feels they finally kissed but ugggh  i knew hed wish him away 
i expected this to happen tbh i predicted that q drowned a while back he kept looking at the water and the bathtub scenes too his story was so sad ugh my heart hurts 
im off to watch the finale ep now damn i guess wetv is getting hammered it wont load for me at all like it plays the ads b4 the show and then goes to a black screen 
eta finally got it to load really cute ending im glad
and thanks for sticking w my first onair 


im dying to get home and watch


in my villain era
i like this because it is so unique is this a bl no its really not the author was upfront about that the novella is a character study for sunshine it a faustian tale where the lead happens to have a boyfriend but it really has no bearing on the rest of the plot it could have been female or male it makes no difference really
this was an arthouse piece its a stage play in a series and i absolutely applaud the whole team and their work especially atom and jet this whole production hinged on them and they put in a solid performance adapting this particular novella was ambitious but i think the director was looking for the challenge they arent pinning it on fan service
i absolutely think this is worth a watch its not going to be for everyone and the ending is an openambiguous one but if your like me and a fan of the offbeat and outside the norm this will for sure be right up your alley
thanks for hosting uimomen


cause of death the heart killers 
this was really something special i loved how it was a more reflexive work ive been telling people this should be adapted into a play i think it would work wonderfully it was a nice wrap up for sunshines story and i just wish we could get a little more of sun and sky in their happy place


okay someone smarter than me please help me with understanding this
they both called each other q at the end so is q basically the role of the reaper was sunshine the reaper when q had to choose the candles or was sunshine the last candle that he saved but then why did he call him q q was the one who wished sunshine back into the world right were things running in parallel timelines so that was when q relit the last candle
at the end sunshine has all his memories of q but q does not correct how did he get put back in the world when sunshine wished he was erased or was it because he wished q the role was erased so guy was able to be himself and then the telepathy at the end wasnt telepathy right they were showing a conversation that they were going to have

pretty much i think sunshine was both the reaper and the last candle like how sunshine chose to use his erasing power to erase his q guy also chose to use his saving power to save his q perhaps unknowingly
but also dont overthink this its magic

from what i understood from the book was that because both loved each other they stopped each other from becoming q by being q in each others realities



for me id easily give it 910 the story wow so cool kudos to the author for creating this masterpiece and the director for embodying it with added elementsi deduct 1 point 5 for slow paced scenes at times and longer scenes but those elements made me love this show too and  5 for not giving more of q nd sunshine and more of skys flashbackwith his q which is the second book i guess
also jared mentioning his love for grandma is a type of love maybe emphasized that sunshine was a cupid reaper playing cupid for the fatherson bond love between the son sky and his dying dad paternal love with candles maybe to symbolize death
hows sky alive did sun as q pray for him after he k worded himself drowning in the river from the shadow of skys q im 100 sure that it was sun maybe they both beggedprayed to save each other when they messed up other peoples lives and somehow redeemed their mistakescorrected their lives  both sunsky killed themselves out of pressure tho somehow theyre back to life because of their qssecond chance 
sunshineearthair convo was mature and sunshinesky reunion was the cutest  i really loved the pair somehow their visuals are refreshing and gives off that mature couple vibes very different from traditional bl couples
loved the seriesgoodbye 7 days before valentine


it was refreshing to watch something very different and im glad i came back to it after falling behind for a few weeks by the end i was very emotionally invested i even started crying as soon as that song played even before we knew sunshine was crying loved sunshines development and so happy to see where he ended up

and how cute that theyre sky and sunshine 2gether 4ever

i mean i get why the finale is the way it is narratively but still its kind of boring sure sure hes a changed man now find your guy and kiss already
the final scene is super cute though though it sure feels like they ran out of budget at the very end  but ill take it


i havent watched any episodes but im now just realizing the title is not fooling around


okay i watched it and i liked the ending there were some plot holes and some sloppy writing but overall i really enjoyed it


was there anything to the airport scene and the two little boys and how the camera focuses on the remaining boy after sunshine walks by or was it just filler for the voiceover


does anyone know the name of the song at the endthoughtsallday


woohoo why is everyone so hot 
also outstanding info on this onair i am sold  thank you 


when i realized drafts didnt save images i was sent reeling


i only post from my phone i have only logged on to reddit from a computer 1x ever so i just do text and save it in my notes and update for the following week so i can just copypaste 
your post though is incredible and i am obsessed 
i am so grateful for these onairs because i have heavy trust issues with the director from 180 so i need to read spoilers before  watching i cannot watch this blind so thank you i will be lurking the comments before watching each week


ill be there with you i am saving a few other dramas like this one absolute zero for the same reason


absolute zero is also on my tbd list 


i have heavy trust issues with the director from 180
i felt that in my bones


i love patricks novels but cant watch this i dont do suspense and this is too suspenseful for me gonna have to do what im doing with absolute zero and watch the last episode so i know what the resolution is before committing to a soulcrushing journey

totally understand and considering the director that seems like a good way to go lol


hi friend same i will be reading these onairs for spoilers every week though and will watch depending on the comments


broke down and watched the 1st episode its really good very patrick rangsimanty the main character sunshine has growing to do and his exboyfriend is a genuinely good person the complexity of the cupid reaper is intriguing well see if i have time to watch again before winter break


oh good keep me informed good sign that ep1 was good

i read the books so good i also have my imaginary boyfriend yet to read in my kindle i wonder if its one of the stores being made into shows
if you have kindle unlimited his books are free to read

it is its listed on mdl but no director or other info attached

i downloaded i love you kill you to read but i didnt see mystique in the mirror and sad universe


in my villain era
imaginary boyfriend is good i liked my ride better but of all the thai books patricks are for sure the better written ones

good to know thank you


aaarrrggghhh i want episode 2 right now i wanna throw a hissyfit like a threeyearold
anyway that was pretty cool love the art direction  all the different versions of the color red  from rose red to blood red to baby pink to amber to magentagawjus now im here wondering who my 7 would be just in case somjet ever comes by to make me a similar offer also please never let me get dumped under a sign that reads the end of the road the indignity

ptu seems to like very earthy tones like the color palate is very much reminding me of 180 degrees lol


i completely forgot that he was directing it and i kept thinking wow this is sooo theatrical while watching now my world makes sense again

types olive oil stained broken hip
i know who my 7 would be easy im not sure what i just watched made that was something very different


how how did you come up with 7 already ive come up with 2  and theyre both well known and they grind my last gears as for people i know i was like meh let em live  ive already deleted them from my life
im not sure what i just watched
it took me more than a minute tbh i rewatched it last night and it plays a lot better the second time around i found atoms acting a little overthetop and that threw me on the first goround still trying to wrap my head around the whole cupid reaper thing but its like theyre next leveling dear doctor im coming for soul it was only the second time around i realized the characters names were air sunshine and rain  how the heck did i miss that the first time  also  somjet im there for him 100 damn hes beautiful imo there are times i can be sooo shallow

types olive oil stained broken hip
you want the list


nah im good

types olive oil stained broken hip
yo made have you caught up with absolute zero


i love it love it love it its one of the most interesting pieces of writing ive come across since triage and 180 degreesand nobodys watching its like maybe a dozen or so of us talking about it but outside of thatcrickets
three more episodes to go and then my weekly dose of angst is done its one of my favorites for this year

types olive oil stained broken hip
i stopped at episode two just didnt have time for it thinking i make the ex watch it today


cause of death the heart killers 
this man is me i am this man
ok the music in this series is a choice im here for it

i gotta hand it to director ptu they do use a lot of interesting locations for shooting i actually love sunshines apartment especially the freight elevator
and a barflower shop shark tank here i come the break up was lowkey hilarious lol
enough what the fuck
i screamed 
overall solidinteresting first episode jet our cupid reaper and atom are  on 


in my villain era
well im sold its got a noir feel to it
off to read the novel 

if the series hits right im probably gonna read the novel too


ooo yay ive been excited for this one but also darn because i didnt realize this was a potential sad ending show i need to wait until its over now 

dont quote me because i have no insider knowledge but the vibe i get from the trailer is that sunshine and the angeldemonshinigami guy are endgame i hope so at least lol

wow what a first episode love the theater vibes as in 180 the music the colour pallet and the story telling havent disappointed
the only thing i will have to get used to is atoms acting here compared to the rest of the cast its over the top so i wonder if thats on purpose
also since now we sort of know who is who i went back to the latest trailer and so many things make more sense and it made me excited even more for the story cause i have no idea where its gonna go

i actually loved atoms big acting in this hes so mesmerizingengaging and it seems natural like hes just an excitable person if that makes sense as opposed to someone thats clearly doing too much lol

got ya i think thats why i did not say bad overactingmaybe its a bit strange to me because i dont know anyone excitable like that xd

types olive oil stained broken hip
it makes sense that final scene had me second guessing my dm to him on the acting but he playing drunk hurt and chaotic so well over the top and it did feel natural

had me second guessing my dm to him on the acting
i am screamingggggg

types olive oil stained broken hip
whatdont you dm all your fav actors on instagram too

never not once




im not at all sympathetic to his character or any of the others yet
and why does he get these 7 chances
not sure about this one for me only watching cos i loved 180 degrees


now that i know who is who im eager to see what happens next so far its checking all my boxes



i dont know what to think as everybody said sun is inmature and a child in an adults body however rain is not precisely an angel breaking up with his boyfriend after those cute messages in the cellphone is dirty and much more show up with your lover
the cupid reaper didnt play fair either taking advantage of suns drunken state is foul sun has killed a person even if the angel told him not to do it he didnt explain the consequences
i felt bad seeing air hugging his dad and probably disappearing forever
all this is going to bite him in the ass later and im here for it

from the synopsis is seems like sunshine has 7 chances over the course of 7 days so he will be deleting people willynilly to see what works lmao so a mess hell make i do wonder if on the 7th day sunshine will decide to delete himself and live happily ever after in the ever afterlife w our cutesexay cupid reaper


here is my theoryhope i think this is going to be similar to the butterfly effect where sun keeps trying to get with rain but things go awry the final awful thing will be that rain actually dies if sun makes himself the 7th person then everyone reappears including rain by that point sun has matured and makes the ultimate self sacrifice so rain is alive but then the reaper and sun will get to be together in the afterlife

types olive oil stained broken hip
lets go with this because i want to see them floating in the air making people disappear



reminds me of luminous solution  the vibe the unusual bar the need for 2nd chances goodluck atom  afterall it is a deal with the devil 

eek i never watched that but i heard it went to mess


secret crush on you
i could really see that the same production company and director as 180 degrees of longitude passes through us made this the feeling and cinematography gave me flashbacks to 180 degrees a great deal
i have to congratulate them on creating a couple that each is appalling in their own way rain is a dick for keeping a relationship going when it is plain he is already involved with air he didnt seem to feel that bad about breaking up with sunshine and was real quick to move on with air sunshine implied that rain likes young guys and i could kind of see it being true
sunshine on the other hand doesnt seem to care too much about why he is getting dumped only that he is and it feels more like a pride thing than a love thing
so far my favorite character is the horny cupid reaper i think this is the first ive ever seen or read of a cupid reaper that i laughed when kyu introduced himself i actually think it will be more fun for him to hook up with sunshine than rain
did anyone else notice the girl on the ground when sunshine was leaving all his costars adoring fans im wondering where that is going to come back into the story and more likely screw up sunshines wishes

did anyone else notice the girl on the ground when sunshine was leaving all his costars adoring fans im wondering where that is going to come back into the story and more likely screw up sunshines wishes
yeah i was wondering if this was gonna be a groundhogs day sort of story and we will keep rewinding and eventually sunshine is gonna catch the girl when she falls as a cute sort of gag to show how much hes changedgrown hmm


secret crush on you
i was wondering if somehow he is going to get blamed for what happens to her and has to use one of his wishes to make her disappear so he doesnt get in trouble


i forgot it premiered today 


oh god i didnt know it was starting already
we got atom in two dramas rn im sat
ill be back later with thoughts


this is good i wonder why they spend so much time on the rains cafe though are they showing us the next targets

rain is also a main character atom jet and thank are all main leads so he probably has a lot of story coming still


ooooooh i like this one so far
jared is the cutest little bean


i have absolutely no idea what the wings and horns are selling but ill buy 12

is this streaming for western audiences or no anyone know

i watched it streaming on wetvs site w english subs and everything not a single ad unless i tried to skip forward or back lol
eta im us california btw

excellent ill try im east coastdc 

im not completely invested in this show yet but very intrigued i will keep tuning in for future episodes i loved 180 degrees longitude and didnt know this was by the same director im expectinghoping for deep and meaningful character growth life lessons and dialogue im not gonna lie i had to check out this show just for shogun jet 

jet is so hot and cute at the same time 


super natural cupid reaper karma dharma mystery  erasing people  woah my type of bl i love how innovative thai bls are these days woah atom is killing his role i ship sunshine and cupid reaper i loved all the flower elements alcohol and genie like cupid reaper this is going to be iconic i just know it

i ship sunshine and cupid reaper
same director ptu better not fk w us


i think my brain just fell out looking at the pics of atom
hes hot im saying hes hot



loved the first episode sun is so damn hyper and hilarious also i love supernatural elements and deals made with otherworldly forces i even liked luminous solution atom nataphop sun has instantly won me over hope he gets a lot more roles

i love him too hes also in bake me please where hes such a ray of sunshine which is so interesting considering his name in 7days lol 


ooh i need to check out bake me please then yes he makes me feel happy just looking at him love his energy so far


ugh i wanna watch this but i dont have a wetv subscription 

i dont know exactly when the vip sub kicks in but 4ps in and ive been watching it for free so far lol


lol yay imma head over to watch it now ok this is my dark horse of 2023 i was not expecting this 3 episodes in and im in love this is far more evolved from the novella and im here for it the colouring the sets and the camera work its all very intentional
the selfaware acknowledgment of this being a faustian tale and honestly its done so effectively you can tell the director has a background in stage it feels like a stage play in the blocking the suffocating feeling of the apartment and even the dialogue but the novella is mostly dialogue it lends itself well to the medium
flowers to atom as well his character in bake me please is very one dimensional and the first two episodes here were a little rocky but this episode showed some acting chops i was solidly impressed
i am absolutely doing a source vs series post on this one

types olive oil stained broken hip
its also wacky dark romantic and different im glad atom is getting a chance to shine

are we gonna get a bathtub scene everytime sunshine makes a wish because i approve
this episode is virtually all narration i applaud them for making it still dynamic if this was in any other random bl this much narration would probably be much drier


jared is so creepily adorable
this is getting interesting i thought we were gonna have seven people disappear but its more fun this way


i guess the three of us watching are really enjoying it
i like that i have no idea what will happen the plot is plotting and the boys are hot

i am screaming lol 

thinking about my blessing and dear doctor im coming for your soul in thailand are all undead so gorgeous

im here too i watched bmp and i really like atom his look is so fierce in both of these shows but here im really impressed its a very meta story but done well took me a minute to start but ill be here until the end



the more things change the more they stay the same


im assuming sunshine and the cupid reaper are gonna get together some how i wonder when


im here too had too many life stuff today to watch but plan on doing it tomorrowyall are keeping me hyped


so if i understood well every time sunshine makes a new wish his last wish gets cancelled that means that air is fine and well with his father
for the way i see it rains partners until now have been awesome people like air who took care of his father and now mek who fights against injustice and discrimination
i think the problem here is rain who seems to have been using sunshine all this time and of course sunshine for not accepting that its all over between them
sunshines refusal to speak about his parents probably is a great hint of where his abandonement issues come from and why he cant let rain go

types olive oil stained broken hip
interesting im in the middle of episode three and glad to see that plot twist air was so green flag


rwrb ofc bmftms
to tell the truth although sunshine is immature until now i dislike rain more he used an inexperienced boy younger than him as a rebound while he treasured the memories of his ex and when he felt that they were not compatible he entered into a new relationship with the son of a client without ending their existing relationship the guy dumped sun a week before valentines day and immediately posted a photo of their affair after the breakup 
sunshine is definitely deleting the wrong people


yass my ship sunshine  q is sailing i sense tension between themi loved the flashback scenes imagination diarynow im curious about q and also the next weeks preview did rain forget about sunshine oh wow dude messed up  when he erased someone i guess im loving this series the story is unique and unpredictable 
and special appreciation to atom wow i hope he gets to play crazy characters in his upcoming works he fits oddball characters so much  love him 

types olive oil stained broken hip
i despise grandpa boxers atom this episode made me appreciate them 41 years of loathing those things and he had me at mek

types olive oil stained broken hip
well sun really is going to make a bigger mess out of his life week after week he really doesnt understand that our lovers and friends change us even to a small degree
his choice this week is going to change rain in ways that may screw his goal up to the nth degree
also how lovely was this dialogue driven plot somjet and boxerboy atom carried the entire episode on their backs fantasticthis easily comes in my top 2 current on air shows this ep was so cool with fights and total reset in their storysunshine  q is not possible as of now like i can feel that theyre curious about each other and have empathy to the point they know that both of them have that sadness in their eyes but still the romance plot is out of the question now i want sunshine to move on from rain but thats the actual plot i hope to see sunshineq and more about qs past human identity in the upcoming episodes so far i like this unique concept the idea is really genius for a plot


i am on the fence with a q and sunshine pairing while i dont want sunshine with rain as i dont think that would end happily in any universe i am not sure about sunshine and q either i think that q must have gone through something similar and failed and perhaps that is howwhy he is a cupid reaper just theorising as i have not read the books or many spoilers
i am also guessing that successful or not after the 7 wishes q will move on and i think that may be more painful if they were truly in love but given the if you love it let it go undercurrent of this series perhaps that will be the ultimate test of whether sunshine has truly changed now i made myself sad and need to go back to a cupcake series to cheer up


i agree with you like sunshine q is impossible just a shippers wish but id also not want rainsunshine too now that its a reset  like rain  and his coworker barista makes a good pair  i also have a hunch like u like q either died by suicide falling off from a tall building or q made impulsive decisions just like sunshine when he had a cupid reaper that makes him sympathize with the lead to an extent

now i want sunshine to move on from rain
spill the fucking tea like hello lol

total ho for supanuts smile
i appreciate that we get a barely dressed sunshine or q every episode even if i wasnt thoroughly enjoying the plot and characters that would for sure keep me coming back
also jet is gorgeous and my lovefavorite of the day


the episode opened with sunshine in nothing but his boxers for the first 10 minutes they are giving us what we want

jokes on you im into that
q coming in with the heat this week sunshine is going to need some burn ointment for his ego
i would totally let q talk to me like that with a face like his


in my villain era
im trying to keep my expectations in check because ive been hurt before but this has shot to the top of my list atom is nailing it the series is a conceptual one leaning heavily on our leads especially atom but they are carrying it off well
like i said not going to get my hopes to high but i hope more people watch it should get more love
side note shout out to sunshines board most realistic red string board ive ever seen

this series is deeeeep and hello to all my anxieties about people not wanting to be with me coming to the surface
this is wrestling with really hard questions bc as q says life is hard
wowowow


hows the series i have the novel but have yet to begin reading it

its really good tbh im digging it so far even tho after the jackjoker teaser dropped i lost interest in all other shows lmao


just watched the first episode not sure i like it tho but ill continue with the second episode lol


if possible  if u read the whole thing  can u spoil the story please


my reading list is quite lengthy so i doubt it will happen any time soon lol but once ive read it ill inbox you though it may be too late


i binged the first three episodes earlier this week and was so looking forward to this episode and i wasnt disappointed
i love the dynamic between q and sunshine they are both so damaged and we are not yet sure why
i share qs frustration with sunshine over taking the easy way out sunshine just wants what he had and really isnt willing to fight for his and rains love i am beginning to question whether it was love in the first place seeing how they got together more like companionship and rebounding
sunshine will continue to frustrate me and i am a bit terrified of the ending especially knowing the director and his past work that said now i have to wait until next weekugh

ive decided to watch the series when all the episodes are out its impossible to wait one week for each ep tt

that poetry session came out of nowhere and the fight was forthcoming its nice though the first meeting story was honestly dragging on a little bit so that was a nice change of pace


this was a good episode to understand the characters better although there wasnt much action sunshine really is a shallow thinker but then i wouldnt want to face with this type of challenge i wonder if q is someone from sunshines past or past lifehow did i not realize that sunshine was also the guy in bake me please
such a cutie

jokes on you im into that
whelp i just learnt that the novel is available on kindle unlimited and now i know what im going to be doing for the next couple of days

well this is definitely interesting not sure what else he could learn now i feel like eventually hell have to admit that he himself is the problem and then what


aaah what is with love rebirthhorrific dark pastaka death and that fortune teller asks q to fall in love my ship is sailing aaaaaahh love it beginning of the ep they were sharing their miseries and wow there is tension qsunshine probable end game rain and sun are not compatible at all sunshine let go of him boyrain tolerates u thats it
i kinda relate to sunshine as a person who does not care that much about politics and the aftermath sheesh what in the north korea was that


i really liked this episode with the fortune teller and learning more about sunshines parents they are now on the list for worst parents especially the mom
the backstory with the politician and commentary on equality in general and marriage equality specifically was great sunshines behaviour and expressions during that whole scene just highlight how narcissistic he is i understand not being into politics but this was important to rain and he didnt take the time to understand why again i come bak to the conclusion that he doesnt really love rain
as an aside i read the book today it is a short and easy read i wont spoil it but i can say there is a lot more depth to the characters in the series although sunshine is a bit more aware in the book than we see in the show


checking in is there any actual bl in this series or is it like 180 without an actual romance

lmao yes there is we even got some sunshinerain kissies last episode but you can tell the director has a theatre background because much like w 180 degrees theres a lot of 2 characters talking in empty space sort of scenes and monologues im still 80 sure sunshine and q are endgame



much like w 180 degrees theres a lot of 2 characters talking in empty space sort of scenes and monologues
i put up with a lot of this and honestly didnt mind it at first in 180 because they gave me abs and clavicles and nakedness but if no one is making out pre or post these monologues and empty spaces it gets to be bangxiety and i cant do that

theres actually a lot of nakedness in this there was an entire scene w our cute reaper wet and out of the tub talking with sunshine and i think its in atoms contract to be shirtlessin his underwear every episode


oh good yay thats a good sign thank you hopefully someone will make use of his nakedness soon 

hes not naked at all in bake me pls so i am happy to see it here lol 


there is a bl plot and subplots too i cant say they show much about the lead couples story  but it shows more about rain and his exs and how the lead erases people to bond with rain again


thank you so no making out so far



there are scenes with kisses but still i have no clue whether there is going to be a love triangle or who are the lead couple




in my villain era
lol its not a romance thoughts the author even says that in the preface of the novella its more about understading that our choices have far reaching consequences and trying to put our own selfish wants above those we thought we loved only hurts ourselves and others in the end




in my villain era
apparently the story continues in 7 days before halloween but i cant find that one


why cant this dude be preachy all he wants but also give us boys loving each other and making out  why does he hate happy things


in my villain era
im happy atom is getting something other then bake me to his acting credit


very true


sunshine is kind of a brat how long before he realises hes the problem cupid and rain deserve better lmao also if rain didnt rememberknow who sunshine was in the previous episode how come the landlady was asking about him am i on crackto me this is starting to drag theres no real growth in sunshines character or how he interacts with q so it feels like theyre just running in circle though i guess he himself also feels like hes running in circle


i feel the same the premise is so interesting and then it gets old so fast i need to see some regret or remorse or realization or something from sunshine he just seems like a soulless ass that no good person should ever be stuck with

absolutely the only thing he regrets is trusting q over and over again lmao his character has no growth he still only blames q for the decisions he made himself


the only logical way for him to fix the mess he is in now is to make the last person to vanish q if q didnt exist none of the things happen and sunshine can try to redeem himself and that just feels pointless i dont get the direction this is supposed to go in unless hes suppose to fall for q  maybe wish for the person that made him a cupid reaper to disappear that feels like a stretch maybe just realize hes an ass and move on and find someone else


youre right i thought that with time sunshine would realize the wrong in his ways but no every time he wishes something he screws it even more
considering that rain and him got to know each other thanks to rain going to meens club theyre probably strangers in this timeline or much worse without meen maybe rain killed himself
i thought sunshine and q would have sexy moments or at least some attraction but no sunshine is obsessed with rain and q is just sneaky

i had the exact same thoughts while watching the episode 

jokes on you im into that
poor q stuck with sunshine that seems to be immune to learning absolutely any life lessons from any of these erases its okay q we all understand your frustrations
not from this episode

i loved that scene and i hate how sunshine didnt learn anything from it ugh they just went back to the plan as usual its starting to get on my nerves tbh


i really do love this show so much atom is killing it that being said sunshine really needs to learn the lesson staring him in the face erasing the best friend was so stupid and qs reaction was spot on i understand that sunshine has no friends and therefore doesnt understand the implications and that he only thinks about himself but at somepoint he has to think about hot it will impact rain as that is supposed to be his ultimate goal
next week seems to be a realisation about what he has been doing but i am not convinced that sunshine will take any responsibility poor q stuck there with him till the end i would have gone to my employer and asked for a new assingmentcomment image


from the trailer i have a hunch that q disappears atlast i hope that doesnt happen didnt read the novel yet  so far i think its bromance between qsunshine  lets see how this goes 3 more nights until valentine

ugh at this point i only care about q and his backstory sunshine is annoying af  hes not understanding it at all it so frustratingly slow too


jackjokerustealmyheart
for me this show is what you get when the movie ground hogs day plays fuck around and find out with be careful what you wish for i agree with other comments complimenting atoms performance the boy deserves better storylines when i watched ep 4 i thought it was turning into a classic morality play but insight evaded atom once again so here we are hoping for something meaningful or at least sexy between the cupid reaper and atom appears pointless at this stage so my question is just where is the boys loveim very much enjoying this series i can see how this isnt for eveyrone its for sure an expermential series in terms of not only what theyre doing with the plot but also filming and the sequencing i wasnt a fan of atoms crying in this epsode think his acting was a little too over the top on cartoon if hed pulled it in a little more would be better to be fair hes a new face and this is a big ask theres a lot of nuance to this series and theyve layred in the sociatal critiques as well hes doing a far job of it
i highly recommend if you are looking for somthing more exestential very much applud the whole production


i guess there are three of us enjoying the series its different but im here for that i like that its a smaller set with a characterdriven plot


in my villain era
right i made the mistake of reading the comment section for it on mdl and just about lost my shit i should know better mdl comment section is toxic as hell

whenever someone comments that like 5 people are keeping up w this show it sends me into orbit


good orbit or bad orbit i wish there were more of us


upvote count is up to 15 go to twitter if you have it  post screenshots i havent since winter break ive been floating in nonscheduled bliss but will get back to it

theatrical angst i enjoyed it but i would enjoy it a lot more if they were kissing while crying 
the shade at series y though  atom was just out of one


making some movement although we still dont have answers about who is q sunshine is learning about the interconnectivity but looking at the preview he hasnt become any more wise his family background really breaks my heart btw he was traumatized by his parents abandonment and doesnt have anyone in his life so hes desperately hanging onto rain


i am really enjoying this series the grief coming from sunshine while of his own making was palpable and has started him down a redemption path i continue to be intrigued by who q is and his change from light to dark while they have made some changes from the book if they follow anything i think that the next wish will be the one that really breaks things open that and we are at episode 8 so the plot needs to plot from here on out i cannot wait to see how this ends and whether any of them get an he at this point i dont necessarily want any of them together i just want them alive and somewhat changed by the end
i think that atom is really doing and excellent job here and was really impressed with his work in this episode


im not sure i want them together either but i do hope for some sort of resolution and growth for their characters
i really am enjoying the series its unlike anything else out there


it really is quite different and i hope that the seeming lack of interestunderstanding doesnt deter other creators from tackling unconventional stories in the future we need our light fluff but also stories like these that challenge and maybe even upset us i want all the colours of art in this genre



this ep contributed nothing to the story but it was all about emotions that maxima actress is so talented  hope she gets more gigs like this it was all about cryingangsti honestly dont blame sunshine that much this power of erasing people to make the relationship work is evil in many ways and he has no one so technically the only solution is erasing rains people otherwise the story ends in ep 2 itself he finally feels guilty so there is character development and q is helpless too the story is complicated now aa the eps go by
the crying scenes were funny in a way but not that bad too ive seen worse atom is truly talented i cant help but think theyre laughing when they show teeth whenever theyre cryingi know it is to show their pain but its common in filmsseries i guess

jokes on you im into that
im so glad that sunshine did a reading of macbeth because it fits his character perfectly for this episode i was wondering what they were doing a reading of and hoped it was this before maxima even started speaking as soon as she started to speak i was internally clapping for this brilliant decision by the writerproduction team


this is the show that i look forward to the most every week the emotional meltdown was really well done and that cold read had me on the edge of my seat hope more folks start watching


this whole show is a train wreck to me the over the top acting from atom is getting on my nerves the reaper dude is carrying this whole show i dont like the boyfriend either he really has no good qualities as a character i dont know what atoms character likes about him i am forcing myself to finish this because the premise was in my wheelhouse i am hoping it gets better somehow

i got lost in the holiday shuffle with all my kids and christmas caught up last week and am about to sit down for this episode nowthis ep was a bit of a mess
i had no idea what the conversation was about in the flower shop


i thought it was just me phew i know theyre just not spilling all the beans yet and theyre supposed to be mysterious but those two were speaking in code and i felt stupid lol


im pretty sure sunshine will wish to erase himself in his last wish
the last two wishes killed rain and now he forgot him im interested of how this ends but at the same time i felt tricked
i hoped that through wishes sunshine would realize that rain is not for him and he will try to be with cupid but its not going to be like that in fact i feel that this is not really a bl


i understand the feeling tricked part and at first i wanted sunshine and q to have a relationship but as we get more into this i dont want that anymore
the short story that this is based on states that this is not a bl it really is a story of consequences and letting go told through a queer lens


to really fix everything he would need to erase q because that would make it where q never came and offered wishes in the first place he would then need to realize he sucks as a bf and either grow up and try to win rain back or just move on and try to be better to the next person maybe q is erased as a cupid reaper so he can be reincarnated as a person and they get together


this keeps getting darker and darker
im wondering if sunshine somehow ends up becoming a cupid reaper and has to grant someone elses wishes thats what it looked like was happening at the end of the preview
i have no idea how the series will end


i really love this show so much nuance and subtlety sunshine finally is starting to understand that no wish will bring rain back now what does he do erase himself learn to live with it or erase q really looking forward to seeing how this works out
as q gets darker we see more of his conflict and emotions in having to fulfill these wishes it makes me wonder if this his is first time as a cupid reaper or is sunshine diferent because he reminds q of qtheory flower boy is the head guy and all those flowers he is naming are real people that all erased themselvesgot erased


in my villain era
atom nailed it this episode he was loosing me last two i felt he was a little over the top but this episode he nailed it i am surprised by how quick the series is moving this is what happens in the novella but i didnt think itd be so early maybe well get some romance
that song in the episode was fire going to see if i can find it


that song in the episode was fire
theyve released two ost mvs so far
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvagclteckm9q
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvd2cdrrud0rg

is it just me or the sexual tension is amping up even though im pretty sure that is going nowhere
3 more episodes what now the preview is entering an epilogue territory but 3 episodes are way too long for that

is it just me or the sexual tension is amping up even though im pretty sure that is going nowhere
lmao youve basically just summed up 180 degree longitude passes through us so


lmao youve basically just summed up 180 degree longitude passes through us so
that is so horribly correct dammit


i saw that coming but i thought it would be the dreaded 11th episode when it happened not the 9th now where does the story go im hooked like a tuna
and yes the sexual tension has been dialed up to 11 but theres nowhere for it to go


that song that keeps getting played by the busker in the park is a banger dont suppose anyone knows the titleartist


global examination icdi pbai and vegas
i assumed they just did it for the series i have no idea but i love it and need it in my playlist pls update if you find it 

when flower shop guy said q came from the past to the future specifically to help sun i thought they were going to pull some shit like hes his dad from the past or something and was preparing myself to be grossed out by the almostkiss but safe for another week i guess
i normally hate this kind of indie show but i really want to know what happens in the end 


global examination icdi pbai and vegas
okay so theory please tell me if this was obvious and everyone already thought of this but i just finished binging all 9 eps q was suns last lover and q ereased himself so he chose him so they could get back together
btw i love this series sooo much like  its a 810 from me

this is actually an interesting theory because iirc sunshine said rain was his first bf which honestly doesnt track w how hot and outgoing sunshine is  but if his exbf was erased of course sunshine wouldnt remember him
