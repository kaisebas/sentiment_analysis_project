thoughtsallday


woohoo why is everyone so hot 
also outstanding info on this onair i am sold  thank you 


when i realized drafts didnt save images i was sent reeling


i only post from my phone i have only logged on to reddit from a computer 1x ever so i just do text and save it in my notes and update for the following week so i can just copypaste 
your post though is incredible and i am obsessed 
i am so grateful for these onairs because i have heavy trust issues with the director from 180 so i need to read spoilers before  watching i cannot watch this blind so thank you i will be lurking the comments before watching each week


ill be there with you i am saving a few other dramas like this one absolute zero for the same reason


absolute zero is also on my tbd list 


i have heavy trust issues with the director from 180
i felt that in my bones


i love patricks novels but cant watch this i dont do suspense and this is too suspenseful for me gonna have to do what im doing with absolute zero and watch the last episode so i know what the resolution is before committing to a soulcrushing journey

totally understand and considering the director that seems like a good way to go lol


hi friend same i will be reading these onairs for spoilers every week though and will watch depending on the comments


broke down and watched the 1st episode its really good very patrick rangsimanty the main character sunshine has growing to do and his exboyfriend is a genuinely good person the complexity of the cupid reaper is intriguing well see if i have time to watch again before winter break


oh good keep me informed good sign that ep1 was good

i read the books so good i also have my imaginary boyfriend yet to read in my kindle i wonder if its one of the stores being made into shows
if you have kindle unlimited his books are free to read

it is its listed on mdl but no director or other info attached

i downloaded i love you kill you to read but i didnt see mystique in the mirror and sad universe


in my villain era
imaginary boyfriend is good i liked my ride better but of all the thai books patricks are for sure the better written ones


yes i own a physical copy of my ride and was frustrated that they changed tawans friend from male to female

i loved my imaginary boyfriend


good to know thank you


aaarrrggghhh i want episode 2 right now i wanna throw a hissyfit like a threeyearold
anyway that was pretty cool love the art direction  all the different versions of the color red  from rose red to blood red to baby pink to amber to magentagawjus now im here wondering who my 7 would be just in case somjet ever comes by to make me a similar offer also please never let me get dumped under a sign that reads the end of the road the indignity

ptu seems to like very earthy tones like the color palate is very much reminding me of 180 degrees lol


i completely forgot that he was directing it and i kept thinking wow this is sooo theatrical while watching now my world makes sense again

types olive oil stained broken hip
i know who my 7 would be easy im not sure what i just watched made that was something very different


how how did you come up with 7 already ive come up with 2  and theyre both well known and they grind my last gears as for people i know i was like meh let em live  ive already deleted them from my life
im not sure what i just watched
it took me more than a minute tbh i rewatched it last night and it plays a lot better the second time around i found atoms acting a little overthetop and that threw me on the first goround still trying to wrap my head around the whole cupid reaper thing but its like theyre next leveling dear doctor im coming for soul it was only the second time around i realized the characters names were air sunshine and rain  how the heck did i miss that the first time  also  somjet im there for him 100 damn hes beautiful imo there are times i can be sooo shallow

types olive oil stained broken hip
you want the list


nah im good

types olive oil stained broken hip
yo made have you caught up with absolute zero


i love it love it love it its one of the most interesting pieces of writing ive come across since triage and 180 degreesand nobodys watching its like maybe a dozen or so of us talking about it but outside of thatcrickets
three more episodes to go and then my weekly dose of angst is done its one of my favorites for this year

types olive oil stained broken hip
i stopped at episode two just didnt have time for it thinking i make the ex watch it today


cause of death the heart killers 
this man is me i am this man
ok the music in this series is a choice im here for it

i gotta hand it to director ptu they do use a lot of interesting locations for shooting i actually love sunshines apartment especially the freight elevator
and a barflower shop shark tank here i come the break up was lowkey hilarious lol
enough what the fuck
i screamed 
overall solidinteresting first episode jet our cupid reaper and atom are  on 


in my villain era
well im sold its got a noir feel to it
off to read the novel 

if the series hits right im probably gonna read the novel too


ooo yay ive been excited for this one but also darn because i didnt realize this was a potential sad ending show i need to wait until its over now 

dont quote me because i have no insider knowledge but the vibe i get from the trailer is that sunshine and the angeldemonshinigami guy are endgame i hope so at least lol

wow what a first episode love the theater vibes as in 180 the music the colour pallet and the story telling havent disappointed
the only thing i will have to get used to is atoms acting here compared to the rest of the cast its over the top so i wonder if thats on purpose
also since now we sort of know who is who i went back to the latest trailer and so many things make more sense and it made me excited even more for the story cause i have no idea where its gonna go

i actually loved atoms big acting in this hes so mesmerizingengaging and it seems natural like hes just an excitable person if that makes sense as opposed to someone thats clearly doing too much lol

got ya i think thats why i did not say bad overactingmaybe its a bit strange to me because i dont know anyone excitable like that xd

types olive oil stained broken hip
it makes sense that final scene had me second guessing my dm to him on the acting but he playing drunk hurt and chaotic so well over the top and it did feel natural

had me second guessing my dm to him on the acting
i am screamingggggg

types olive oil stained broken hip
whatdont you dm all your fav actors on instagram too

never not once




im not at all sympathetic to his character or any of the others yet
and why does he get these 7 chances
not sure about this one for me only watching cos i loved 180 degrees


now that i know who is who im eager to see what happens next so far its checking all my boxes



i dont know what to think as everybody said sun is inmature and a child in an adults body however rain is not precisely an angel breaking up with his boyfriend after those cute messages in the cellphone is dirty and much more show up with your lover
the cupid reaper didnt play fair either taking advantage of suns drunken state is foul sun has killed a person even if the angel told him not to do it he didnt explain the consequences
i felt bad seeing air hugging his dad and probably disappearing forever
all this is going to bite him in the ass later and im here for it

from the synopsis is seems like sunshine has 7 chances over the course of 7 days so he will be deleting people willynilly to see what works lmao so a mess hell make i do wonder if on the 7th day sunshine will decide to delete himself and live happily ever after in the ever afterlife w our cutesexay cupid reaper


here is my theoryhope i think this is going to be similar to the butterfly effect where sun keeps trying to get with rain but things go awry the final awful thing will be that rain actually dies if sun makes himself the 7th person then everyone reappears including rain by that point sun has matured and makes the ultimate self sacrifice so rain is alive but then the reaper and sun will get to be together in the afterlife

types olive oil stained broken hip
lets go with this because i want to see them floating in the air making people disappear



reminds me of luminous solution  the vibe the unusual bar the need for 2nd chances goodluck atom  afterall it is a deal with the devil 

eek i never watched that but i heard it went to mess


secret crush on you
i could really see that the same production company and director as 180 degrees of longitude passes through us made this the feeling and cinematography gave me flashbacks to 180 degrees a great deal
i have to congratulate them on creating a couple that each is appalling in their own way rain is a dick for keeping a relationship going when it is plain he is already involved with air he didnt seem to feel that bad about breaking up with sunshine and was real quick to move on with air sunshine implied that rain likes young guys and i could kind of see it being true
sunshine on the other hand doesnt seem to care too much about why he is getting dumped only that he is and it feels more like a pride thing than a love thing
so far my favorite character is the horny cupid reaper i think this is the first ive ever seen or read of a cupid reaper that i laughed when kyu introduced himself i actually think it will be more fun for him to hook up with sunshine than rain
did anyone else notice the girl on the ground when sunshine was leaving all his costars adoring fans im wondering where that is going to come back into the story and more likely screw up sunshines wishes

did anyone else notice the girl on the ground when sunshine was leaving all his costars adoring fans im wondering where that is going to come back into the story and more likely screw up sunshines wishes
yeah i was wondering if this was gonna be a groundhogs day sort of story and we will keep rewinding and eventually sunshine is gonna catch the girl when she falls as a cute sort of gag to show how much hes changedgrown hmm


secret crush on you
i was wondering if somehow he is going to get blamed for what happens to her and has to use one of his wishes to make her disappear so he doesnt get in trouble


i forgot it premiered today 


oh god i didnt know it was starting already
we got atom in two dramas rn im sat
ill be back later with thoughts


this is good i wonder why they spend so much time on the rains cafe though are they showing us the next targets

rain is also a main character atom jet and thank are all main leads so he probably has a lot of story coming still
