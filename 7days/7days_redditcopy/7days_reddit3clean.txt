ok this is my dark horse of 2023 i was not expecting this 3 episodes in and im in love this is far more evolved from the novella and im here for it the colouring the sets and the camera work its all very intentional
the selfaware acknowledgment of this being a faustian tale and honestly its done so effectively you can tell the director has a background in stage it feels like a stage play in the blocking the suffocating feeling of the apartment and even the dialogue but the novella is mostly dialogue it lends itself well to the medium
flowers to atom as well his character in bake me please is very one dimensional and the first two episodes here were a little rocky but this episode showed some acting chops i was solidly impressed
i am absolutely doing a source vs series post on this one

its also wacky dark romantic and different im glad atom is getting a chance to shine

are we gonna get a bathtub scene everytime sunshine makes a wish because i approve
this episode is virtually all narration i applaud them for making it still dynamic if this was in any other random bl this much narration would probably be much drier


jared is so creepily adorable
this is getting interesting i thought we were gonna have seven people disappear but its more fun this way


i guess the three of us watching are really enjoying it
i like that i have no idea what will happen the plot is plotting and the boys are hot

i am screaming lol 

thinking about my blessing and dear doctor im coming for your soul in thailand are all undead so gorgeous

im here too i watched bmp and i really like atom his look is so fierce in both of these shows but here im really impressed its a very meta story but done well took me a minute to start but ill be here until the end



the more things change the more they stay the same


im assuming sunshine and the cupid reaper are gonna get together some how i wonder when


im here too had too many life stuff today to watch but plan on doing it tomorrowyall are keeping me hyped


so if i understood well every time sunshine makes a new wish his last wish gets cancelled that means that air is fine and well with his father
for the way i see it rains partners until now have been awesome people like air who took care of his father and now mek who fights against injustice and discrimination
i think the problem here is rain who seems to have been using sunshine all this time and of course sunshine for not accepting that its all over between them
sunshines refusal to speak about his parents probably is a great hint of where his abandonement issues come from and why he cant let rain go

interesting im in the middle of episode three and glad to see that plot twist air was so green flag


rwrb ofc bmftms
to tell the truth although sunshine is immature until now i dislike rain more he used an inexperienced boy younger than him as a rebound while he treasured the memories of his ex and when he felt that they were not compatible he entered into a new relationship with the son of a client without ending their existing relationship the guy dumped sun a week before valentines day and immediately posted a photo of their affair after the breakup 
sunshine is definitely deleting the wrong people


yass my ship sunshine  q is sailing i sense tension between themi loved the flashback scenes imagination diarynow im curious about q and also the next weeks preview did rain forget about sunshine oh wow dude messed up  when he erased someone i guess im loving this series the story is unique and unpredictable 
and special appreciation to atom wow i hope he gets to play crazy characters in his upcoming works he fits oddball characters so much  love him

i despise grandpa boxers atom this episode made me appreciate them 41 years of loathing those things and he had me at mek

well sun really is going to make a bigger mess out of his life week after week he really doesnt understand that our lovers and friends change us even to a small degree
his choice this week is going to change rain in ways that may screw his goal up to the nth degree
also how lovely was this dialogue driven plot somjet and boxerboy atom carried the entire episode on their backs fantastic
