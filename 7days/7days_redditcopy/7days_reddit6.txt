To me, this is starting to drag. There's no real growth in Sunshine's character or how he interacts with Q, so it feels like they're just running in circle. Though I guess he himself also feels like he's running in circle.

I feel the same, the premise is so interesting and then it gets old so fast. I need to see some regret or remorse or realization or SOMETHING from Sunshine. He just seems like a soulless ass that no good person should ever be stuck with.

Absolutely. The only thing he regrets is trusting Q over and over again, lmao. His character has no growth, he still only blames Q for the decisions he made himself.

The only logical way for him to fix the mess he is in now is to make the last person to vanish Q. If Q didn't exist none of the things happen and Sunshine can try to redeem himself and that just feels... pointless? I don't get the direction this is supposed to go in unless he's suppose to fall for Q ? Maybe wish for the person that made him a cupid reaper to disappear? That feels like a stretch... Maybe just realize he's an ass and move on and find someone else?

You're right. I thought that with time Sunshine would realize the wrong in his ways, but no. Every time he wishes something he screws it even more.

Considering that Rain and him got to know each other thanks to Rain going to Meen's club they're probably strangers in this timeline or much worse, without Meen maybe Rain killed himself.

I thought Sunshine and Q would have sexy moments or at least some attraction but no, Sunshine is obsessed with Rain and Q is just sneaky.

Jokes on you, I'm into that.
Poor Q stuck with Sunshine that seems to be immune to learning absolutely ANY life lessons from any of these erases. It's okay, Q. We all understand your frustrations.


(Not from this episode.)

I really do love this show so much. Atom is killing it. That being said Sunshine really needs to learn the lesson staring him in the face. Erasing the best friend was so stupid and Q's reaction was spot on. I understand that Sunshine has no friends and therefore doesn't understand the implications and that he only thinks about himself, but at somepoint he has to think about hot it will impact Rain as that is supposed to be his ultimate goal!

Next week seems to be a realisation about what he has been doing but I am not convinced that Sunshine will take any responsibility. Poor Q stuck there with him till the end! I would have gone to my employer and asked for a new assingmentComment Image

For me this show is what you get when the movie Ground Hog's Day plays fuck around and find out with "be careful what you wish for." I agree with other comments complimenting Atom's performance; the boy deserves better storylines. When I watched Ep 4 I thought it was turning into a classic morality play, but insight evaded Atom once again, so here we are. Hoping for something meaningful (or at least sexy) between the Cupid Reaper and Atom appears pointless at this stage, so my question is, just where is the boy's love??
