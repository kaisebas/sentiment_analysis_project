I only post from my phone (I have only logged on to reddit from a computer 1x ever🤦🏻‍♀️) so I just do text and save it in my notes and update for the following week so I can just copy/paste 🙈

Your post, though, is INCREDIBLE, and I am obsessed 😍

I am SO grateful for these on-airs because I have heavy trust issues with the Director from 180 so I NEED to read spoilers before 👀 watching. I cannot watch this blind. So THANK YOU!! I will be lurking the comments before watching each week.

I LOVE Patrick's novels but can't watch this. I don't do suspense and this is too suspenseful for me. Gonna have to do what I'm doing with Absolute Zero and watch the last episode so I know what the resolution is before committing to a soul-crushing journey.

Broke down and watched the 1st episode. It's really good. Very Patrick Rangsimant-y. The main character Sunshine has growing to do, and his ex-boyfriend is a genuinely good person. The complexity of the Cupid Reaper is intriguing. We'll see if I have time to watch again before winter break.

AAARRRGGGHHH! I want episode 2 right now! I wanna throw a hissy-fit like a three-year-old!

Anyway, that was pretty cool. Love the Art Direction - all the different versions of the color red - from rose red to blood red to baby pink to amber to magenta...gaw-jus! Now I'm here wondering who my 7 would be (just in case Somjet ever comes by to make me a similar offer). Also please never let me get dumped under a sign that reads "The End of the Road". The indignity!

How?!? How did you come up with 7 already? I've come up with 2 - and they're both well known and they grind my last gears. As for people I know, I was like, "Meh! Let 'em live - I've already deleted them from my life!"

I'm not sure what I just watched

It took me more than a minute, TBH. I rewatched it last night and it plays a lot better the second time around. I found Atom's acting a little over-the-top and that threw me on the first go-round. Still trying to wrap my head around the whole "Cupid Reaper" thing, but it's like they're next leveling Dear Doctor, I'm Coming for Soul. It was only the second time around I realized the characters' names were Air, Sunshine, and Rain - how the heck did I miss that the first time? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Also - Somjet. I'm there for him 100%. Damn, he's beautiful, IMO. There are times I can be sooo shallow...

I love it! Love it! Love it! It's one of the most interesting pieces of writing I've come across since Triage and 180 Degrees...and nobody's watching. It's like maybe a dozen or so of us talking about it, but outside of that...crickets.

Three more episodes to go, and then my weekly dose of angst is done. It's one of my favorites for this year.

i gotta hand it to director P'Tu, they do use a lot of interesting locations for shooting. I actually love Sunshine's apartment especially the freight elevator.

and a bar/flower shop... shark tank, here I come! The break up was lowkey hilarious. lol

"Enough? What the fuck?!"

i SCREAMED. 🙊😩

overall, solid/interesting first episode. Jet our Cupid Reaper and Atom are 🔥 on 🔥

Wow, what a first episode! Love the theater vibes as in 180, the music, the colour pallet, and the story telling haven't disappointed!

The only thing I will have to get used to is Atom's acting here, compared to the rest of the cast it's over the top, so I wonder if that's on purpose.

Also, since now we sort of know who is who I went back to the latest trailer and so many things make more sense and it made me excited even more for the story cause I have no idea where it's gonna go.

I'm not at all sympathetic to his character (or any of the others) yet.
And why does he get these 7 chances?

Not sure about this one for me. Only watching cos I loved 180 degrees

I don't know what to think. As everybody said Sun is inmature and a child in an adult's body however Rain is not precisely an angel. Breaking up with his boyfriend after those cute messages in the cellphone is dirty and much more show up with your lover.

The cupid reaper didn't play fair either, taking advantage of Sun's drunken state is foul. Sun "has killed" a person even if the angel told him not to do it, he didn't explain the consequences.
I felt bad seeing Air hugging his dad and probably disappearing forever.

All this is going to bite him in the ass later and I'm here for it.

from the synopsis is seems like Sunshine has 7 chances over the course of 7 days? So he will be deleting people willy-nilly to see what works? lmao! So, a mess he'll make? I do wonder if on the 7th day Sunshine will decide to delete himself and live happily ever after in the ever afterlife w/ our cute/sexay Cupid Reaper?

here is my theory/hope, I think this is going to be similar to The Butterfly Effect where Sun keeps trying to get with Rain but things go awry. The final awful thing will be that Rain actually dies. If Sun makes himself the 7th person then everyone reappears including Rain. By that point Sun has matured and makes the ultimate self sacrifice so Rain is alive. But then the reaper and Sun will get to be together in the afterlife.

I could really see that the same production company and director as 180 Degrees of Longitude Passes through Us made this. The feeling and cinematography gave me flashbacks to 180 degrees a great deal.

I have to congratulate them on creating a couple that each is appalling in their own way. Rain is a dick for keeping a relationship going when it is plain he is already involved with Air. He didn't seem to feel that bad about breaking up with Sunshine and was real quick to move on with Air. Sunshine implied that Rain likes young guys and I could kind of see it being true.
Sunshine on the other hand doesn't seem to care too much about why he is getting dumped only that he is and it feels more like a pride thing than a love thing.

So far my favorite character is the horny cupid reaper. I think this is the first I've ever seen or read of a "cupid" reaper that I laughed when Kyu introduced himself. I actually think it will be more fun for him to hook up with Sunshine than Rain.

Did anyone else notice the girl on the ground when Sunshine was leaving all his costars adoring fans? I'm wondering where that is going to come back into the story and more likely screw up Sunshine's wishes.

yeah, I was wondering if this was gonna be a Groundhog's Day sort of story and we will keep rewinding and eventually, Sunshine is gonna catch the girl when she falls as a cute sort of gag to show how much he's changed/grown? Hmm.

I'm not completely invested in this show yet but very intrigued. I will keep tuning in for future episodes. I loved 180 degrees longitude and didn't know this was by the same director. I'm expecting/hoping for deep and meaningful character growth, life lessons, and dialogue. I'm not gonna lie, I had to check out this show just for Shogun (Jet). 😍
