Well, this is definitely interesting. Not sure what else he could learn now. I feel like eventually he'll have to admit that he himself is the problem, and then what?

Aaah what is with love /rebirth/horrific dark past(aka death).... And that fortune teller asks Q to fall in love... 😍😍😍😍my ship is sailing aaaaaahh love it.... Beginning of the ep they were sharing their miseries and wow there is tension.... Q×sunshine probable end game😍😍... Rain and sun are not compatible at all... Sunshine let go of him boy...rain tolerates u thats it🤡...

I kinda relate to sunshine as a person who does not care that much about politics 🤡and the aftermath sheesh what in the north korea was that😅...

I really liked this episode with the fortune teller and learning more about Sunshine's parents, They are now on the list for worst parents, especially the mom.


The backstory with the politician and commentary on equality in general and marriage equality specifically was great. Sunshine's behaviour and expressions during that whole scene just highlight how narcissistic he is. I understand not being into politics but this was important to Rain and he didn't take the time to understand why. Again, I come bak to the conclusion that he doesn't really love Rain.

As an aside, I read the book today, it is a short and easy read. I won't spoil it, but I can say there is a lot more depth to the characters in the series although Sunshine is a bit more aware in the book than we see in the show.

Checking in. Is there any actual BL in this series? Or is it like 180 without an actual romance?

lmao! Yes there is. We even got some SunshineRain kissies last episode. But you can tell the director has a theatre background, because much like w/ 180 Degrees there's a lot of 2 characters talking in empty space sort of scenes and monologues. I'm still 80% sure Sunshine and Q are endgame.

I put up with a lot of this and honestly didn't mind it at first in 180 because they gave me abs and clavicles and nakedness. But if NO ONE IS MAKING OUT pre or post these monologues and empty spaces it gets to be bangxiety and I can't do that

there's actually a lot of nakedness in this! There was an entire scene w/ our cute reaper wet and out of the tub talking with Sunshine, and I think it's in Atom's contract to be shirtless/in his underwear every episode.

There is a bl plot and subplots too... I can't say they show much about the lead couple's story ... But it shows more about rain and his exs /and how the lead erases people to bond with rain again

Lol it's not a romance Thoughts, the author even says that in the preface of the novella. It's more about understading that our choices have far reaching consequences, and trying to put our own selfish wants above those we thought we loved, only hurts ourselves and others in the end.

Sunshine is kind of a brat, how long before he realises he's the problem? Cupid and Rain deserve better lmao. Also, if Rain didn't remember/know who Sunshine was in the previous episode, how come the landlady was asking about him? Am I on crack?
