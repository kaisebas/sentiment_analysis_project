Atom nailed it this episode, he was loosing me last two I felt he was a little over the top but this episode he nailed it. I am surprised by how quick the series is moving, this is what happens in the novella but i didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be so early, maybe we‚Äôll get some romance.

That song in the episode was fire, going to see if i can find it.

They've released two OST MVs so far

Is it just me or the sexual tension is amping up? Even though I'm pretty sure that is going nowhere.

3 more episodes. What now? The preview is entering an epilogue territory, but 3 episodes are way too long for that.

I saw that coming, but I thought it would be the dreaded 11th episode when it happened, not the 9th. Now, where does the story go? I'm hooked like a tuna.




And, yes, the sexual tension has been dialed up to 11, but there's nowhere for it to go.

That song that keeps getting played by the busker in the park is a banger. Don‚Äôt suppose anyone knows the title/artist?

When Flower Shop Guy said Q came from the past to the future specifically to help Sun, I thought they were going to pull some shit like he's his dad from the past or something, and was preparing myself to be grossed out by the almost-kiss. But, safe for another week, I guess.

I normally hate this kind of indie show, but I really want to know what happens in the end üò¨

Okay so theory (PLEASE tell me if this was obvious and everyone already thought of this but i just finished binging all 9 eps) Q was sun's last lover and Q ereased himself so he chose him so they could get back together

btw i love this series sooo much like .. its a 8/10 from me

this is actually an interesting theory, because iirc Sunshine said Rain was his first bf, which honestly doesn't track w/ how hot and outgoing Sunshine is - but if his ex-bf was erased of course Sunshine wouldn't remember him!
