in my villain era
I like this because it is so unique, is this a BL? No it's really not. The author was upfront about that, the novella is a character study for Sunshine. It a Faustian tale, where the lead happens to have a boyfriend but it really has no bearing on the rest of the plot, it could have been female or male it makes no difference really.

This was an art-house piece, it's a stage play in a series, and I absolutely applaud the whole team and their work, especially Atom and Jet, this whole production hinged on them and they put in a solid performance. Adapting this particular novella was ambitious, but I think the director was looking for the challenge, they aren't pinning it on fan service.

I absolutely think this is worth a watch, it's not going to be for everyone, and the ending is an open/ambiguous one, but if your like me and a fan of the off-beat and outside the norm this will for sure be right up your alley.

Thanks for hosting u/imomen!

This was really something special. I loved how it was a more reflexive work, I've been telling people this should be adapted into a play. I think it would work wonderfully. It was a nice wrap up for Sunshine's story and I just wish we could get a little more of Sun and Sky in their happy place.

Okay someone smarter than me please help me with understanding this.

They both called each other Q at the end so is Q basically the role of the reaper? Was Sunshine the reaper when Q had to choose the candles. Or was Sunshine the last candle that he saved? But then why did he call him Q? Q was the one who wished Sunshine back into the world right? Were things running in parallel timelines so that was when Q relit the last candle???

At the end, Sunshine has all his memories of Q but Q does not correct? How did he get put back in the world when Sunshine wished he was erased, or was it because he wished Q (the role) was erased so Guy was able to be himself? And then the telepathy at the end wasn't telepathy right, they were showing a conversation that they were going to have...

Pretty much. I think Sunshine was both the reaper and the last candle. Like how sunshine chose to use his erasing power to erase his Q, Guy also chose to use his saving power to save his Q (perhaps unknowingly).

But also don't overthink this. It's magic.

From what I understood from the book, was that because both loved each other, they stopped each other from becoming Q, by being Q in each other's realities.

For me I'd easily give it 9/10 the story wow.... So cool... Kudos to the author for creating this masterpiece and the director for embodying it with added elements....i deduct 1 Point.. .5 for slow paced scenes at times and longer scenes (but those elements made me love this show too) and . 5 for not giving more of q nd sunshine /and more of Sky's flashback(with his Q) which is the second book i guess

Also Jared mentioning his love for grandma is a type of love maybe emphasized that Sunshine was a cupid reaper playing cupid for the (father-son bond) love between the son Sky and his dying Dad (paternal love) with candles maybe to symbolize death...

(how's Sky alive.... Did sun (as Q) pray for him after he k worded himself drowning in the riverü§°... From the shadow of Sky's Q I'm 100% sure that it was Sun... Maybe they both begged(prayed) to save each other when they messed up other people's lives and somehow redeemed their mistakes/corrected their lives .... Both sun/sky killed themselves out of pressure tho... Somehow they're back to life because of their Qs/second chance... )

Sunshine-Earth-Air convo was matureüëç... And sunshinesky reunion was the cutest ‚ù§.... I really loved the pair... Somehow their visuals are refreshing and gives off that mature couple vibes... Very different from traditional bl couples

Loved the series‚ù§goodbye 7 days before valentine

It was refreshing to watch something very different and I'm glad I came back to it after falling behind for a few weeks. By the end I was very emotionally invested. I even started crying as soon as that song played, even before we knew Sunshine was crying. Loved Sunshine's development and so happy to see where he ended up.

I mean, I get why the finale is the way it is narratively, but still it's kind of... boring? Sure, sure, he's a changed man. Now find your guy and kiss already!

The final scene is super cute though. Though it sure feels like they ran out of budget at the very end üòÖ, but I'll take it.

Okay, I watched it and I liked the ending. There were some plot holes and some sloppy writing, but overall, I really enjoyed it!

Was there anything to the airport scene and the two little boys, and how the camera focuses on the remaining boy after Sunshine walks by? Or was it just filler for the voiceover?
