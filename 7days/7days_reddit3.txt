Ok this is my dark horse of 2023, I was not expecting this, 3 episodes in and I'm in love. This is far more evolved from the novella, and I'm here for it. The colouring, the sets, and the camera work, its all very intentional.

The self-aware acknowledgment of this being a Faustian tale, and honestly, it's done so effectively. You can tell the director has a background in stage, it feels like a stage play in the blocking, the suffocating feeling of the apartment, and even the dialogue, but the novella is mostly dialogue it lends itself well to the medium.

Flowers to Atom as well, his character in Bake Me Please is very one dimensional, and the first two episodes here were a little rocky but this episode showed some acting chops I was solidly impressed.

I am absolutely doing a source vs series post on this one.

It's also wacky, dark, romantic and different. I'm glad Atom is getting a chance to shine.

Are we gonna get a bathtub scene everytime Sunshine makes a wish? Because I approve!

This episode is virtually all narration. I applaud them for making it still dynamic. If this was in any other random BL, this much narration would probably be much drier.

Jared is so creepily adorable.

This is getting interesting! I thought we were gonna have seven people disappear, but it's more fun this way.

I guess the three of us watching are really enjoying it!

I like that I have no idea what will happen. The plot is plotting and the boys are hot.

So If I understood well, every time Sunshine makes a new wish, his last wish gets cancelled? That means that Air is fine and well with his father?

For the way I see it Rain's partners until now have been awesome people like Air who took care of his father and Now Mek who fights against injustice and discrimination.

I think the problem here is Rain who seems to have been using Sunshine all this time and of course Sunshine, for not accepting that it's all over between them.
Sunshine's refusal to speak about his parents probably is a great hint of where his abandonement issues come from and why he can't let Rain go.

Interesting. I'm in the middle of episode three and glad to see that plot twist. Air was so green flag.

To tell the truth, although Sunshine is immature, until now I dislike Rain more, he used an inexperienced boy younger than him as a rebound while he treasured the memories of his ex, and when he felt that they were not compatible he entered into a new relationship with the son of a client, without ending their existing relationship, the guy dumped Sun a week before Valentine's Day and immediately posted a photo of their affair after the breakup!. 

Sunshine is definitely deleting the wrong people.

I despise Grandpa boxers. Atom this episode made me appreciate them. 41 years of loathing those things and he had me at "Mek".

Well, Sun really is going to make a bigger mess out of his life week after week. He really doesn't understand that our lovers and friends change us even to a small degree.

His choice this week is going to change Rain in ways that may screw his goal up to the nth degree.

Also how lovely was this dialogue driven plot? Somjet and Boxerboy Atom carried the entire episode on their backs. Fantastic.
