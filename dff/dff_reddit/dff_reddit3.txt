Almost the entire episode I was more terrified of Fluke rather than the actual masked murderer💀

Why on earth was he acting so scary. Who yells and shakes a guy who is already bleeding to death?

Plus the way he looked and talked to White when he saw him playing the disk.

Luckily from the look of next week he returns to normal😂

That masked murderer movements come off as laboured and stiff. I think if they all weren't so terrified they could overpower him.

- My guess is that it's actually Top under the mask. There might be some sort of possession/spirit transference thing going on, like a summoning with the altar and the blood (like with how Por has been bleeding from the eyes, then sleeping, and now seizing) That's just me throwing a prediction out there.

- The locations in this show are gorgeous. The cabin is both lush and lovely, but also has that perfect isolated horror cabin feel, and the woods around it are also stunningly, and yet feel claustrophobic. And the temple is beautiful but eerie. The location scouts NAILED it.

- White is my fave character. He's peak Final Girl. I also love that he and Tee feel like a real couple. There is a lot of casual touching when they are around, which we don't often get in BLs unfortunately. I believe that Tee's love for White is genuine, like in the last episode got scared and swept up in Top's hysteria, but when he thought of White, he realized what he was doing, and how his first thought wasn't to save his own skin, but to run to White, even though it was running towards the killer.

- Top is Panicky Idiot #1 ("Sorry, we're looking for a duh-duh idiot" - IYKYK), but Fluke is Suspicious Idiot #1. Not only does he not know anything about police procedure (I don't like to give cops a ton of credit, but they DO know how to deduce when fingerprints are on a body incidentally and rule people out???), but being a creepy weirdo isn't helping your case, bro. I kinda like Top even though he's hysterical (honestly, can't blame him - everyone likes to think they would be calm and collected in a horrific situation, but that's actually not the norm), but Fluke can totally be the next person to die. There's always at least one hella annoying character in an ensemble slasher that you're glad when they have a gruesome death. Axe Murderer, do you thing.

- Is it gay if you hide from a slasher in a coffin with your bro whose dick you just bit the day before? Asking for a friend.

FULLY AGREE- Fluke is being sO CREEPY. I hope White is final girl but I am so scared he’s gonna be an early out. I feel like Jin and Phee are definitely solid as final couple/ final 2

Filler episode this week gang, no time stamps required 😞 no spice no sexy

White is my favorite, I like a character in a horror with common sense. He was giving me bimbo vibes before but he’s pretty collected.

All the tropes again this week could have bet money Tee would fall 😂

I was hoping we’d get more backstory this week, but looks like we’re just tension building and red herrings. It’ll come!

We end in a cliff hanger this week as well, nicely played.

I'm of the belief that final girl is final girl regardless of gender Comment Image

I feel the same way about White!! He pays attention, he's smart, and he's brave - he knew it was risky to go and try and watch the video but he did it anyway.

I'm really enjoying this!! It's a bit campy at times (and this was more on display this week imo) but I get the feeling that this was done pretty low budget, haha.

My favourites so far are Phee, Jin and White, but I really need to know more about Phee and Jin's background because right now I'm very ??? about what happened between the two of them!

I like the campiness because it makes it feel even more like a classic 70s/80s teen slasher

White should be protected at all costs. I don't know how I feel about Tee: he's been falling out and in of my good side. At least he's going back and he was all MY FAEN. And I'm also rooting for JinPheen. I hope now that they are locked in that coffin they'll talk things out and kiss. 👀

This story is giving me Ten little indians vibes.

Well, now the killer is just not scary anymore 🤷‍♂️. Him taking the motorbike, especially. It's a mundane sight that I never expect to see in a horror.

But he's different from the spirit, no? So hopefully there's still some horror left.

I loved the camp of it made me giggle just casually getting on the motorbike.

Now it could be one of the boys in disguise, like a misdirect but I’m guess it’s probably Non.

I'm curious, what makes you say this? The slasher genre is old-school horror, actually. Some of it reminds me a bit of the Scream series.

Which part?

The one about the killer being not scary is just how I feel at this point. I don't really watch horror so I have no point of reference. That said, in my imagination, you wouldn't see how a killer get from one place to another; they just appear and disappear. So watching him get on that motorbike feel scooby doo-y.

The one about the spirit, it's because it seems that the shadow-y hand that was involved in ep 1 sexy times is unrelated to this killer.

It depends on the type of horror, sometimes there is the element of the unknown but sometimes you see them doing 'mundane' things. The fear factor comes from the fact that their identity is unknown and that they're trying to kill the main character, for example. Here I think they're also adding a heavy dose of mystery, so the suspense comes from that more than from watching what they're doing. But there's also a 'teen-slasher/camp' element that's a factor here.

As for whether or not there's a 'spirit', we'll have to see! it'd be unusual if they mixed genres but they may very well be, BOC is known to do things like that.

Oh God, Fluke trying to kill Por shaking him up and moving the branch in the chest to shut him up it's something I didn't expect. Clearly they did something horrible to Non and they're shitting bricks for it.

White has been my favourite this week, I like that under that apparent fragility he has the brains.

At least it's clear that the murderer it's human, that slopiness fighting and then running away with the motorbike tell clearly he is not a spirit 😂😂😂.

I know it's unlikely considering the situation but I would love if Jin and Phee have sexy time in the coffin 🥵🥵🥵😂😂

Is this series worth checking out? I’m currently watching The Sign and Pitbabe. I also just watched KinnPorsche for the first time so now I’m trying to find other series to get hooked on.
