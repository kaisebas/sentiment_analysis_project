I shouldn't be laughing but omg White 😭😭 i have no idea how he could be involved in this but I sure hope he has good reasons to be caught up in the revenge scheme otherwise......... imagine if he really just wanted to hang out with his boyfriend 😭😭😭 he signed up for a nice little getaway with his lover and instead everyone's just losing their minds and dying 😭😭

That would be so fucking hilarious in a gallow's humor way if that were true, but I just can't think that Sammon would leave this one character without the same levels of grey and nuance as every other character. Also, there is that line that still sticks out to me as weird from the first episode where Tee says that White promised he would be obedient if he came to the cabin. Like... huh? We know that Tee's a bastard (he's still my fave character though), but he doesn't seem controlling of White. He melts to whatever White says and seems more jealous when other boys touch him.

One thing I've wondered is that Joe said "Non paid off his debt". In gangster world, we know that usually means prostitution. Perth's character could also be a sex worker (forced or not) that comes into contact with Non. Maybe White is similar?

During the all-out brawl when Top was beating the crap out of Tee, White's face shifted from petrified to something like happiness for a couple seconds. However, in the next shot he’s back to looking scared again. Since the cult doesn’t seem to be a factor in the show so far, it’s looking less likely that White could be part of the cult and more likely that he’s connected to the mafia. I wonder if he genuinely cares about Tee at all or if he’s at the house to enact vengeance on someone else’s behalf, like Tee’s uncle. With the revelations about Phee and Tan, we know that every character (except White) in the house has their own agenda and secrets they’re hiding from somebody else.

I’m super curious about White’s identity at this point given that 2/3 of the new “friends” are infiltrators with ulterior motives. If Phee’s goal is to gather information and Tan/New’s is to instill fear and confusion to force a confession, what could be driving White? In the first episode it’s mentioned 3 times that he really wants to recreate the movie and implores Tee to go along with Phee and New’s suggestion. Since Tan, the biochemistry major, is drugging them and inducing hallucinations, is White, the computer engineering major, responsible for cutting the phone lines and tampering with the walkie talkies? There’s a couple instances where they seem to be closer than expected. In episode 3, Tan says he heard something and White tells him to have some water. Tan replies that he heard something for real, as if he was trying to communicate with White. When they’re looking for the hard drive he suggests that he and White go explore a room he found under the stairs, and at one point he grabs White’s hand as they run out of the room. White, Tan/New, and Non are also the only characters in the show’s poster who aren’t splattered with blood, although he does have a few specks on his face. The implications of his name make his identity even more interesting. In Western literature the color white symbolizes purity and innocence but also serenity, light, and the all-knowing truth. And the flip side to white is black, which is what the Masked Killer wears. So many questions…

White also had his worst fear revealed as STD (the blisters) so I think he might maybe be a prostitute that Tee met that way? Or he is on drugs? I think he has some connection to the mob and that's how he met Tee,

The one on the scooter right? With the drug in play, it is possible that was a hallucination. They will take the sheet off the body and find out there is nothing underneath.

It’s possible that the uncle drove all the boys (including Non) to the house and lied to the police afterwards, so the killer(s?) would have a reason to target him.

I have been rewatching episode 1 now that we know what we know…White is definitely in on it with Phee and Tan.

They nod to each other in the first 10 mins of the show when Phee puts on the film that they made.

Just the way the original ones nod to each other before the video is played. Not sure how they are linked but he is not there by chance in my opinion! 😳

Plus he is also keen for them to remake / continue the previous film. He is vocal about that with Tan & Phee. Oh! I cannot take the twists and turns!!!

Maybe White has a family member who got caught up in Tee’s uncle’s business. That could be the link.

Cause of death: The Heart Killers ❤️‍🔥🔪
I'm still reeling from that NC scene. OMFG that was good.

But this comment is about the story and boy did we get some answers. So Tan is New which is great casting because he kinda looks like Non . I've believed for a while now that this wasn't about ghosts but some other twisted story and I'm glad this is the route Sammon took. We have answers about the things they have been experiencing and I'm here for it.

I wanna hug Tan TBH because he's been through a lot but that smile at the end... Ugh. The quiet part was the drug won't kill them but I sure hope they do themselves . This is a villain I can get behind.

I still believe we're missing a piece of the puzzle and that piece is White. I'm not buying he's just a sweet bystander .

Can I get more obsessed with Ta? I don't think I can but I'm willing to be proven wrong. 🙌🏻

The part about hoping they do. That was the vibe I was getting too. Tan/New I also saw coming but I’m still living for it. White was wearing the same uniform as Phee’s before he went undercover so I’m assuming White must know Phee in some capacity?? Unless he’s just an innocent bystander but given the plot, doesn’t make sense.

Also Ta being double cheeked up is not what I expected but that was one of the better NC scenes I’ve seen recently (granted I’m super new to BL so maybe there’s better idk 👀)

I'm hoping for an 11th hour twist with my Final Girl White.

The twist in today's episode makes me think of the movie Shrooms, and it explains quite a bit, but it felt like it telegraphed the rest of the series. Really hope they have more in store. Sammon though can be hit and miss.

Triage novel was better but, the series was better.

I am excited for Spare Me Your Mercy, it's by far her best book, and track record shows the adaptation will be even better I have high hopes.

I think there still might be something supernatural going on, or it's not all just NewTan. Remember the first time they went to the mansion to film, Por saw something behind the shrine when he was filming, and it vanished. This was long before any drugs came into play and Non was still very much around.

No, me neither. I can't say what I'd do in that situation. I have a really bad temper, so it would probably be something similar. He's in Scorched Earth mode because there is NOTHING left for him. He gave up his real schooling in England, his parents sold their home so he has no real home anymore, both parents are dead, and Non is either dead or missing. He has no future and no hope and nothing to cling to other than revenge.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Another fucking week of losing my mind with theories!

- It was in the back of my mind that it was a drug induced haze. So, if New/Tan's drug induces their worst fears and secrets, what's up with White seeing boils all over himself?

- Fuck, I feel so bad for New. He lost *everything*. All he has his is cold, cold revenge to wrap himself in at night. He's become a Batman villain, plotting his revenge in his chemistry lab.

- We still know NOTHING about White. We see him briefly and he's already Tee's boyfriend, but how did they meet? He goes to a different school. Was it a dating app like how Phee and Non met? Still SO many questions there. And there was that one weird moment when they were filming the redo of the movie where Phee held White's hand and they had a moment. Was it just because of "Oh, that's Tee's boyfriend and Tee is very jealous", but then Phee purposely had Jin caressing White for the take, knowing it would make Tee hit the roof.

- What if there's more to what's going on with Jin? We see that while he took the video, there is definite probable evidence that he didn't leak it, since his laptop shorted out. So, Non 'betrays' him. Then he develops feelings for someone else, and Phee rejects him. Honestly, the pain in Jin's eyes when Phee shut him down was such good acting on Copper's part. You could see his heart breaking. What if he's like 'fuck all these people for forgetting about Non, and fuck Phee and Tan for going behind my back' (is what he thinks since he's convinced that Phee and Tan were screwing).

- Keng still alive?? In the preview for next week, we see what could be him (he's wearing the watch) with Joe and his goons. But, it could also be Perth's character, since he's also got the blondish hair. And when we see the hands holding up the mask, it's a similar shirt cuff to the shirt that Keng? is wearing.

- I think that there's definitely more than one revenge plot going on here. And there still might be supernatural things happening - when they went the first time to the mansion for filming, Por saw the masked figure hiding behind the shrine when he filmed it, and there was no drugs in play there, and Non was still around, so there was no reason for revenge on anyone's part other than Non.

- Wow, that was an NC scene. Ass slaps and blow jobs and thrusting and nudity and everything. And Phee definitely caught feelings for Jin, and then seeing the article about Non's disappearance made him realize that he really was cheating on Non, and it wasn't just fucking him for info. The part at the lake where Phee was describing Non was so sad.

EDIT: Also, watching that NC scene again (for research purposes of course of course), they were framed in the window - not only was it just a cool shot cinematically, but what if someone saw them?

The boils thing I wonder if that's White's worst fear? maybe an STI? I've always wondered if he's involved with the mafia as a prostitute and that's when he meets Non . In the preview next week we see Non and the teacher on the rooftop with the mafia wearing the same clothes as the photo on the news article about them running away on a bus together which leads me to think they are both still alive You could be right about Keng.

I also was wondering for that path for White. Perth's character has yet to be shown more and I think he's in the same path. When Joe said Non's 'working off his debt', we know what that means when a mafioso type says that - forced prostitution. And that would kind of align with how jealous Tee is of other guys touching White, and how he said 'if you came you said you'd be obedient'.

There was a scene when Tee went to visit the mafia guys and there was a young looking boy with the men. I've wondered about White since then. I get the feeling Phee or Tan didn't plan the trap in the woods for Por or any killing. I think Tan wanted to drug them for confessions and it's icing on the cake that they are attacking each other. So theres one or two masked people running around and we've already seen if given a weapon Non will use it plus the ideas are straight out of his script. We don't know much about Keng, why was he trying to get into the mafia casino? Is he the one capable of beheading poor scooter guy? Can't wait for next week!

Saturdays have become the day where I spend hours refreshing my iQIYI app so I can watch DFF as soon as it’s available and wow… today’s was so much. Tan being new wasn’t a surprise per se but given how many questions we’ve had about him this whole time, we got some answers!

White is still a mystery. He ~seems to be an innocent bystander but… He had on the same uniform as Phee did before switching schools and my thought is he potentially knew Phee beforehand in some capacity?? Otherwise he’s just being traumatized wanting to spend time on vacation with his partner which really sucks 💀

I also have to give Copper his due credit. We knew Ta would serve, it’s not his first rodeo as far as being in a series but wow he and Copper served. As soon as that first slap connected, I knew this was serious. Ta being cheeked up twice in one series was not what I expected tbh. Jin’s reaction to Ta makes so much sense now.

This show is working my brain overtime and I have more thoughts but I’ll leave it at this is one of my favorite shows period so far and I hope the momentum keeps up!

Hi me again, still working this episode/show through my brain. I wanted to mention the writing of the show here because I see so many parallels between character interactions and my mind goes to generational trauma and how that gets passed on. And I see a lot of that written in a way that’s realistic and that isn’t shy about looking at how each character’s own histories influence the cycles of trauma/pain being inflicted which makes some of the decisions made make sense —even if they aren’t the best however you might want to define it. Some BLs I’ve seen (I’m new to them so my experience here is limited lol) are very surface level, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but I just really appreciate the depth given to DFF. I might be rambling here but yeah wow… this show… it’s a good one.

Considering how all the other characters are, I just can't see Sammon not giving White some more nuance and grey and layers since every other character has it. There is the definite desire to freeze in traumatic situations, but sometimes he seems very calm and other times he's freezing up or being generally clumsy (maybe purposefully??) I think there is definitely more to the story there.

I noticed that too. Phee said he was unsure that they'll make it out, so it seemed like their plan had gone out of control somehow. Tan's plan involved hallucinogens only rather than murder, unless he had planned further without Phee's knowledge. I think Phee and Tan aren't the only ones plotting revenge.

I went back to that altercation and you are absolutely right. There was a brief moment where White's expression didn't look frozen but more exhilarated somehow? He had a bit of a grin on his face as Tee was getting pummeled. And then went into frozen, and then moved to help him. White as more than final girl, and the one who actually was punishing them would be interesting! And we know Sammon loves her crazy twists, stuff that is completely off the radar.

Didn’t expect Tan/New to be just as unhinged as Non. But both of their parents are dead so I guess it makes sense.  Phee does have feelings for Jin, so I wonder what’s gonna happen when they find out the truth about everything. The PheeJin NC scene was hot!

Wow! This was a much-needed episode. Us viewers finally get confirmation on a lot of theories and speculations built up over the last few episodes.

Non’s family is all-the-way tragic. I know a lot of the responsibility falls on the parents for how they turned out but adding variables such as their socioeconomic status, the corrupt justice system, society’s poor regard for mental health, it’s hard not to feely pity towards this family. Watching the mom was just so heartbreaking.

Finally we get to know Tan after him being missing from all of act 2. I’m surprised to see that he’s a more important character than I initially thought. The biggest question mark we have now is White and I hope that he’ll be more than just a boyfriend that gets accidentally caught in a crossfire of revenge.

I wonder what Phee and Tan’s end game is. After the bullies expose themselves, then what? It definitely feels like there’s a bigger fish to fry than just the bully crew. Something’s going on that’s beyond the revenge duo’s control. I’m so curious!

Yeah, I also feel there is something else going on besides just what Phee and Tan have going on. I also feel that NewTan is on another level of revenge than Phee wants. He's got nothing left and is doing an extended suicide. Phee asked if the drug would hurt them, and NewTan assured Phee it wouldn't - but I'm not so sure. And I wonder if Phee also has things going on that he's not telling Tan. The whole thing with Tee's uncle and his death still has to be answered.

We got a lot of questions answered, but I feel like those questions brought up more questions! God, I love this show.

Well Phee definitely took his role of becoming Jin's friend to get information seriously. Even tried to slap the information out of him..


Seriously though, I'm loving all of your theories. 100% there is more to White and I can't wait to find out what. Phee clearly likes Jin but had to support Tan and his villainous plan (that lab though LOL). I think it's amazing how well they kept Tan in the background until now. Ahh this show is so good.

I'm sorry but Tan's evil scientist lab with evil green lighting is kinda funny in the campy way.

I need answers about White immediately! He is too suspicious. Since Phee told Jin that he wasn't sure if they'd make it out alive either, him and Tan's plan must've gone out of control, and/or there must be some other plan in motion that he wasn't aware of.

It's pretty clear that Tan had dragged Top to the cult building and drugged him, but are his hallucinogens able to mind-control Top to become the masked murderer and kill Por? That seems implausible and I think there are other factors at play.

And we still don't know who caused Por's knife marks, Por being led to get stabbed by the branch, and the Uncle who was beheaded. Question is, did Tan do it? I'm certain that he was involved somehow, but whether he involved in all of it or if there was another party is another question.

This episode delivered so muuuch I'm happy!

First of all, this episode finally answered something for me: what set all of this off. We've known since early on that the events in the past were quite some time ago, which always left me wondering why the time gap and why Phee (and whoever else, before today) acted now.

We finally got the answer to that question at the end of this episode with the reveal about Non and New's parents. In New's eyes he has nothing left at this point and he's riddled with guilt and rage. Even in the past he was clearly driven by both, but they'll be even worse now that he's also lost both his parents. I can only imagine the sense of responsibility that weighs on him because with each and every one of them there's a theme - he's not there.

Which begs the question: what has he been doing for the past two years? He didn't go back to his normal life, that much is clear from his conversation with his father, but he also hasn't been around. In the preview for the next episode it shows a figure mixing something, seemingly surrounded by the same hangings we've seen around the cult stuff - did New get drawn into the cult?

Now, let's go to the other major arc in this episode - Phee & Jin.

As soon as the cast started asking 'is PheeJin real' last night it confirmed for me that Phee had been in it mostly for info, so I wasn't really surprised.

HOWEVER. I am deliciously, pleasantly surprised by what this episode delivered in terms of PheeJin crumbs.

First of all: it's clear that Phee's actions are driven by a desire for information rather than revenge. I know that some people have speculated that having sex with Jin was a revenge tactic but I have to ask - revenge for what...? At this point all he knows is that Non was involved with the group before they disappeared and that they stole his script. Would he really go to the lengths of deliberately seducing someone based on that?

Now, that's not to say that doing it for information only is much better, but there's still a key difference there. One is designed to get close and find out more, the other is designed to hurt. And everything that Phee did in this episode seems geared more towards the first rather than the latter.

I'm also not convinced that Phee actually had sex with Jin for information only because - having told New that he's slept with Jin to get closer and to get information - what does he do? Does he use that tactic to spend more time with Jin? Perhaps try to go out on dates with TeeWhite or the rest of the group to exploit his connection? Try to ask Jin questions about Non?

Nope! Instead he promptly pulls away fast, and hard - and that tells me that maybe the sex wasn't about information at all - OR that he realizes that he can't keep staying that close to Jin without getting in over his head. His actions simply do not jive with someone who is trying to use having sex with Jin for information or revenge. Keep in mind that he simply does not know enough at this stage to match a 'I'm going to break Jin's heart' goal.

Now, as to what's going on in the present - we see a few other things. We see Phee trying to call Jin, and my first thought was 'oh, this will be when he suggests that they get together' - because that would track with Phee's professed goal of using Jin for information. But that didn't happen! Jin didn't answer, but also - Por is the one who suggests the trip! Not only that, but we then see Phee trying to see Jin in person... And then in the scenes out at the cabin, we see him seemingly getting really worried when Jin starts hallucinating.

Now there's a small chance that Phee is going to use this to try and get information from Jin - I wouldn't really blame him, tbh. But with his overall behaviour, etc, I think it's clear that Phee is more conflicted than he'd like to be about Jin.

Other thoughts and observations:

at the end of the episode we see a preview and at the very end of it we see two things: Non and someone else (probably Keng) lying down, and then a shot of Tee - and guess what? Tee's clothes are the ones that he wore during the interrogation scene in the last episode, which is AFTER the boys had gone back to town and people realized that Non had disappeared. We only learned just last week that Tee was directly involved in Non's disappearance in the first place, but now we're learning something else on top of that - he saw Non after all the other boys did. To our knowledge, he may be the only other person who has.

it's hilarious that Phee ends up going to school in Jin's uniform which has his name on it. Like can you imagine hahaha. That's how Tan knows that he slept with Jin.

I think that's it for now but I'm sat and hoping that this show continues to go the direction I think it might because we've got all the crumbs brewing for a delicious conflict.

Oh, and also - I'm still soooo curious about White, because we didn't even see his backstory, yet. What's the deal with our innocent boy? And when are we going to find out about Perth!!

When I heard that first spanking sound, I was deadly wounded, then we got Phee's butt front and centered and it was the coup de grace.

gonna get this out of the way and say I want more NC scenes with Ta!!! my god I actually think I had an out of body experience when he slapped Jin's ass not once but TWICE!! and then gave us a whole shot of his backside 😩🥵 that man is serving in every damn episode!! Phee is also so so boyfriend material the way he takes care of people (Non/Jin/New) ughhhhh I guess I'm a Ta stan now 🤷🏻‍♀️ ❤️

now for plot stuff — I think we all knew (New?) Tan's connection with the group so the reveal didn't seem surprising, though I will say I'm impressed by how New portrays himself as Tan vs how he actually is — definitely two different personalities.

I'm curious if the PheeJin romance is gonna follow the trope of 'I initially pursued you for ulterior motives but then caught feelings and now I must push you away but we'll eventually come back to each other' and somehow overcome the reveal that Jin was the recorder of the video (even if he didn't leak it) 🤔

Non's parents...omg what tragic situation for this whole family :( New/Tan losing his whole family in 3 years and he still couldn't find anything about Non.

So it looks like drugs were the reason that drove the events at the cabin and not actual paranormal stuff — I had a feeling that was the case but does this mean Tan also orchestrated the uncle's beheading and Por's impaling as well? Those were pretty gruesome and it's hard to believe he would go that far with his plans.

Preview for next week looks so intense, how many eps do we have left?! I'm not ready for this to be over 😩😩😩

Considering both his parents killed themselves, I think Tan did orchestrated uncle and por's death, he has nothing left to lose no reason to live other than vengeance and he might as well plan to kill himself after all is done. I think he planned some things on his own without Phee knowing

Man, this gets extra hot, then extra dark. But at least now we kind of know what's going on.  

More importantly, is his butt always that big and I just never noticed? Or is it just the angle? That's the real mystery.

Anyone else feel like they need an emotional support group/animal/hug after this? It's not just me right?

This show is dragging us through the ringer emotions wise. I went into this expecting a horror show and what it's delivering is so far beyond just a simple horror show.

They also didn't show what happened to Phee and Non during that convo so I'm not sure if it's going to become relevant or whether they just overlooked it/cut it.

Yeah, I was disappointed that episode 7 didn’t pick up right where epi 6 left off. Like Jin was heading towards the house, and Phee was already there with Non. Also they never talked about Non’s suicide attempt either. Nothing. That’s frustrating for me.

So as I expected the plan was to investigate what happened to Non, Tan being New was a good little surprise, I was thinking it was a possibility when he was introduced last week.

They've finally clarified the timeframe, bigger gap then I'd thought, that two year jump was a big one. Certainly took a dark turn at the end of the episode.

I wish we hadn't got the big exposition dump though, sort of took the fun of speculation out it. It dose sort of remind me of the movie Shrooms (solid Irish horror film)

Ta is single handedly pulling off what entirety of Playboyy cannot.

Trigger warning ⚠️ : suicide

5:16 - jump scare 💀

29:50 - whooooo finally some spicy...and boy oh boy.... 🔥🔥🔥

Ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
I'm assuming most people noticed this, but when Tan asks Phee if he's cheating on Non, Phee is wearing Jin's shirt.

One thing that really irks me is that in episode 1, Tan and Phee ask about the short film as if they've never heard of it and one of them says that they never finished it. Obviously, they did finish it and even showed it to people and Phee and Tan mention it to them multiple times in this episode.

I definitely don't think that Phee was fully aware of everything that Tan/New is planning for the cabin. Do we know who brought the gun up? Still curious to see what happened that got the uncle decapitated (unless he somehow faked that to add to everyone's paranoia and fear).

Now that we know so much more about all the backstory, I want to go back and rewatch the first few episodes with all the new context and see what I've missed. Also now that I can actually tell the characters apart.

Also, currently on Team "Non and Keng are still alive".

This show is bonkers, and I’m ok with that. I was waiting on this episode most (besides Non’s arrival of course). I’ll go down the list.

Likes:

Phee - I’m in ❤️ with his character, but I love Ta so I’m biased. But Phee is less intense about the revenge than I thought he’d be, like he’s so calm and level headed about this. He seems to be trying to assess the situation as a whole and not jump to conclusions. He should be a cop like his dad.

Phee/Jin - I. Wasn’t. Prepared. 😳. But they’re 🔥, I just wish the scene was shot more from the side. I wanted to see more of Coppers body, plus I wanted to get a good look at their kisses too. Also, I got the impression that was their only time together, and it ended just as soon as it began. If so, that’s 💔. This probably went on for awhile, I just wish I knew how long. The scene at the river (idk, lake?) was really lovely, calm, and warm. I loved how Phee described Non to Jin. ❤️❤️

Tan - Mio. Was. 🔥. He said, “Oh y’all wanna see me? Get ready!” Surprised in the best way possible. This poor family has carried so much sadness and heartbreak, it’s like they were cursed or something. Mental health issues run in the family, so I’d be losing my marbles too. He’s the one who’s really out for blood. The scene with him/Non was 😭. I dig how direct he is with the questions, he doesn’t beat around the bush whatsoever.

White - I’m convinced he’s an innocent bystander who’s there for a good time, not a long time 😂. But he’s definitely the final girl, he’s smart but just scared to death bc DUH! Plus, I think it’s Perth’s character who was behind the door at the police station, and he’s investigating the horse account. Otherwise, White could be pulling a 21 Jump Street.

The quick exchange between Top/Tan about the test. “You didn’t study dumbass.” 😛

Dislikes:

The show subverts my predictions/expectations, but I’m not completely satisfied. It’s like the episodes are a meal, I’m getting the calories, and there is flavor. But it’s not enough, so I’m not fully satisfied.

So am I to believe that Phee gives the game away to Jin bc HE FEELS GUILTY about the drugs?!? Is that how this goes down show? Huh? That’s not satisfying for me.

I just really wanted a reveal (either by accident or intentional) to the whole group all at once. I wanted all the shock that comes with it. I wanted anger, drama, 💔, tears, yelling, fighting. I wanted Por to know the truth before he died, cause he was an awful person! I guess we may still get a scene like that but 🤷‍♀️.

I just wanted ALL of these asshats to know that Non has people who love him. They weren’t there when it counted (which is eating them up inside), but if the group thought this was put behind them, it NEVER was. I wanted that flavor more than anything for this show.

Real world talk: They ALL deserve prison time, and Non would go to a mental health facility (he did try to kill these guys).

Unfortunately, Phee/Tan would get the worst of it. If the drugs are the cause, they inadvertently caused Por to die cause he was drugged. Now, the uncle is another story bc who set up the damn wire cutter? Was it Top? Tan?

I really don’t think there’s a supernatural element at all going on here, it’s all smoke and mirrors, and they’re hallucinating all this stuff.

Each week I am amazed.

Since episode 5 we are in a rollercoaster that gives everything. We have answers and new mysteries, things connect like a jigsaw. Some things we anticipate and some we don’t. It is so good. Gastronomic serie.

New is Tan is good. We were all still wondering so much. Mio can finally shine and, honestly, for someone who did not want to act, who just wanted to be like Jeff Satur and do music… that boy served. They all do, but I am so happy with his part.

The family drama is terrible. The tiny things accumulating : forgetting about your siblings because your own struggles are more important. Comparing your children. Wanting the best for them and being absent in the process. These four people loved each other as families (well except from Non to New, because New never invested in their relationship and also probably jaleousy). The parents fighting but loving each other so much. The many regrets… the mother’s regret in berating Non. The father’s regret in hitting Non. New’s regret in being too absent, first from Non’s life but then he does the same to his parents. The father’s regret to have doted on New, forgetting Non in the process, all this to end up with New not being worth it (not really but I am voicing his feelings) and Non gone. True tragedy, and we all feel like it will not end well for New. Will Non actually be the last one standing? (Yes I am in denial my boy will come back).

Also the realisation that Tan and Phee know NOTHING. They know there are two scripts and that one (the last one found in his room) is from Non. They know Non had sex with the teacher. And they are vaguely aware of the horse accounts. Everything else WE know they don’t. No wonder they (at least Phee) are still testing water.

Phee is such a lovely boy. Rightful. Warm. Also horny 😂 Ta is doing so well I hope he gets some recognition for his work here. And I am not only talking about the NC which was incredibly hot (no wonder they joke about their intimacy). He deserves to rise in the rank at BoC (they don’t have ranks but you know what I mean).

I am looking forward to Phee’s emotional journey because he is at a tipping point. Wouldn’t it be terrible for Non to come back now that Phee seems to have decided to go for Jin, spurred by his future departure ? Yes 2 years ago Phee was still in love but what of now?

The mystery around White thickens. So he arrived in between and we see him already being lovey dovey with Tee so their thing is long term. Bump’s MV revealed a lot of their future scene so following flashback will concentrate on TeeWhite I am so pumped

Also the preview ?? Whose voice is screaming about Non? Will Phee and Jin die for each other or is Jin truly the final girl like in the movie? Will their relationship overcome all the revelations coming? Is Perth protecting Non or just.. IDK I need to know more about that scene…

I'm late to the post but DAMN this series keeps surprising me and I have no clue what to expect next.

I expected Phee to try and get close to Jin but I didn't expect him to take him to his spot he took Non and then did THAT with him all of a sudden when he took him home. 🫣🫣🫣 BRUH

Also totally called "Tan" being NON'S bro. Their whole family was so fcked up and sad ugh. Now I can see why everything is the way it is.

I suspected some supernatural shenanigans like...it can't all just be New Using the hallucinations to trick everyone? Bc Por died the same way Non wrote it in his script. 🤔

I'm wicked late to this show and only just caught up, but have to scream into the void somehow bc HOLY SHIT I DID NOT EXPECT THIS SHOW TO HIT THIS HARD. I have no organization really to my thoughts at this point, so I'm just gonna spew my random brain farts into the ether bc I need to release them somehow.

First thought is Barcode. Now, I've never been shy about my distaste for his character and disappointment in his performance in KP. I think Porchay should have had more bite and agency, and I stand by my opinion that Barcode was too young and inexperienced for the role at the time. However, whatever he's done in the meantime, whatever workshops BOC put him through, fuckin worked bc wow is he blowing me away! And in my defense, even when I was wishing they'd casted someone else and written Porchay differently, I always knew Barcode was a good kid and hoped he got as much opportunity as he wanted to work on better projects and in healthier sets away from the disgusting groomer KP writers. I'm so so glad that he got to do this and actually flex those acting muscles he's been quietly building since KP. Non is a wildly complicated character who goes through sooo many changes, yet Barcode is making him so believable and grounded despite the hysterics and crazy scenarios.

Second revelation was Ta. Macau was a pretty minor part of KP, he only had a few scenes, and beyond some thirsting after fans caught on that he's packin a wicked body I don't think he'd really gotten any chance to shine. I certainly hadn't thought much of him since KP. Well that's a serious oversight cus wow is he also acting his tight little ass off in this show too! He doesn't get to hit the sort of extremes that Barcode or Mio do, but he's got me believing all of Phee's motivations and reactions which is what matters. I do think he has mastered chemistry w/ his bl partners a little more than his overall acting, but his romantic relationships are the center of our attention for his character so that's actually a smart thing to focus on. If he can truly make me believe that he adored Non (which he does) and is genuinely conflicted about getting close to Jin for dishonest reasons (which again I'm buying that fully), then I'm less fussed about whether his got exactly the right reaction or line delivery in other scenes.

We've only really had 1 ep of properly getting to know him, but Mio is also killing it so far as Tan/New. I kind of had a feeling that Tan would secretly be tied to Non somehow from pretty early on, and I had Phee's connection spoiled by twitter before I even started binging to catch up, so as soon as they mentioned that Non had a brother studying abroad I kind of knew it had to be Tan. But still, I do really like how they revealed it, and ye gods does my heart break for him when he loses both parents and is overcome by guilt, feeling like he's the real cause of all of his family's deaths.

Although, I wish we'd gotten more of New's decent into drugs and revenge. It just seemed like an abrupt leap from him frolicking w/ the bully gang, surreptitiously trying to get them to spill about Non, to suddenly being 2-3 years later and he's gone all Walter White. Was he already studying chemistry? Where did this idea of drugging them into admitting the truth even come from? What drove him to that extreme? For that matter, as tightly plotted as the rest of the show has been, his whole plan w/ Phee seems very flimsy. How would he even get registered for school w/out his parents knowing? How did he avoid them seeing him for like 3 whole years when they thought he was abroad but really in the same city? Wouldn't the school have recognized him, or did he go to a different high school than Non? Did none of the others in the bully gang get suspicious that he never talks about his family or invites them home? But, they have skipped around quite a bit to reveal things out of order, so perhaps we'll get more info on how this all came together later. Maybe he got the idea from one of Non's stories, or Non's favorite old horror movie.

The other loose end I'm hoping we'll get an answer to soon is wee baby White. He just pops up randomly as Tee's boyfriend (which, sidenote, regardless of how awful they all are it's oddly heartwarming to see that not one of them has a drop of homophobia on display and unquestioningly accepts when one of them starts dating a boy, kind of a fun reversal of the homophobic bully trope), wearing a different uniform so clearly he never went to their school. It doesn't make sense for him to have absolutely no connection to the main plot, but again he never went to school w/ them so it's not very likely that he knew Non. But, I was thinking, maybe he did know Keng. What if he went to school w/ Phee before he transferred, and maybe they were casual friends or acquaintances so he knew Phee had a boyfriend and even saw a picture of them together. He could have been groomed and raped (bc minors cannot consent so it is always rape) by Keng in the past, so when he saw the news about Keng running off w/ Non he went to Phee to explain how predatory Keng was so that Phee won't blame Non anymore, and White decides to join the revenge/truth plan bc he thinks Keng might have been the one to disappear Non so he needs the truth to be sure that Keng won't come back for him when he's done w/ Non or just for closure if Keng is really dead. Or I could be overthinking it and he's really a follower of that suicide cult who stumbled into the jackpot of easy sacrifices lol.

Quick thoughts on the rest of the cast/characters: I fucking hate Top and I really don't like Jet's performance as him, he's really the only purely awful character and I can't stand anyone who only communicates in scream-shouts (thought I'm sure Jet is a lovely guy irl, I just wish someone had taught him how to deliver a line without flailing). I actually empathized w/ Por a lot more before we got the backstory. Even tho he didn't do nearly as much to directly harm Non as Tee and Top have, the whole "boo hoo, my dad might smack me around a bit and I have so much pressure as the son of a politician" really isn't working on me as an empathy tactic bc my eat the rich mentality is too strong lol. Fluke I'm kinda torn on. I kinda feel like we don't know him well enough to buy his whole present day meltdown at the cabin, but I also can't entirely hate him bc he did have kind of the least to do w/ Non's downfall. Though, much like Jin, there's an argument to be made for a silent spectator being worse than an actual assailant. He knows for sure that Top broke the camera and Tee agreed to help cover it up, so he has to have put the pieces together of what Tee put Non through, yet he said nothing bc he is so stuck on that upward social mobility that being a doctor could get him that he won't do anything that might rock the boat. And Jin. Oh you poor lovesick idiot. I'm not really sure why he even stays friends with the bully gang all. It's a bit odd that he repeatedly chooses them over Non, yet claims to be so in love w/ Non that he's devastated by seeing him w/ another boy and enraged enough to post revenge porn when he finds Non being raped by a teacher (which would be child pornography technically). And yet, I do buy that he genuinely falls for Non's awkward charms and creative mind just as much as he falls for Phee's chivalrous kindness and devastating dick. Copper's chemistry w/ both Ta and Barcode is undeniable. In the end Jin is just a dumb teenager in love who follows his emotions but like Fluke is too afraid to rock the boat when it comes to his social circle. Tee has to be the most complex of the bunch, even tho admittedly I don't think Jjay's performance usually reflects that. He's clearly trapped in a really awful situation, but choosing Non of all people to drag down to hell just to save his own ass is a special kind of awful. He seems to be so ready to throw Non under the bus, yet clearly feels guilty later and also appears to be totally whipped for White.

Oh, and maybe someone can answer this question: Why is Non even bullied in the first place? Where did the nickname greasy come from? He doesn't look greasy at all, nor does he really have any other qualities that would normally get a kid bullied. Did they specify somewhere and I just wasn't paying close enough attention? Or maybe that's info we'll get later. I do remember when Phee was asking Non to be his boyfriend he mentioned that Non had a lot of tough times in the past, and he's obviously taking some sort of medication for depression or something. Perhaps he had a public mental health crisis, a breakdown at school that caused the other students to ostracize him bc of the stigma around mental health issues? Or his weird emo stories got leaked to the school and he was branded a weirdo?

Overall, it's wild how they've managed to weave a complex but mostly understandable web with even more complex characters. Even Keng, who only has a handful of scenes but occupies a big presence in the current part of the mystery as a paradoxical predatory rapist and freelance crime investigator. Though, do we know if he was grooming Non as part of his plan to expose the gambling ring, or was that an unplanned manifestation of his worst urges? The technical aspects aren't always ideal, you can definitely tell that they did not have a KP level budget for this, and I still think a lot of the actors needed more time to mature before taking on these roles. But damn the story is hitting all the notes, the pacing is perfect, even the time jumps back and forth are surprisingly easy to follow as long as you're patient. There's still time to fuck up the landing of course. Though tbh I kind of don't care how it ends. Despite all my questions and it being such a mystery-focused show, I'm much more invested in the characters and the experiences of watching it all unfold so I don't think I'll mind however it resolves (or leaves unresolved) everything.
