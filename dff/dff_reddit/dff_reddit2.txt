This week on I Know What You Did Last Songkran! This show is hilarious. There are so many classic stupid horror movie decisions. I do believe that they missed an opportunity for a skin care product placement when White briefly developed those boils.

I love the preview for the next episode. “And there’s an autopsy, we all will be doomed.” Because they might figure out what killed the guy whose head is not attached to his body !

Need sexy time next time.

This one is really great out of context.

This is campy fun for days, every horror trope you can imagine and I love it.

Poor Por just laying on that couch bleeding out, for someone whose been in medical school his first aid is pretty shit.

I do love Asian horror, they're all on board with the ghost business.

And of course we know somthing bad happened in the past, but sadly no spice this week just the usual screaming and running.

Episode 2 - Timestamps 

🔥 = sexy time 💀 = scary/gore time

6:15 - jump scare 💀

27:00 - 27:58 - gory little jump scare 💀

37:06 - beheading 💀

In fairness, there's not a whole lot he can do in this situation. They knew enough not to pull the branch out but beyond that, the kid needs a trauma surgeon and antibiotics to keep from getting septic.

That uncle Deng kill is comical. They really went from a humble impaling to that in a single episode 😂.

Sad that this doesn't have many comments. Enjoying it tho the acting and effects are marginally questionable.

The scare at the end was pretty gross but enjoying the tropes and the characters. The a**hole characters escaping without their friends is irritating but plays into the genre well. Bit sad cuz Tee is so hot and was enjoying the couple but oh well

Still loving that this is a horror show first! Also love that we're seeing the divide between the friends group in the ones that helped film the first video, and the ones that came after - you need a good divide in a large ensemble in a horror flick. And we have the two 'shithead' characters that you always get in horror that are freaking out and are just out for themselves in the Panic at The Motorcycle! duo in Tee and Top. Tee is also hella hot.

I also like that they aren't afraid to show that killer mask in the daytime. Daytime often makes things look less scary (and daylight is obviously less forgiving than dark light), but even in bright light it still looks creepy. I love the exposed teeth and lidless eyes

It's always interesting to see what rules we have in one country that other countries don't follow. In the US, shows rarely have characters with names that start with the same letter, because it's more confusing for the audience to remember who is who. Meanwhile, this show has nine characters, 3 of whom have T names and basically all of whom have 3 letter names. So far there are like 2 characters that I know their actual names versus the nicknames I've given them in my head

Have you ever watched TharnType? That one is even worst. Like 75% of the characters on that show have T names, it’s such a struggle 😂

I hope they take the route of one of the boys being the killer and not the ghost being the responsible.
Up to now Jin is my favourite, he is probably the murderer or at least he is at the center of it.

Phee is probably the main character and the most rational but I don't understand his relationship with Jin. He seems to like him (nice scene in the woods 😛😛😛) but at the same time he is very cocky with him.

Top and Tee I think they won't last too much, today they betrayed the group (even if Tee regretted it with he thought about White) so maybe they'll die stupidly trying to run away or in a fight with the other boys.
