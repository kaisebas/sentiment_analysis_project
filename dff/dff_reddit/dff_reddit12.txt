I really liked New and Non's last scene, for me it was the best moment of this episode. He needed that. I don't mind him being dead at the end cause there was no life after all of this.

He was never coming back. This was extended suicide. He had NOTHING to go back to. New got what he wanted, and even getting shot is kind of what he wanted. He got Non's forgiveness and he can be with his family again.

Man I am actually SO impressed with the ending of the show because they constructed it in a way that allows people to kind of headcanon what they want from it. You can either think of it as Phee and Jin got out but what happened with Non will always haunt them (and Tee is a miserable mess just like his father was) or you can believe that they all died there. There's also the possibility that the ending is the three of them still there, hallucinating, and they haven't actually escaped yet.

So much heartbreak. 'I haven't done anything' becomes so much more meaningful.

New losing sight of 'what Non would have wanted' doomed him in the narrative but they also alluded to what a lot of fans wanted with Non thanking him. A hallucination? Non's ghost? Up to the viewer.

I think it's going to take awhile for me to take all of this in. There are some dropped plotlines and unanswered questions but I'm pretty satisfied with it.

This is a very traditional horror. And a brilliant one at that. They did an amazing job the whole way through. Honestly if it wasn’t for the BL (which really should not be a factor but in a still largely homophobic world is) this could be a mainstream horror gem. Even with the BL this could easily become a horror cult classic. It’s absolutely brilliant, well told story, great actors, the right amount of misdirection and intrigue. It was great from a horror perspective.

This is a very traditional horror.

100% agree, this was a very horror ending, I can think of half a dozen horror media that end with that twist, it's a very common one. The Decent popped into my head (well the one ending) is this a dream or are they dead?

As an avid horror fan I liked they kept the tropes, it didn't matter it was BL that had no bearing on the plot at all, the focus was the story and I was invested.

They acted their socks off this episode especially Barcode who had to die in some gruesome ways. That scene with him in the bathtub, Jesus!

New smoking and smiling with them all passed out around him was probably my favourite scene.

Anyway I guess Non called it. I loved it personally, perfect horror ending.

God forbid a horror series to end with a closed ending like we dont have to do the open ending every time for this kind of genre😭Also I feel like its kinda rushed a bit? Like half of this ep could have happened in ep 11 and the rest for this one plus some extra scenes to have a more cohesive ending but thats just me

Sammon isn't the only one involved, there's also the horror writer, and I think he was the one more in charge of the 'present' eps than Sammon. There's a distinct different feeling between the two.

It's 100% ambiguous because it just depends on how the viewer wants to interpret it. That's how it's an open ending.

I am GAGGED by this finale!! I was ready to throw hands at the time skip because it just felt so abrupt right after all the carnage that happened in the house but that ending really brought me back and I'm really satisfied by the open-endedness of that last scene. I don't think this show was ever meant to have a truly happy ending and I'm glad Sammon didn't try to subvert my expectations.

The hallucinations between all the guys were so visceral and brutal — all their guilt, fear, hysteria, and anger culminating into those scenes of mass murder/mutilation was honestly rough (but secretly satisfying) to watch. If you're squeamish then the last 5 minutes would probably be the only part of the episode without a trigger warning.

Overall I applaud Sammon for bringing this genre into BL and sticking with a non-traditional ending (for BL). Though I'm sad White had to die 😔 He just wanted to hang out with his bf and his friends and he ended up in the crossfire of a crazy revenge plot instead.

Either way I look forward to seeing Sammon's future works and the works of these BOC boys as well — they're all so talented!

This is it gang, we are in the finale!

This has far and away been the most popular thread I've hosted. Thanks for making this a blast, it's been fun to speculate, but all I hope is the finale is wild and we get a twist or two and hopefully some spice.

Will come back and edit with timstamps for the chickens and perverts 😉

Edit: u/TheBookhuntress u/pheonixs1518 you absolutely right cannot do timestamps this whole episode is one giant timestamp so I'll do trigger warnings;

‼️ gore, blood, suicide, drug use, sexual assault, explicit violent imagery‼️

I'm alright with the ending, that was a very traditional horror ending. It's not an original horror ending, it's a pretty common trope that the end wasn't really the end and they were still in it (Decent, Truth or Dare etc)

Loved the ride though that first 25ish minutes was everything I want in a horror finale just everything.

What in the actual F did I just watch. 💀 This series was so out of my wheelhouse but I liked it and stuck with it. I had no idea what to expect and that ending was something I never would have guessed, lol!

For the record, I don’t think there is some big White conspiracy. He has no back story because he only existed to add to Tee’s story. He was young and flirty and Tee obviously had a jealous streak so maybe that’s what his hallucinations were about, that Tee thought he cheated even though he didn’t. But it all just existed so Tee could kill the person he loved most.

Crazy!

Copper is beautiful and I’m sad we won’t be seeing his face anymore. GL to him in England. I bet they all had so much fun making this!

Who else yelled "What the fuck?" out loud when the final credits came on the screen?

I expected Phee & Jin to make it, Tee was a surprise though that I don't understand.

But...White! Why poor White??????

ETA: So maybe none of them made it? I'm so confused, LOL.

Unpopular opinion-- I honestly like the end cuz I was thinking the same thing as Phee. Like their flash forward didn't make any sense, cuz like if they had they'd prolly all be in prison or something. But I also like the fact that we don't know for sure that the 3 we thought survived actually died, which means I can head canon Phee getting out alive and ending up (after years and years of therapy) being happy (even tho there is no way that that is what happens but let me be delulu ok). Idk I feel like it's also a good metaphor for trauma and guilt and all that. It is however the type of horror that scares me the most (not knowing if reality is real and all that) so I am now quite certain that I won't be able to sleep for a few days.

Overall I think it was an insanely well done series and the acting was amazing. Also I appreciate the constant trigger warning throughout basically the whole episode, it definitely needed it.

Edit: Also thinking about it, New basically got his happy ending. The last thing we saw him see was Non moving towards the light and being satisfied and grateful for New's revenge. New never planned to come out of this alive so this was his ideal ending. The more I think about the show the more I like the endings for each character. Except for White's ending (although it made sense for Tee's ending) but the whole White's fear being that Tee accusing him of cheating rly confused me, like I did think at one point that he was probably a sex worker but I feel like they should have developed that more if they wanted that to be canon. Oh well nothing can be perfect, so I'm satisfied with what we got.

I liked it, each characters fate felt right for me. I didn’t like the way it was told, bc it felt shoehorned in with Phee making a VERY quick assumption/exposition of their fate. But I’ll take it. (anybody else an absolute SUCKER for those “do you remember how we got here in the first place?” Or “how’d we get out of here?” questions that open up a whole Pandora’s box of psychological/thrilling questions for the characters? Just me then?)

This was barely a BL for me, so I never once pegged any romantic pair as making it out HEA or, idk, alive for that matter😂.

I also loved the ending. I don't think Phee got out, but you can head canon that he did. There was going to be no happy ending, and we all knew it (unless you were still trying to put this into the usual BL box). Even the 'end game' couple seemed like they were happy and then the rug was torn out from under them.

I wanna start this off saying that this is a THEORY for those that Want a Happy Ending. This is one of the ways that it could of happened. Only thing really holding this together is my BA in Psychology LOL. Sammon wanted this to be a Horror route. They even gave off how the ending of this show was going to go when they based their short film off of the Blair Witch Project which is a horror movie with a very ambiguous/open ended ending.

Trauma really does effect people in different ways.With Jin.. I could see him being just fine after all of that. His main thing is his obsession with people first non, and now Phee.. As long as Phee still agreed to be Jins he could get over/through anything -shrugs- nothing would/could phase him to much as long as he has Phee. Phee has basically become his Anchor to reality and stability.

Phee is a little harder.. He gets caught up in things quickly and becomes consumed it seems with what he gets caught up with that he seems to push all of his issues down to the back of his brain till he doesn't think about them anymore and then they start popping up out of no where -shrugs-. This is one way I can see the ending happening They got out but with Phee not having fully dealt with everything and keep suppressing it all at that time of the Lake it kind of all popped up and he got set off cause it was a spot that involved him and non heavily biggest thing with Phee i can see/tell is that he Suppresses almost anything/everything negative that happens to him/around him instead of dealing with it. Basically them at that lake triggered Phee with a hallucination relapse of everything he suppressed about that outing to stay functional.

Them not knowing how they got out or anything involving them leaving can be caused by the hallucinogen. You can have a short term amnesia/memory lose after how huge of a dose/antidote they took back n forth combating all of it. And with Por's parents.. Really the dad only cared about his image they'd easily be able to cover all that shit up and just move on LOL.

Another way to view this (I am not claiming credit for this. This is from someone, not naming them unless they want to be known, who added a theory onto what I just wrote.)

"Also, if they really *are* stuck in the cabin but they're in a delusion where they're happy and together...thats not so bad? Like even seeing Non drown himself occasionally was more shocking than devastating. Either way it could be worse. They either left and are OK or they're stuck but happy together. "


Adding onto what they wrote.. I could see Phee having those delusions for the rest of his life with how much of the chemical/hallucinogen he ended up inhaling both during the cabin and as New and him were working on it. It could of became something that will just always happen on and off. His face along with Jin's weren't shocked that he started walking towards the water, n Phee seeing non was more just startled

Both of these theories are perfectly plausible in this universe. Before the question as to whether or not they left the house at the end. In my mind, Phee was just having normal hallucinations no biggie he can live with that 😂

And the 2nd theory is pretty much like Love for Love's Sake. I completely and wholeheartedly believe they are in that alt universe HAPPY.

EDIT: I see a lot of comments and people saying it's a cliffhanger, or will there be a season 2 - it's actually NOT a cliffhanger. Phee and Jin didn't get to live a 'normal' life.They never got out of that house. They have to live in purgatory forever (or the last moments of their lives). Phee had to watch Non drown himself. He's stuck there watching Non die over and over again, knowing that he couldn't save Non or Jin.


I'm in fucking AGONY. And I have to go to work after this! I knew that we could never get a happy ending, but not like this. Not like this. I saw so many vaguetweets about how people hated what people were doing and that the end sucked, but I think it ended perfectly for what it was. We even got that the 'end game' romance of any other BL was them stuck in purgatory forever. Everything was so very poetic justice and perfect revenge horror. A+++++++++

- New was never coming out of this alive. This was always an extended suicide for him. He's no longer New - he's full Jonathan Crane. That opening shot of him dancing with the gas could fit straight into a Batman comic. Even if Phee hadn't shot him, how was he supposed to go back to regular society after this? He was on the path of no return. He'd killed two innocent people (when it had the flashes of Deng and White, I was just overcome with a swell of emotion). He gets to be with his family again. He got what he wanted. Revenge. At the cost of EVERYTHING.

- Jesus Fucking Christ, Tee. Again, I knew that there wouldn't be a happy ending, but not like this... All his actions led to this moment. He ruined Non's life, even if he didn't 'mean' to. Just like he finally found happiness, but he still destroyed it with his own hands, even if he didn't mean to. JJay fucking KILLED it. I really want to see him in more stuff POST HASTE. I felt my stomach roiling when it had the cuts between Tee and White's hallucinations because of the mounting dread of the tragedy we were barrelling towards.

- Fluke losing his eyes that he used to see anything, but didn't do anything against.

- Top in the circle of judgement of his friends, how they were just looking at him like he was some moron.

- Jin stabbing and stabbing his fapping hand, for a lack of better term. That was the hand he used to film Non and Keng. That was the hand he used to masturbate to Non in the flashes we saw. He wanted Non for himself, and his jealousy led him to the video.

- Phee stuck in purgatory/hell, watching Non die over and over again because while he tried to find out the truth, he was never able to find Non and save him, and he wound up getting to comfortable in a life that was a lie. He got too comfortable with Jin, and now he's trapped there with him forever (or the last moments they are alive that are stretched out to an eternity psychically).


EDIT 2: There is a chance that Tee, Phee, and Jin survived, but they wouldn't be 'normal'. Por's dad, or one of their men, would eventually come to the house to find them after not hearing anything for a while, and find the scene. Tee would still be in the throes of mania like we saw in his bedroom in the fake future. Phee is stuck in a loop of seeing Non die over and over again, and Jin COULD be alive, but if he's still stabbing himself, would probably die of blood loss. Even if they DID survive, Por's dad would make sure they went to prison. So, even if they do survive, there is no happiness here.

Fluke's end was truly poetic justice, he witnessed the two key moments that sealed Non's fate but he preferred to ignore them even though deep down he knew of the consequences of "neutrality." 

from New/Tan I loved that while the others were tormented by Non he found peace and he was able to reconcile in his own way with his brother and receive his gratitude, for a moment I feared that they decided to make Non's ghost reproach him for his revenge and New died regretful.

I think the ending is just intended to be ambiguous so that viewers can take what they want from it. If a viewer wants to believe that the boys escaped but Non will always be haunting them and Tee is miserable, then they can. If a viewer wants to believe they all died there, they can. If a viewer wants to believe they're still hallucinating but could escape, they can.

Though I will say, I don't know that Phee and Jin would go to prison, because they didn't actually do anything. But again that's up to interpretation which I love about this ending, people can make of it what they want.

The crime scene is such a mess and everyone was high out of their minds that a prosecutor could easily get charges dropped or lessened. They would probably get charged with a lesser crime like assault but I think a murder charge would be hard to prove in a court of law in this case

I wonder if the cameras they hid are still recording, since the original purpose was to have proof of the confession they wanted to obtain.

I immediately came here when I finished it… QUESTION: Is there a season 2 planned or something? Or like a special episode? Cause that’s the feels I got…. I’m 🤷‍♀️

Otherwise: I liked it!! I didn’t ❤️ it, but I wanted some bloody carnage, and I got! Nobody got a happy ending, which I’m fine with.

Don’t come for me with this one, but I didn’t feel a thing when White died……..I just got detached from his character when we launched into the flashbacks. It sucks though cause I loved him and Fluke episode1-4. The separation didn’t make my heart grow fonder unfortunately. Sorry.

My eyes were rolling big time in the last 10mins (in fact, I was yelling DON’T DO THIS SHOW), but I’m glad they flipped it. It was shoehorned for sure, but I wasn’t going to be ok with Phee/Jin living happily ever after, while Tee’s suffering/gone fruit loops. Phee will forever hallucinate about Non (as he should, I ❤️him, but it’s right for his character), and they’re ALL forever stuck there, either living or dead. It feels right to me, ya know? Plus, they ask the ultimate question imho: Who suffers/suffered more? The living or the dead? I’d rather die personally.

New’s ending was the best/worst for me. Mio rocked everything like a frickin boss, and you could tell he was having a good time. A big part of me wanted him to have his vengeance, but I knew he (and Non, his parents) was going to be a tragic figure in all this. 💔😔

He's leaving at the end of the year, right? There's still time to squeeze in something. But I doubt it will be S2 or a special episode. I kinda dig that Sammon went all the way horror here. No need of HEA. How could there after that bloodbath??? Those who remain might need therapy for life.

AHHHHHHHHHHH.

We will finally know which theories are correct. Me and my friend keep thinking that it's going to end just like the short movie ended - with Jin being the only one left. It looks like we're going to go right into the plot of the short film in this episode where each person sees the masked figure, but the figure is different for each of them, which is true because they are all hallucinating something different.

I really liked that ending, especially the way what we learned about everybody throughout the past few episodes (starting ep 5 really) came to really haunt them in their last moments. Like I love that Fluke, who was constantly witnessing things (Top breaking the camera, Jin taking the video) but never speaking up about them gouged his own eyes out. Loved Tan's visions as well; to him, he was finally a good phi who took care of his nong. I was expecting Tee to die but the fact that he killed White omg my mouth was agape that whole sequence

The very very end was... I'm choosing to believe this was just like 2 minutes after the massacre, not 2 years, and they're all currently dying in that courtyard and Phee's hallucinating still (just an extension of seeing Non die in a million ways and he doesn't necessarily even have to have the drug to hallucinate, it could be just from the trauma of everything going on).

Id say that everyone we saw from the outside perspective (the scene where they pan around the room) is confirmed dead (so yes) while anything that focused on one character's perspective (like the flash forward) is up in the air on whether it was reality or not.

That's just my interpretation based on like cinematography story telling stuff I've learned about tho :/

It seems some people were confused by the ending. The twist is that nobody actually made it out of the house. Phee and Jin were hallucinating. Maybe they eventually escaped but we’ll never know.

Overall, I really enjoyed the series but the ending was a misstep for me. I initially wanted to like Phee x Jin but the confession scene where Phee admitted to being Non's boyfriend and Jin admitted to filming the video of Non and Keng was so anticlimactic with neither character particularly having a strong reaction to that news and it having not much effect on their relationship. 

In the end I was hoping Non would somehow be alive, maybe due to interference by Perth's character. Nope, Perth's character didn't really have a purpose to the narrative after all. I was also hoping Tee would attempt to redeem himself by either killing his uncle or sacrificing himself to protect White. White was really the only character I particularly wanted to make it out alive but I would have been okay with a few others living depending on the circumstances.

The everybody dies ending would also have been fine but I hated the fake out two years later bit that tonally clashed with the rest of the episode. I definitely didn't want Phee and Jin to end up happily ever after, so I'm glad that wasn't real but the reveal was just kinda dumb. Sammon loves her last minute audience manipulation (Tan and Bun shooting eachother and falling off a cliff in MOD, Triage pretending like it's going to have a sad ending until the last possible minute leaving barely any time for the audience to enjoy the main couple being together) and it never quite works for me.

This finale was terrible. I don't mean bad...I mean this definition; "extremely unpleasant". They brought the horror angle full circle and it's not my bag of chips, but gd if they did not do an amazing job with this show. I like Sammon's scripts and I became a fan of more than one of these actors.

All that being said...

WHAT THE FLUCKING FLUCK WAS THAT ENDING?!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?

I’m so sad poor innocent White got dragged into this and ultimately lost his life at the hands of his lover 😔 rip white. I feel that ending left doors open for a possible second season but with the news that Copper is going abroad a second season wouldn’t be the same without him 😭 overall DFF is definitely one of my favourite BL shows! All the casting was perfect and the acting was superb 😍

Overall not a bad ending. I wanted all dead basically, well beside White which is sad and the most shocking scene for me!

For all those Jin supporters out there that forgave Jin for filming Non now you can get confirmation that Jin indeed posted that video.

New feeling guilty for that Uncle and White's death was a nice touch. Non was a good kid too once like White, he wasnr spare so why should White?

I really enjoyed this show, it was intriguing and thinking about different theories was fun!

I have to give them A+ for these kids acting!

It was a good finale! It felt like a cop out a little with how open ended it was but still a great experience overall, I had a lot of fun with it and the cast and crew have a lot to be proud of!

I like to believe they all died lol so New, baby, I'm proud of you, you did it. He's a little guilty for the innocent people dying which is fair but I'm so glad they didn't make him feel remorse about any of those other jerks. I wish he got a hug from Ghost Non! but I'll take the thank you.

White, sweetie, I'm so sorry, you deserved to be canon confirmed final girl. Sad that White wasn't on the fantasy revenge twink team of Perth and Non that I had envisioned in my head. He kind of just existed to be Tee's character growth manic pixie dream boy plot device alas. But Tee's subconscious drug state equating White with Non fed into my TeeNon ghost ship so that was fun for me lol.

The way I was FURIOUS at the two year time skip and SEETHING as Jin was like thanks for forgiving me let's move on :) like BRO lmao Jin's guilt is so minimal compared to everyone else's even though he's argueably caused Non the worst trauma of all of them minus Tee. Fluke stabbed his own eyes out just because he was a passive observer, all Jin did was stab his hand and then live happily ever after and decide things are fine now??? I was so mad lol then the last few lines happened and I was like ok ok I can live with this.

They really wrote themselves into the wall with Jin. PheeJin is a massively unappealing ship imo and it's part because even until the end, Jin didn't take stock of his sins the way the other characters were forced to do. Even his sex tape hallucination felt centered on himself not Non and his hand stabbing was nothing compared to what all the other people in the friendgroup inflicted on themselves so his comeuppance was wholly unsatisfying until the very end for me. Plus he still got "the guy" in his dead person ghost hallucination/fantasy high so it was very vomit emoji for me. The writers should have never confirmed that Jin was the one who posted the sex tape if they wanted the audience to root for him/like him. And then if they didn't want the audience to root for him/like him, they should have committed to showcasing his narrative punishment further than they did because it really felt neutered/flat compared to everyone else..

I'm choosing to believe they're all dead except White who somehow hobbled out idk. I'm gonna miss a lot of these actors so I'm eager for more from them! And I also appreciate BOC taking on a risky standard defying genre of BL though I still wish they committed to the journey a lil more than they did. Great show, I enjoyed so much of it and I'll probably give it an 8.5 maybe a 9 on MDL.

oh also MAJOR shoutout to Barcode, he impressed me so so much in this role and especially this ep! He's MVP of this show and then probably JJay for me, another great performance.

I loved this finale. This show started episode one by paying homage to slashers and ended in true slasher fashion.

In the end, Non got his revenge. At least the revenge the audience and New wanted to see.

As a horror fan i absolutely loved the ending...but I'm confused as to whether Tee guy is alive... But he became mentally unstable abnormal after that traumatizing event... But all the others died 100℅ .. I loved it still i needed closure for Non did he die of suicide or illness... I don't know i fast forwarded through the ep.. But still did not Find more about him... Anyways kudos to the writers i loved it absolutely ❤

Y'all I waited until tonight to watch both eps 11 & 12 bc I didn't want any cliffhanger but like wtf just happened in ep 12??

Where did the plot go? Why did poor bb White have to die instead of Tee, he didn't even KNOW Non. 😭

Did they ALL die? What was that ending scene even? What happened to Keng? How did Non actually die and when did Tee's uncle get exposed? What about Tee's sick dad?

I'm so damn confused and that was just it? Not a satisfying ending at all. 😭 😭

Think it's cause the last scene cut off too abruptly, and as someone who hates open ended and vague things with a burning passion I get them, but I'm not as annoyed this time cause I expected something like this considering there was one episode left and so much to cover. I just convinced myself that the ending meant they all died, or at least Jin and Phee didn't get the happy ending they absolutely didn't deserve and are either dead or in a mental institute having hallucinations for the rest of their miserable lives

Cause of death: The Heart Killers ❤️‍🔥🔪
Woah. Props to Sammon for sticking to the premise and not bending to the BL rules. This ended as it should: with lots of gore, deaths and NO HEA. We can delulu ourselves but we are stuck in that valley house. FOREVER.

When I checked the running time, I knew we were not having happy.

So a couple fo things I need to discuss:

Did White cheat on Tee during those 2 years? I think so. He wouldn't be hallucinating venereal diseases's boils if he hadn't. Did he cheat on Tee with Phee?? Mmm... That's more tricky but it felt like they were hinting that, right?

Was Jin another victim of Keng? I think the theories about this are true. He was double pissed when he found out about Non and Keng. I don't think a crush on Non deserved that reaction but watching your "ex-lover" having sex with your current crush might be it.

Did Jin post the video then? I was finally on Team Jin didn't do it because of the light and dark mode of the computers but then it seemed they doubled down on Jin being the culprit and that was it. This felt not satisfying to me.

I'm salty about White. He really was an innocent bystander and wasn't meant to survive. Now Tee's outcome... The best revenge, NGL.

I don't think Jin was a victim of Keng. I think that was just part of seeing himself as being filmed, and thus he was put in Non's position. I think that the fact that we saw how much Jin masturbated thinking of Non that he really was jealous and hurt because he'd built up such a fantasy of Non that he did post the video as pure reaction.

Tee's outcome is the coldest revenge dish ever. JJay did so fucking well that I am RUINED.

The light and dark mode were misleading!!!! I hadn't even noticed at first and then I went down the Tumblr rabbit hole and they convinced me. I see your point about Jin and Keng. I still believe he went just a tad bit overboard with his reaction but that also explains this kid had these friends for a reason too.

I can answer 3. Jin def posted the video. We see the uploading bar go up to 100% with his mouse hovering over the tweet/publish button. Then he throws his beer and his computer sends out sparks so we can only really guess if the computer going out like it did made the confirm click (that can happen.) or just straight up died. But then we get to the school and the look on jin's face when the other kids are watching then looking at them.. Plus the way he shuts down fluke when he tries to speak about it hints heavily that it def happened through his tweet x.x.

Gonna throw out my own ideas for the other questions ^^.

White def cheated on Tee, OR... he was a prostitute during those 2 years.. I can't really think of any other way for his fear of STDs to be the biggest thing he fears over all others x.x Tho him cheating with Phee ? I can't see that one =/... My take of Phee is that he just got to comfy with Jin and ended up falling in love with Jin while doing this long con. I can't see myself Phee sleeping with White during all of this.

On Jin.. I think his love of Non was more of a complete obsession with him. so when he say something he thinks he owns/is his sleeping with someone else he kinda lost it. Honestly all these damn kids seems to have some mental instability.

Yeah, Jin was totally obsessed with Non. The way he jerked off to him constantly. And look at the way that he was completely besotted with Phee INSTANTLY. Jin's a character that latches onto boys. So, when he saw Non with Keng, he got super jealous, like Non was cheating on him (because when you're obsessed with someone, you have scenarios in your head that aren't even real).

Hi I haven’t been on air in a minute but wow. My jaw is on the floor. I am baffled, perplexed, content, sad, apathetic, angry, etc etc. With all that happened, this outcome makes the most sense. I like that there’s no neat and tidy end because that wasn’t the show. It was messy and messed with your mind and the truth was always out of reach. I think White was the only shrapnel here. But even then, the boils must have meant something more than we know. This was my first 10/10 show on MDL. JJ needs his own series immediately, he has so much potential and carried so well! Just wow… this one is gonna stick with me.

I just now wonder who is the person lightning the cigarets in the end. Like was all that phee had started to see just hallucination to the very end or really tan died and after that he fall again to háve vision of non. I doubt that Tan scene with non would be just hallucination because it was very emotionál to viewers. So who was it Tan, non, phee or just a director hint that the cigarets phee smoked one after another were not a actuall antidox but just different drugs which trap him there ?

Edit :

Like.. If they stopped it right there the ending would of been kinda good. It'd of closed things out. We'd of known what happened to phree, jin, and tee the 3 we think survived... but then they just had to add that bullshit at the end and ruin it V.V... MAN!!!!

The ending is perfect. They didn't leave the house. There was no normal life. Phee didn't get to escape seeing Non die over and over again. They all died. New got his revenge for Non. Tee may be still alive, but he's so broken, that he's exactly as we saw him, just on the floor of that house instead of in his actual room. Phee and Jin are trapped in the hell they made.

Cause of death: The Heart Killers ❤️‍🔥🔪
Can't relate. Two years was just too little time for Phee and Jin to bounce back up after what they went through. Especially Jin. I was kinda expecting to see his hand at some point, he wen't HARD stabbing it with the scissors but there was nothing. That seemed sus to me. NGL, the 2 years after was misleading and was unnecessary of they were gonna bring us back to square 1, or in this case, the freaking valley house.

ok, so here after watching ep 12, all I can say is that the series has successfully come out wid the most unique way of ending it and none of the theories made so far are correct... or are they ?
I don't wanna spoil, I want everyone to watch and leave their thoughts abt the ending.
Edit: I think the ending hints towards everyone eventually being dead inside of that house, but if u think abt it another way, it culd also be a possibility that none of this is actually happening, since the beginning of the show everyone was drugged and there's a high possibility that they r all stuck wid what has been happening in their hallucinations, the only part we can actually confirm is true is the fact that these grp of boys have hurt non (in some way or other every single one of them has, except white) we will never know which part was real and which ones are hallucinations because they've been drugged since the beginning of ep 1, imo the show is a cluster of everyone's hallucinations which eventually leads us to the story of non.

Ummm sooo my life is in shambles and I’m absolutely flabbergasted that they killed off the oNE INNOCENT LITTLE BOY HHHHHHHHH

Idek how to feel about the ending, I would hope we get something more to feel more complete about the ending cause wtf. I also wish that phee and jin would’ve ended up together together cause they were perfect for each other.

I’m so surprised that just about everyone died, if this is traditional horror, I must not watch enough LMAO.

Anyway, this show was amazing, if my emotions are this affected by it then it was definitely an amazing show. 14/10

That ending left me speechless, I'm so satisfied and dissatisfied at the same time, I loved what happened with Top and Fluke, Jin got off lightly, poor white tho:( i think we really needed one more episode for all of it to wrap up, I still have so many questions  Btw, did anyone notice how at New's last moments when he hallucinated Non, Non was wearing his red bracelet? Was that a mistake on their part? Wasn't the last time they talked that scene outside their house? I went back and checked and Non didn't have his bracelet then, I'm not even sure he was talking to Phee at that time, so why would New hallucinate that bracelet? I'm kinda obsessed with that thing cause Non had it even when he died and that fact haunts me Aside from that I feel so bad for how Non died, thinking no one cared, being worked to death and beaten up and how even his body was just towed off

Finished everything in two days pheww what a ride. If you’re looking for typical BL then this was not it. It was a horror thriller series with gay characters.

I like the ending. You can interpret it however you want, it could be literally anything and there’s no way to confirm what was real or what was not. One of the most interesting theory was that all of them might really just still hallucinating. New clearly didn’t trust Phee so he might drugged Phee from the start as well. And he keeps on smoking that stuff around them so they just passed out and falls deep into their hallucinations, trapped inside their worst fears with no way out. Everything that happened after that was really just some sort of massive, layered, intertwined hallucinations and even if they got save there’s no way they could live normally. Personally I thought it was worst than death. Or everything happened exactly like New wanted it to be. He has nothing to lose after his parent’s death. So might as well go all out with the revenge. Poor Phee unknowingly got caught up in New’s revenge plot while all he wanted was to know the truth.

I’ve seen a lot of comments hating on Phee. Sure he was wrong for pushing Non but from his pov, he saw the video and this was after he confronting Non about his relationship with the teacher. Anyone would be pissed. He was hurting so he hurt Non with his words/actions. It was wrong yes, in the ideal world he would ask and wait for explanation but they were just some 17yo boys who’d didn’t think stuff through. He managed to calm down and willing to talk to Non albeit too late. There’s no way he could’ve known that this leads to Non’s breaking point, I mean Non did hide things from him. He even told him to ditch the group. Of course I’m in no way blaming Non. His family situation wasn’t exactly ideal and his so called friends (and his tutor) took advantage of him. He was thrown in this sh*tty situation thus he makes some questionable decisions. The whole situation was sad really.

Everyone had their shares leading Non to his ending especially his group of so called friends. If anything I was dissatisfied with the lack of Phee’s reaction to Jin’s confession like?? Shouldn’t he’d be more idk angry?? disappointed? Not to mentioned he really hallucinated about being together with Jin after all that bruhhh 💀 but I guess it kinda shows that he really just wanted some closure about Non and moved on with his life. Jin pretending to be morally upright (compared to his friends) pissed me off when in reality he is just like them. And he showed lack of remorse too.

If you think about it, New was so determined to end it all he probably didn’t bring the antidote let alone his inhaler. He also might lied to Phee. So while Phee gained conscious he might inhaled more of the drug thinking it was the antidote. So from that point onwards there’s no way to know which was real. Did he passed out? Did he shoot New? Did he managed to save Jin and Tee? But even if he did, he unknowingly drug them again. So the hallucinations continues. All we know from the ending he actually realized that everything was in his head (he seems to have high tolerance towards the drugs) so he is most definitely alive and was still at the house. And there also the sound of the lighter and someone’s smoking so I’m assuming that was New probably high from the drugs. I’d love to have more conclusive ending but can’t say I don’t like this ending. It has this eerie, unsettling vibe which match the series.

I was actually surprised with the explicit sexual scene, it was hot but unnecessary I think? Also it was super triggering so please watch with caution. I thought Shadow was hard enough but this series was even more.

Overall while it was not perfect but as a horror triller fan I thought it was pretty good. I would also like to applaud Barcode because he nailed his role especially when he goes all psychotic, chills. I always thought he was one of the weakest actors in KPTS but he improved a lot here. Appreciate BOC for producing this kind of series, I hope we can get more of this.

Um, thank you. Phee still remained my favorite even when I was disappointed (the “friends” comments he made in epi 10, 12 IRKED me) with him, but I didn’t have the patience to type it.

I still feel he’s the one character I could justify/defend the easiest of the “bad guys.”

I just finished watching DFF just now and I was just crying the whole episode... The ending was really unique.. I just felt like my heart just shattered like the actors all did a great job in making me cry. I am sorry to White I thought he was involved with Non but no he was innocent, but it makes sense his name literally symbolises purity. But anyways I am still in tears because of how Tan or New didn't deserve to die like that. The cigarret that had an X on it that Tan said that had the extracts was the actually the one that didn't have the X on it. Tan lied to Phee about that fact which explains why him, Jin and Tee are still stuck at the house.

The flashbacks at 31mins just before the time skip was soul-crushing. Very aptly soundtracked by Jon Björk - Before It's Gone. 🥹

As a horror fan i love it... Loved the ending... Barcode really nailed his role his evilish smile was spooky and i loved it... All the gore blood was perfect... It had an open ending too... And i also heard there will be special episode i hope its not behind the scenes but more about non/white/new perspective.... I might sound crazy but New really is a kind brother i wish i had a brother like him🤡❤....

So the ending was gory and I think the best outcome that nobody got an happy end.

But in the end the story did not feel that strong.

I get the sense that they already started filming while the ending was not clear yet and leaving it open if there was a 9th person there and if that was Non. There are still a lot of plotholes unclear.

New/Tan btw was amazing his performance and even the end hallucination were done great. Up until the end he was convinced what he did was right. And no torturing and killing is never ok as it also included innocent bystanders.

White sole purpose of being the liberation for Tee and then becoming is own personal hell was so good.

But Jin I had so much hope for this character. It does feel like they did not known what to do with him. They should have made him darker, and have that at least be known to Phee. Him filming and posting Non seemed like an actual of impuls based on revenge and hurt. Which afterwards he felt guilty about. This suggest specially his age and the rest of his behavior as more of a really stupid act then him being super bad. So why would his hallucination be about him being filmed, specially they way they did it. To me that did not make sense. And then he starts stabbing his own hand? Why what was the link with his hallucinations. If he was going to stab something I would have chosen another body part.

Oh and if his biggest fear is for his sex acts to be caught on camera, why have sex in front of your window or give a bj on a balcony in a house that you know had cameras??

I went in nearly blind. Didn’t expect any BL because the horror/ thriller elements were advertised to me the most. I loved it all the way through.

I was consistently excited for the next episodes and mind fucked by the ending. I’m sad I finished it so quickly.

the ending reminded me of the movie "Incident in the ghostland" where 2 sisters are trapped and tortured for many years and one sister dreams of getting out and having this whole new life as an successful author for 16 years while still being trapped in the house and the sister brings her back to reality and they escape the house. if thats the route they are taking then we can expect a season 2 soon where they they try to escape the house.

I’m extremely late, but I dropped DFF around halfway through Ep 4 as it was airing. I’m glad I picked it up again because the flashback episodes were amazing and really caught my interest. Aside from Phee and White, I was pretty ok with everyone else dying though.
