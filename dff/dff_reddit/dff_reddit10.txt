i love Ta and Jin and Fluke, but I was just rooting for Tan the entire episode. lol I can see everything from everyone's side and put myself in everyone's shoes - I can even see things from Top's pov! His uncle is a criminal, he's poor, like, what is he supposed to do? Realistically. I honestly don't even hate anyone in this cast or see anyone as a "villain" (tho, JJ's tutor Keng was fucking YIKIES af) even tho they're murderers and bullies. But Tan has my sword absolutely right now. I was lowkey giddy when everything at the cabin was chaos and he was trying very hard not to smile fully in satisfaction. My smart bb. 😩 lmao!

Well I’m not sure how I feel after today’s episode, we have 5 episodes left and today was the big reveal already… Jin got off way too lightly for the confession.

I’m going to try and remain positive that they will stick the landing, and we still haven’t solved the mystery of what happened to Non so that is still a big question mark.

I’m leaning into White having an agenda as well AND he’s going to be the one to get out of this.

Only one warning 29:00min ‼️ shooting

BUMP, THE ACTOR THAT YOU ARE!!! I'm in awe guys! Like we've been steadily growing this hostility towards his character but boy is he doing the most. Fear, paranoia, hatred, fury... he portrayed every aspect in an excellent way and I. AM. IMPRESSED. He stole this episode. There's no two ways about it. Am I happy that Top seems to be out? Well happy is a strong word, but I won't be missing him. Tan is finally getting some answers but I don't think he's gonna like them. My heart broke with White's when he learned about Tee's involvement in Non's disappearance. I still believe there's more to White and that preview is giving me hope. Also giving us hope for Non's whereabouts, the previews.

One thing for sure, I'm making peace with the fact that this series won't have a happy ending. Whatever happens, the characters that survive are gonna need years of therapy. I hope u/ThoughtsAllDay is planning accordingly.

This time i will just say that I am sure we are being bamboozled.

Things don’t fit. The narrators are either lying or unreliable.

The computers don’t match.

Phee knows things he is not supposed to.

Phee says he is still Non’s boyfriend.

Jin still sees a bloody Keng as a fear for no damn reasons.

Tan was on the couch with Fluke and Top when Por was empaled, he cannot have raised the branch last minute.

And we know from the preview that Tee is absolutely lying about Non.

There IS a ninth person.

We are being cleverly bamboozled, we think we know because the characters admitted, and we don’t, and only the next two episodes will properly shed light on everything.

Edit : just to precise that I am loving every second of it and Tee was my favourite this episode.

I hope you’re right, I really do. I’m not gonna shut any of these down (why would I?) My hope against hope is they throw us off completely and pull off an ending so surprising and unexpected.

My fear is that none of this could be a red herring, manipulation. Everything is face value, it is what we showed you. The writers lost their steam rounding 3rd base, they don’t stick the landing (yay sports metaphors!), they don’t catch me off guard, and it goes exactly as anticipated

So after the show is over, I’ll look back at it as a show that I spent way too much time on. Its potential was never full reached for me, and it’s yet another Thai BL that flubbed up its own ending.

This is my ultimate fear for this show.

This is my ultimate fear for this show.

wait, you need to be "surprised" by the ending for it to be good? What? lol

i think if everything ends with everything we've been shown being face value, that's amazing and sticking the landing. 💯 The writing on this show so far has been great with so much obvious attention to detail, character nuance, and intention. And I love that. I think everything being what we've been shown at the end of the day would be a brilliant ending. I love stunts and gags, but M. Night Shyamalan twists just to gag the girls can be so tired.

like, just have a pov and tell the story you want to tell the way you want to tell it and I'll be down to clown if it's interesting and done well, and I think what DFF has done so far has been amazing. It reminds me of peeps that were "disappointed" with Only Friends and most of all Mew, because he wasn't diabolical like everyone imagined. lol

I have a hard time believing that knowing the team of author on the show.

The dedication to keeping the show and part of the cast under wraps.

And the attention to details until now.

But I am a glass half full king of person so we will see. But all signs points to us getting deliciously bamboozled, and since we already were before (I mean episodes 1-4 were lacklustre until we had the flashback and then everything suddenly clicked marvellously) I am confident it will be so again.

I can understand Phee falling in love but acting like it was nothing when Jin confessed he upload the video? Dude WTF. And WTF about wanting to help "our friends". You had to stop Non from killing himself thanks to "these friends".

Glad at least Tan got his objetive and finally Tee is talking. I hope that knowing what happened Jin and Phee regretted what they did and start the crying.

Fluke has been awesome here, I know he did what he did because the drugs but it was time to tell Tee he is a bastard and rotten.

White realizing the real colours of his boyfriend is heartbreaking but it was necessary.

Por and Top who were two who most hurt Non are out. Now it's your time Tee.

I also was like hmmm.. that was a mild response. When Phee was like we both messed up, I definitely was like yeah but in VERY different ways and then there was no discussion about the video and the fact that Jin liked Non as well AND what have they are to each other now with the new details. Like I would be cracking skulls if someone did some revenge po*n stuff like that to my boyfriend. I know they were young but come on…

Phee, you spineless loser, there is no way that hole is so good that you can instantly be that chill and sprung for Jin after finding out this is the guy who filmed and then circulated one of the most horrifying parts of your bf's trauma!!! I know that this is a BL at the end of the day so they want to give the fans some "cute" romance but damn, what a let down. There was all that build up of Jin's Nice Guy sins just for a glossed over admission and a very repetitive and unnecessary going-in-circles scene and some pandering romantic words set to sentimental music. And then Jin had the nerve to yell at Tee while Jin literally just stood there watching all this shit go down and no one calls him out on it! The lowest point in the ep for me, for sure. I understand if Phee thinks his yelling at Non to go die is just as bad as Jin posting his unrequited crush's dubcon sextape to the internet but there's no way that the writers think that, right? right??? lol I really hope the narrative punishes Jin still even if Phee won't.

New, they can never make me hate you. Any time the camera panned to his smiling at the pain he was causing, I laughed too. Fuck those guys.

Tee, give me hope for redemption. He even had zuko makeup! lol. Now this is the soul crushing guilt I expected to see from Jin but never got. Idk if it's the superior acting or writing or direction or just because the actor is tall so I got blinders on, but I'm rooting for him to survive somehow. Hopefully next ep we can see how he put his money where his mouth is and actually helped Non. And if not, rip to this hottie.

Fluke, mvp. Got rid of annoying ass Top, got Tee to confess and move this plot forward, gave us more cute whimpering White. He was so good, he carried the ep for me. I also love that the show is treating Fluke's doing nothing as he witnessed this bullying as just as bad as all the bullying that happened.

Ultimately, I am trying to temper my expectations bc this is a BL but I'm still really hoping the narrative follows through on a satisfying ending. If PheeJin just walk off into the sunset holding hands no harm no foul then I'm going to hunt them down with an axe myself lol.

Excited for Perth and more Non and Tee focus next ep! Love this series I'm hype for more.

Something makes me think Fluke has definitely done more than we've seen. He's been exceedingly "passive" but his reactions go beyong the drive to get to be a doctor. And then there is White; he may be innocent in the initial aspect, but I still feel like he's a hidden factor (may have even met Non in what appears to be a brothel maybe; heard the story and be there as another figure to help disrupt the group)

idk if I agree about Fluke, I think his character exists as the friend who did nothing while this boy was bullied so terribly and that's enough for the guilt to eat away at him and cause these excessive reactions. I hope you're right about White!

OMG I had the same feeling about Jin. Oh yes so I filmed Non and posted it online and ruined Nons life and his family reputation but oh well things happen!

Jin had lots of attitude talking to Phee and New! And I'm sorry the only thing Jin does is talking and no action!

I really hope they don't feed us with a PheeJin ending couple cause I will be forever mad!

Jin's attempt at "action" is so surface level which I actually loved about him! I LIKED that all he did was go 'guys that's not cool :/' a couple times then continued to pull Non into his friends' shitty web. He knew how terribly Non was being treated and continued to tempt and encourage him to hang out with them repeatedly just because he was selfish and sprung and wanted Non for himself. I liked that he was vengeful and bitter and awful when Non was being preyed upon by the teacher. And then this guy STAYS friends with these assholes for three more years! Genuinely enjoyed all these character driven bad choices because I thought the story would give him his comeuppance and it mirrored Fluke's similar stood-there-and-watched story.

But now with Phee getting lost in the sauce and openly doting on him and how everyone seems to express their guilt and remorse way more intensely than Jin did in his one scene of admitting his sins, I am losing hope that Jin is going to get what he deserves. I want to trust the writers but idk. It's a shame because Jin's character would be way more interesting without the main ship plot armor.

I agree with everything you said. I live Jin and Fluke basically mirroring each other. But Fluke is aware of his inactions and Jin belive he is the good guy and did nothing wrong. I would have loved it if Jin till the end stayed delusional about his level of involvement, but I can't shake the feeling that they are gonna make Pheejin the endgame.

This is kind of how I feel about him too. In the flashback scenes, Jin gave me the feeling of a spider drawing Non into an inescapable web. Despite having feelings for Non, he not only failed to protect him from his toxic friend group but encouraged him and dragged him into their schemes. A huge difference from My Personal Weatherman where the two leads met under similar circumstances - Yoh was a social outcast who was seen as a creep for staring at people and drawing pictures of them. Mizuki deliberately walked away from his friends who’d been gossiping about him to befriend Yoh directly , which is what Jin should have done if he cared about Non’s well-being. His veneer of niceness is like a paper-thin balm over their rot, making him as culpable as the rest of them even if his intentions weren’t malicious. In a way he reminds me of a siren, luring Non with promises of friendship, acceptance, and belonging to satisfy his own selfish wants. As sirens in the myths tempted sailors with their deepest desires, he tempts Non with his desire to be part of an inner circle rather than an outsider. But he doesn’t back up those promises, leading Non into ruin.

While there might be cultural differences between Thailand and the countries where international audiences reside regarding the laws and perception around distributing child pornography, filming underage revenge porn with the intent to circulate it on the Internet is a serious offense. The devastating impact of revenge porn and sextortion scams have caused many teenagers and even grown adults to take their own lives. When he filmed and uploaded the video to a server, he was thinking only of himself and his own feelings of pain, heartbreak, and betrayal. Considering how it’s been handled in this show and his role in an established BL pair, I don’t think Jin will face any narrative payback for his actions, but I think it highlights his character as someone who finds it easier to be nice than to be kind. Unlike Fluke’s silent complicity, he has a conscience and the instinct to do what’s right, but he consistently retreats into maintaining the status quo. He is essentially a coward, and says as much in episode 1 when Phee accuses him of running away from his problems. In episode 8, Fluke pointedly asks Jin as Non is being taken away, “Are you going to stop him?” In that moment he’s being asked if he can rise to the occasion, which he doesn’t. I hope in the final two episodes he’ll stand up for somebody for real instead of just asking his friends not to call Non mean names. I agree that without the inevitable BL happy ending he’d be a much more interesting character.

ugh love how you described the state of things, it's so true. I haven't watched MPW yet but heavy yes - if Jin really felt bad, he would have dropped those friends! dude stuck with them for years even after they bullied the shit out of Non!

I do hope Jin is able to rise the occasion I just don't see right now how that would absolve him of uploading non con porn lol. I have am trying to remain hopeful though!

Does anybody see some similarities between Tan/New and Hamlet? They’re both haunted by ghosts real or imagined, burdened by grief, and driven to seek revenge for the death of a family member. But rather than killing their targets directly, they plan to extract a confession by orchestrating an elaborate play-within-a-play. Tan/New's decision to hide his return from England from his parents and shoulder his burdens by himself mirrors Non's decision to hide his massive debt from Phee and Hamlet’s decision to feign madness alone - this isolation inadvertently leads to the deaths of their loved ones, compounding their grief and trauma. He seems to be teetering on the edge of sanity and the willingness to live, reminiscent of Hamlet's struggle with suicidal thoughts and mental instability. We don’t know if he’s actually committed murder yet, but if his reaction to Top being shot is any indication he doesn’t care about collateral damage. Can New become the person he once was, or is he doomed to die as Tan? Ultimately Hamlet ends in a bloodbath, emphasizing the cyclical nature of revenge and violence. With two sons dead, a family torn apart, and Por’s family likely to seek retribution, it’s hard to imagine that the survivors’ lives would return to normal again. :/

Since the woods featured more prominently in this episode (and it does seems like there’s someone following Phee and Jin among those trees), I was also thinking if they serve as a means to seek justice for the marginalized in this show. If boxlike buildings and geometric structures represent societal institutions trapping and oppressing people at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid like Non and his family, then the uninhabited woods could offer a path to justice denied to them by the police or the courts. It might symbolize a space for the aggrieved and the wronged where the accumulation of material wealth has no power.

This episode was slow-paced and felt a bit like filler, but I guess it was a chance to pause and breathe after the revelations of the past couple episodes. Kudos to Bump and JJay for completely owning their scenes, especially considering they're rookie actors. Can't wait for the next episode to reveal White's backstory; we’ll find out if he’s going to be the final girl after all.

Honestly at this point no one can piss me off more than Jin! The way he talked to Phee before his confession and then talking to Tan! The attitude and entitlement!

He really doesn't feel guilty or anything about whatever he done to Non. It's all just lipservice and it doesn't matter. At least Fluke the forever bystander, is feeling a smidge in concise!

I really enjoyed Flukes acting this episode.

I feel like this episode painted Tan/New into such a one dimensional character and I'm not sure if I'm willing to believe it. I feel like they're trying to trick us and I honestly am more intrigued than ever before. Really pissed off at Phee but I feel like that's intentional as well. I will say though, I'm gonna be eternally pissed off if Phee/Jin are endgame 😅 That's all!

I’ll be disappointed too at this point, it doesn’t feel right to be endgame and happy. If a couple is to end up together, I’d prefer PheeNon, and they’re scheming together.

Bump and JJ really carried this episode, Bump the most. We’re getting the backstory and everything is being woven together. There is another time jump back but it was marked this time lol. Idk I don’t have as many thoughts this episode. There’s more answers finally but there’s still some big questions about Non’s whereabouts and what the endgame is.

In the preview we see more Perth and White and that’s exciting to see how they play into the mix. Phee wasn’t hard on Jin at all but idk maybe it’s cause they both have blame here. Getting to the end!

Anyways. White is up to sth as well, right?

Also, Non still alive? Huh? But to "get money"? 😭💔😱

Well, I figured that Phee wouldn't be part of the whole murdering part of the plan, but it's good to have confirmation that Tan/New did go rogue on his own.

Hmmm, I'm kinda of 2 minds about Phee spilling the beans to Jin and then forgiving so quickly when Jin confessed to being the one who posted the video. On the one hand, I feel like they should both be waaay more upset with each other. Phee lied about his motivations for joining their friend group and getting close to Jin for 3 fucking years, meanwhile Jin posted literal child pornography of Phee's first love which was the nail in the coffin for Non's entire life collapsing. Phee is complicit in the deaths that happen at that house, and Jin is complicit in Non's disappearance as well as Non's parents committing suicide. On the other hand, while it's inarguable here that Jin triggered a cascade with devastating consequences, mental health is not that cut-and-dry and they could have already been down that path with or without the video leaking, so it's not fair to blame one person for someone's suicide. And the gang uncle wanted to shut Non up well before the video leaked, so his disappearance was largely inevitable and the video just gave them a convenient coverup excuse. They've both also had 3 years to stew in their own shame and self-blame, so it is understandable how that might make them feel like blaming each other less.

Interesting how Tan/New tries to stoke a confession out of someone by bringing up how this is like Non's movie, but White is the one who brings up drugs and hallucination. I really gotta know what role he has to play in all of this. Maybe he's been a mole from the gambling gang the whole time, planted at Tee's side to make sure he doesn't betray them or try to dig into what happened to Non. Or my previous theory about him having gotten close to the gang to find out what happened to Keng bc he was also groomed and raped by him could still hold up.

Man, that rope on Top is so freaking loose and he's so crazed I'm surprised he hasn't just hulk-ripped out of it lol. Tho, I will say, as much as I hated Top as a character and Jet's scream-shout performance as him, this version where there's a chemically induced reason for him to act deranged is really well-done. I'm sorry for ragging on you earlier Jet, please play insanely unhinged characters more often bc I think that's your strong suit. However one last note: no one dies from a gut shot that quickly, you could have agonized a bit more instead of almost immediately collapsing. Tbf that could have been just how u were directed or they edited out a chunk of the dying process.

NGL, I was mad worried that Fluke would end up shooting Tee before he could finally confess. Goodriddance to Top. I've come around to the actor but the character is a garbage human who deserved to die.

Hold up, I thought Keng got hit by a car, he's still kickin? Hmmmm I wonder if the long-haired goon ended up having a soft spot for Non and letting him go, or maybe Non somehow escaped and he lied about it to the boss to cover his ass.

Tee, you lying idiot. What the fuck do you mean your uncle betrayed you and you didn't know what would happen to Non?? You threatened Non yourself with organ harvesting and death if he tried to rat out their money laundering scheme.

Oof, White looks genuinely heartbroken to find out the kind of person Tee really is.

Oooooh ok, from the preview maybe Tee really did try to help Non escape his uncle's clutches. Seems like he didn't go straight to organ harvesting....oh no, what if by "sell parts" they mean prostitution? Maybe Tee was setting up to try to buy Non's freedom, but his uncle decided it was too much of a risk and killed Non anyways? Fuuuuck, the horrors of Non's life really never end. Oooo but what if White actually met Non first while he was being held captive by the gang, and he decided to go on a similar revenge mission as Tan/New bc Non was his first love too. Ok, that actually wouldn't make much sense bc Non was cute but he couldn't have managed to get 3 seperate boys all falling for him at once, and would be silly writing to repeat Tan/New's motivation in a completely unrelated character. But a girl can dream, eh?

Pretty short ep. Not really filler, but definitely a break from the action and mystery to let the characters confess and breath. Which I think was needed as a sort of buffer between the buildup of eps 1-9 and the endgame of the last 2. We got a lot of necessary setup but it still maintained the tension, which is pretty impressive tbh. I wonder if we'll find out next ep for sure what Non's final fate is? I'm betting they'll save it for the finale.

Tbh, while I'm living for the subtlety in the characters for the most part, I kind of wish there was less nuance and they could just be mad at each other. I understand why time and guilt has tempered it, but I wanted to see them feel that rage and disgust at each other's wrong doings.

They could still be selling organs. Could be they sold Keng's organs first since he was already injured by the car. Considering the preview show Non bruised and injured, could be that the gang was in the middle of selling his organ part by part.

- So nobody else caught that someone else was marking the trees and them going in circles was probably on purpose??? Phee didn't have a very big reaction about that video confession. He's been fairly stoic, but he also 'dropped' the axe outside the house. And his 'explanation' of New setting the traps did not answer for the knife wounds on Por's arms as well as the impalement. Phee was leading Jin around on purpose, and his demeanor totally changed when he said "I will protect you". What if he was talking to Non and not Jin, and Non was out in the woods too, and they are in this together the whole time? There is still the Other Mask that was wearing the black shoes that attacked them in the graveyard.

- God JJay fucking killed it this episode. Tee's always been my fave character, and this just cemented it. He's so complicated. I *FELT* Tee's heart break when White's view of him changed. Whatever else he is, Tee loves White genuinely. When I rewatched Tee and White's sex scenes (for science....), after Tee looked at White, he had this DESPERATE look on his face. I also believe that he probably killed his Uncle.

- Fluke also is so fascinating. The bystander is now the only active murderer of the gang (that we know of - we only have Phee's word on the New stuff). Bitch, your hands are dirty - you ain't no bystander anymore.

- New's glee at Top's death was everything. This man is going to have a WILD ride on his next turn on the karmic wheel.

- Some of the things that White said to Tee were very Hmmmmmm..... He said that Tee promised he wouldn't be testy (just like Tee said White promised he would be obedient), and then said "you said you wanted to be friends with these people" which is an odd phrasing in a show where nothing seems like an accident. And wherever White was in that preview was not a friendly, upstanding place.

- Okay, wild theory time - what if White buys one of Non's organs? Non has to 'pay off his debt'. That can either mean sex trafficking or it could mean organ harvesting, which is something that has even been mentioned before by Tee. What if White's fear of being sick has to do with that, and he's black market buying a desperate person's organs? Or he could just be some fucked up rich person who likes to pay to hurt desperate poor people? The Other Mask in the black shoes has crutches. What if Non is maimed somehow?

I saw the marks were different, but I thought it was oversight. But it bothered me how “off” the scene felt, and how underwhelmed I felt by Phee’s actions/reactions this whole episode. Leaving behind the axe really bugged me too, I’m like “how has he gotten so stupid?”

If the long con is still at play (praying New is apart of this too), and if it’s a big scheme with multiple players? I’ll eat my words, take back every single, even slightly negative thing I’ve posted, and I will forever be this shows bitch, I swear. Like, I hated this episode.

So, here’s 🤞🏻.

I think Phee knows there’s another person there. He’s leading Jin back to the house but leading him in circles until he gets the mark from the person in the woods that it’s time to go back. The plan has always been to get them to kill each other in the house. So now that Jin has confessed, Phee is taking him back. He probably did want to spare Jin because he did seem the nicest of the friends, but now he’s being led in. Phee left the axe for the 9th person to pick up.

This is what I hope for sure, and I can see it. I definitely picture the 9th being Non, and I can see Phee, after Jin’s reveal, being actually surprised by it and not wanting it to be true. But then he knows he’s gotta bring Jin back into the chaos, and whatever happens happens.

New is definitely getting his wish, bc he wanted them to turn on and eat each other. The OG five are all made of weak stuff for sure. Jury is still out on Jin’s ending for me though.

that axe phee dropped will probably come in to play later, right? 👀 the way the camera lingered on it would suggest so

after rewatching the first four episodes, i'm convinced that phee either purposely lied to jin, or that he's just wrong about what happened. putting this under a spoiler tag for people who wanna go back and rewatch (do it - it's fun!):

there are scenes in the first two episodes where the masked killer is using crutches.

I'm also convinced that the axe will come back. I think Phee dropped it on purpose, and there was someone else (Non) in the woods with them marking the trees to purposely discombobulate Jin. And the crutch Mask also had black shoes, where Top had white shoes. There were two masks

also, something else that made me go 👀 in my rewatch, especially in episode 1, are the scenes between the phee and white.

i might be reading to much into this but... when they're making the movie, phee acts as the director, and white is his actor. the director/actor thing is emphasized (phee, i believe we're told, as studying to become a film director). and later, when tee scolds white ("i thought we agreed that you'd be nice if i brought you here. you'd be obedient"), white answers "I'm obidient. and one more thing, it's just acting."

there's also a moment early in the first episode where, having just watched the short film they made, phee nods to white when tan asks why they haven't introduced them to non. then phee nods to white again when white says something that convinces tee to agree to shoot a new short film.

ALSO also, and sorry for the rambling, but isn't white shown wearing the same type of school uniform as phee in one of the flashbacks?

Most of the stuff about Tan/New that Phee said to Jin is just what he thinks happened since he believe the only person who could do it is Tan. It is entirely possible that the person who killed Uncle Deng is someone else

This ep went by fast for me and felt almost fillery? probably because there were a lot of explanatory flashbacks and reveals that most viewers had already known/assumed so it was a matter of just bringing all the other characters up to speed.

I think Jin's confession about what he did to Non felt downplayed and seemed like they just wanted to get that out of the way to push forward with PheeJin (which I get bc they're the stars of this BL but idk if I could be with someone who did revenge porn). Also was there a point to having them going in circles?? I was hoping it was a set up for something intentional but nope, just several minutes of being lost. Honestly thought they could've had just the dialogue of Phee reassuring Jin and immediately cut to them finding their way out the woods.

Fluke is absolutely unhinged. His role as the bystander during Non's abuse is finally catching up to him and he's consumed by the guilt and frustration of it all. The actor is played the scenes really well! And is Top actually dead? I'm not a doctor but it seems like he was shot closer to his lower abdomen than stomach and could potentially live if he was treated? or I guess I'm supposed suspend my disbelief and assume a single bullet got him which I'm not mad about either 🤷🏻‍♀️

So based on the flashbacks and ep preview it looks like Non was made to work at a casino to pay off his debt? And maybe he meets White whose motives/connections with the whole group still aren't entirely clear? If they keep showing Non alive in these flashbacks could they be teasing that he's still alive? Part of me thinks no because if he has to endure that kind of hardship with nothing left to lose then a second suicide attempt wouldn't be out of character for him. I would love to be wrong, though.

2 episodes left and I still have so many questions!!

Yeah, something is definitely up. Even if they're agreeing New is out of his mind, both Phee and Jin have reasons to distrust the other extremely but are still ok? Phee tells him that they'd planned his whole thing out to drug them, admits that getting involved with Jin was because he was the easy target and then distanced after f**king only to bring them into this situation. Jin admits to recording and posting* the video out of jealousy and a one-sided crush which definitely accelerated Non's descent & disappearance...yet they still can work together? I actually thought Phee was going to try and attack him with the ax.

I feel deeply that there is more to Fluke's actions than just guilt for being a bystander/passive participant. Even his obsession with getting into school isn't holding up because now with 2 definitely dead and 1 severely injured, he can't think this will just vanish!

I'm also holding out that this is a plot by Non, simply given how he rewrote that script; he may attempt suicide again, but i feel he'd want revenge first on at least Tee (who's actions despite him feeling remorse now, were the ones that pushed Non the furthest on this path)

This felt like a filler episode. Atleast another person died though I wasn’t surprised that fluke pulled the trigger I knew he was going to kill someone due to his paranoia. 

The PheeJin confession was a little anticlimactic but if they are actually endgame then I guess it makes sense.

I can’t help but feel like we are headed towards a Phee vs Tan showdown and a Jin vs Non(alive?) showdown.

So anti climatic. I didn’t like that they were just ok with the reveals. Like, bb’s, it’s ok to feel a certain way about people doing bad things that affect you, even if you feel you don’t have a right to feel this.

Phee was an accomplice to a person that drugged Jin, and he remained complicit. Like Jin could’ve died from this. Jin posted a sex video of Phee’s then-boyfriend, which led to his down spiral, amongst many other things that should’ve never happened to Non. Non could’ve died just from this, committed suicide successfully.

I never wanted this scene to happen in the first place, but I hope Phee is lying and luring Jin into a false sense of security. Like, he’s assuming/telling very specific things that he shouldn’t know. Like how was he able to put 2 and 2 together in such a specific way.

Now, do I like Phee/Jin? Sure. Do I think they have chemistry? Absolutely! Do I need them to be endgame? Hell no I don’t!

Edit: I forgot Jin lied to the police about Non, which I’ll assume Phee already knew about anyway. He knows they all gave statements, might’ve even read them.

I’m pretty convinced that Phee isn’t out for revenge killing at this point. He just wanted answers for what happened to Non. Initially his lust for Jin got in the way and now he actually has feelings for jin. I think either they die together or survive together.

This has been my thinking since the team up in episode 8. I still think this, but things did not add up today with Phee. How did he flip his script so fast? Why did he refer to these assholes as “friends?” (This was so shocking to me.) Why does he still call Non his boyfriend? How does he place the axe on the ground, and seconds later, he forgets to pick it up again? How in the world is he revealing so many specific things about New in his confession, when he wasn’t present for most of this. They’re really specific assumptions on his part.

Finally, the scene in the woods is so noticeably weird. Does he have zero sense of direction? He’s the one leading, and he keeps leading them in circles, like three different times. And the marks on the tree are never the same. What was this scene?

The more I hone in on it, the weirder I feel about these things. Also, how does Jin know Tan’s real name again? Do I have to make another assumption?

I'm SO damn curious about where they are going with this because it feels way too early for us to have some of this information. So either they're kind of fumbling the ending (possible) or there are more surprises and twists in store for us that we're not expecting.

Today's ep actually gave me exactly what I was hoping - Phee and Jin talking to each other and seeing how their situations parallel - which of course means that I'm now highly suspicious of it, haha. Is Phee being genuine? Is Jin being genuine? I wonder...

I'm kind of sad at all the anger towards Phee because I'm actually kind of adoring that they're subverting the usual expectations towards horror. Everyone and their dog thought that Phee was out for revenge after ep 6, so I LOVE the fact that instead the show went 'actually...' We'll have to see how it plays out, I'm still kind of wondering if one or both of them is fooling the other.

Another possibility is that what they THINK happened is just not the case. This is mainly towards Phee - I'm really curious if he's setting Tan up? or even Jin, is it possible that he's the one at fault?? I don't know!

At any rate, I'm really curious to see the backstory play out more in the next ep and to finally get some answers on who Perth is and what happened to Non after we last saw him!

Ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
I am a little more suss about Phee after watching this episode. It's a pretty common horror trope for one character to tell another character all the horrible things the villain has done and then for there to be a reveal that actually, the teller was behind everything. It's one of those things that I don't think they're going to reveal that he was actually the one to kill Por and Uncle Deng, but if they did, it would make sense to me.

Jin's confession was pretty glossed over but I also think that right now, Phee's focus is getting them both out alive, since he's realizing how far off the deep end Tan has gone. I can totally buy him compartmentalizing that right now because he can't really react the way he would if they were not literally fighting for their lives.

I don’t understand how an episode can be so action packed and yet be filler at the same time 🤷‍♀️. Like what was this episode? It was 35 minutes, and we’re in the home stretch now. Grrrr.

This is a rant:

What was the whole PheeJin walking in an endless circle in the woods stuff? I get it’s to heighten a sense of foreboding and paranoia about where they are in relation to this “cult,” but it’s. just. filler. And they make it out in no time anyway, therefore I don’t care. Sorry, not sorry. (Also, I’m real tired of Jin just yelling AT people, particularly Phee.
My. Boy. Is. Trying. What’re you doing? What’ve you done?)

Also, the show’s strengths are in the complexity of its characters, and the actions they specifically take/don’t take that affect other characters. This drives the plot forward, not supernatural elements that get thrown in here and there to keep a certain “element” alive in the series.

Last thing, it’s already been established that the drugs are the source of the pandemonium sooo….yeah. For me, it’s not horror/supernatural, never has been. I just find it dumb and distracting, and it takes me out of the show. This particular thing has always bugged me, especially now that we’re near the endgame 🤷‍♀️.

Edit: Can anyone explain to me the point of Fluke calling out Tee on the leaked video in episode 4, but Jin states he’s responsible for all of it in this episode? I hope this isn’t a misfire.

😂😂😂 This made me lol, cause I’m exactly the opposite. I prefer the drugs over the supernatural (so I still get my way I guess, but the show’s not over yet), cause I never bought into it at all.

And when it’ll kind of pop up here/there, I get annoyed. So I haven’t made peace with this aspect. 😆

I’m like, “show, you are a suspense/psychological thriller BL. So can we let go of this other part and push forward. Without filler, please?”

Ugh! This episode was too short! Tbh, this felt like a filler episode. Other than Top getting killed and Tan jumping the shark, there was little story progression. And we only have 2 episodes left?

Finally, we have another death. We’re way too far into the series to have only one main character being killed.

I was gagged to find out that Tan purposefully orchestrated the deaths of Por and the uncle. He has truly gone off the deep end. I’m so excited for the inevitable showdown he will have with Phee at the end.

They have been ramping up the romance angle for Phee and Jin. At first, I was doubtful their love story would survive till the end but I guess the producers realize that this show is still a BL and we have to have some romance to root for.

Poor White! I truly have no idea what his fate holds at the end of this series. Either he will be a casualty of Tee’s actions or he’ll be the final girl. There’s no in between.

Yeah. You’d think Phee would have done more to put a stop to things the second he found out that New was killing people. Highly suspicious that he did nothing after a gruesome beheading of an innocent man. Has anyone checked his pockets for concertina wire?

I'm not sure what to make of this episode. I'm hoping that Phee is just a bad narrator and we don't really know what has happened yet. It's too easy to all be Tan/New. I still think there is another person involved and they are probably going to get that axe Phee conviently forgot about.

The Phee/Jin confession and Jin confronting Tan all felt a bit underwhelming and short. They heard the information and just moved on to the next thing. I'm hoping Phee is just in survival mode as I could have slapped him when he said, "let's go save our friends".

Next week looks promising, finally some Tee/White answers. White seems to be at the uncles place, does he help Non here? It was hard seeing them hurt Non on the rooftop.

Wait, I missed that, he said “our friends”?!? No! No! NOOOOO!!!! I guess I hated the whole scene so much that I only half payed attention.

That’s some jump the shark material right there. I can’t watch that, cause I don’t want to 🤮 in my mouth.

The math ain’t mathin for me on this, he HAS to be bullshitting. Right? Right?!?

That is a very specific betrayal to Non, and I can’t justify this at all if it isn’t addressed. Like wtf Phee?

Phee's reactions are strange - there is definitely more to it than that. Ta once described Phee as a manipulative character. He should have been angrier about the confession of the video release considering how it blew everything up. And the way his demeanor in the woods suddenly changed when he said "I will protect you". I don't think he was talking to Jin. They weren't alone in those woods.

I agree, he had me very confused this episode. I think he knows more than he's letting on. As soon as Jin confessed he conviently found an axe to escape and he knew full well about drinks being drugged but gave Jin that bottle of water. I find it hard to accept that after everything, he wants to protect that group.

I have a feeling Por's hallucination of Non was real as well. Was Tan not in the house?

Idk phee seems like once Jin confessed, Phee instead of trying to leave it was like we got to help our friends. Who really is a friend I think he told him to see if he had anything to do with Non. He didn't even get mad when Jin confessed to video and uploaded it.

With all the twists that have been coming up, I wouldn't be surprised if this is all Non's plot. He does have reason to be pissed at them all and he was clearly spiraling before disappearing. The only one he wouldn't really have been aware of at that time would be Jin's actions; but otherwise he'd have some anger to them al; including family. Mom clearly was picking favorites and not very supportive, dad was much like Jin in relative passiveness, and he's probably be jealous of New based on Mom's treatment. Phee abandoned him after the vid. White is the only "innocent bystander" for now at least

Jin’s and Phee’s suprisingly mild reactions to each other were… interesting. Jin is definitely giving off vibes, might not be right in the head.

Why on earth is Phee still being so sweet to him after knowing the shit he has done. Also Jin should be more upset knowing Phee was just using him to know what happened to his bf🥴

It's true when they say the most dangerous man is the one who has nothing to lose- Tan really has become my favourite character.

I literally watched the entire series rn just the last episode is ending I feel like everyone is so bad that u cannot justify anyone other than phee Like he did so much for non Telling his dad that he was part of scandal I honestly blame top and tee for all this since there were the one's who broke that camera and framed nom ig it wasn't for that movie or anything I feel like non would have just exchanged his school and also the fact that tan/new is just so heartbroken it's so sad. I feel the like only character that would be given a lil bit of sympathy would be jin ofc-no amount of hurt can make u leak a video like that but still he was hurt and non on the other hand was cheating on phee who was nothing but good to him always.

Non's entire family is less a family of people and more a collection of plot points. The show peaked in it's first 4 episodes. I can't believe I'm saying this about a show written by the same woman who wrote Manner of Death and Triage.

I've watched this show with a lot of fast forwarding (all of the horror scenes and the bullying scenes), so i know nothing about Fluke because up to this point, he's seemed completely pointless. I know all of the others, i know their names and their roles in the bullying, the filming, etc. But Fluke seemed to just be... there. And now he's centre stage. Which is interesting.
