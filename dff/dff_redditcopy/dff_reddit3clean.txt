almost the entire episode i was more terrified of fluke rather than the actual masked murderer
why on earth was he acting so scary who yells and shakes a guy who is already bleeding to death
plus the way he looked and talked to white when he saw him playing the disk
luckily from the look of next week he returns to normal
that masked murderer movements come off as laboured and stiff i think if they all werent so terrified they could overpower him


hope hes next to go


bocs cinematography
 my guess is that its actually top under the mask there might be some sort of possessionspirit transference thing going on like a summoning with the altar and the blood like with how por has been bleeding from the eyes then sleeping and now seizing thats just me throwing a prediction out there
 the locations in this show are gorgeous the cabin is both lush and lovely but also has that perfect isolated horror cabin feel and the woods around it are also stunningly and yet feel claustrophobic and the temple is beautiful but eerie the location scouts nailed it
 white is my fave character hes peak final girl i also love that he and tee feel like a real couple there is a lot of casual touching when they are around which we dont often get in bls unfortunately i believe that tees love for white is genuine like in the last episode got scared and swept up in tops hysteria but when he thought of white he realized what he was doing and how his first thought wasnt to save his own skin but to run to white even though it was running towards the killer
 top is panicky idiot 1 sorry were looking for a duhduh idiot  iykyk but fluke is suspicious idiot 1 not only does he not know anything about police procedure i dont like to give cops a ton of credit but they do know how to deduce when fingerprints are on a body incidentally and rule people out but being a creepy weirdo isnt helping your case bro i kinda like top even though hes hysterical honestly cant blame him  everyone likes to think they would be calm and collected in a horrific situation but thats actually not the norm but fluke can totally be the next person to die theres always at least one hella annoying character in an ensemble slasher that youre glad when they have a gruesome death axe murderer do you thing
 is it gay if you hide from a slasher in a coffin with your bro whose dick you just bit the day before asking for a friend


fully agree fluke is being so creepy i hope white is final girl but i am so scared hes gonna be an early out i feel like jin and phee are definitely solid as final couple final 2


in my villain era
filler episode this week gang no time stamps required  no spice no sexy
white is my favorite i like a character in a horror with common sense he was giving me bimbo vibes before but hes pretty collected
all the tropes again this week could have bet money tee would fall 
i was hoping wed get more backstory this week but looks like were just tension building and red herrings itll come
we end in a cliff hanger this week as well nicely played

i like white too hes giving final girl vibes or in this case final boy


in my villain era
im of the belief that final girl is final girl regardless of gender comment image

i feel the same way about white he pays attention hes smart and hes brave  he knew it was risky to go and try and watch the video but he did it anyway


bocs cinematography
i havent watched yet but i also love white he is peak final girl

im really enjoying this its a bit campy at times and this was more on display this week imo but i get the feeling that this was done pretty low budget haha
my favourites so far are phee jin and white but i really need to know more about phee and jins background because right now im very  about what happened between the two of them


bocs cinematography
i like the campiness because it makes it feel even more like a classic 70s80s teen slasher


wannabe doc is highly suspect he wants to shut up por might as well kill himconfrontation at the temple dude there are 4 of you only 1 of him he is not superhuman you already bashed the masked murderer he was down should have bashed him more removed his maskoh well still no barcodemaybe well get lucky next episode


we did see barcode dancing in the video for a few seconds 


cause of death the heart killers 
white should be protected at all costs i dont know how i feel about tee hes been falling out and in of my good side at least hes going back and he was all my faen and im also rooting for jinpheen i hope now that they are locked in that coffin theyll talk things out and kiss 
this story is giving me ten little indians vibes

this is sooo good oh my god i couldnt breathe
lmao i loved when tee was running after the murderer and fell down meanwhile the murderer just casually rode the motorbike dd


its so camp i was losing it

i love these kind of horrors

well now the killer is just not scary anymore  him taking the motorbike especially its a mundane sight that i never expect to see in a horror
but hes different from the spirit no so hopefully theres still some horror left


in my villain era
i loved the camp of it made me giggle just casually getting on the motorbike
now it could be one of the boys in disguise like a misdirect but im guess its probably non

im curious what makes you say this the slasher genre is oldschool horror actually some of it reminds me a bit of the scream series


which part
the one about the killer being not scary is just how i feel at this point i dont really watch horror so i have no point of reference that said in my imagination you wouldnt see how a killer get from one place to another they just appear and disappear so watching him get on that motorbike feel scooby dooy
the one about the spirit its because it seems that the shadowy hand that was involved in ep 1 sexy times is unrelated to this killer

it depends on the type of horror sometimes there is the element of the unknown but sometimes you see them doing mundane things the fear factor comes from the fact that their identity is unknown and that theyre trying to kill the main character for example here i think theyre also adding a heavy dose of mystery so the suspense comes from that more than from watching what theyre doing but theres also a teenslashercamp element thats a factor here
as for whether or not theres a spirit well have to see itd be unusual if they mixed genres but they may very well be boc is known to do things like that


oh god fluke trying to kill por shaking him up and moving the branch in the chest to shut him up its something i didnt expect clearly they did something horrible to non and theyre shitting bricks for it
white has been my favourite this week i like that under that apparent fragility he has the brains
at least its clear that the murderer its human that slopiness fighting and then running away with the motorbike tell clearly he is not a spirit 
i know its unlikely considering the situation but i would love if jin and phee have sexy time in the coffin 


man im loving this show so much and also cannot get over former macaus eyes like when did the baby get hot my brain and body are so confused


is this series worth checking out im currently watching the sign and pitbabe i also just watched kinnporsche for the first time so now im trying to find other series to get hooked on


if you like slasher horror with a lot of camp this isnt it


i feel the k is none other than nons dad or brother
