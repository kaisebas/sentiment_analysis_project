this week on i know what you did last songkran this show is hilarious there are so many classic stupid horror movie decisions i do believe that they missed an opportunity for a skin care product placement when white briefly developed those boils
i love the preview for the next episode and theres an autopsy we all will be doomed because they might figure out what killed the guy whose head is not attached to his body 
need sexy time next time
this one is really great out of context


in my villain era
i have serious questions about med school in thailand as glasses keeps insisting he will be a doctor


that uncles scene has made me fear strings now 


in my villain era
this is campy fun for days every horror trope you can imagine and i love it
poor por just laying on that couch bleeding out for someone whose been in medical school his first aid is pretty shit
i do love asian horror theyre all on board with the ghost business
and of course we know somthing bad happened in the past but sadly no spice this week just the usual screaming and running
episode 2  timestamps 
  sexy time   scarygore time
615  jump scare 
2700  2758  gory little jump scare 
3706  beheading 


no sexy time 


in my villain era
no  not this week sadly


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
in fairness theres not a whole lot he can do in this situation they knew enough not to pull the branch out but beyond that the kid needs a trauma surgeon and antibiotics to keep from getting septic

that uncle deng kill is comical they really went from a humble impaling to that in a single episode 


sad that this doesnt have many comments enjoying it tho the acting and effects are marginally questionable
the scare at the end was pretty gross but enjoying the tropes and the characters the ahole characters escaping without their friends is irritating but plays into the genre well bit sad cuz tee is so hot and was enjoying the couple but oh well


in my villain era
i think the horror part is deterring some also no sexy time this week


bocs cinematography
still loving that this is a horror show first also love that were seeing the divide between the friends group in the ones that helped film the first video and the ones that came after  you need a good divide in a large ensemble in a horror flick and we have the two shithead characters that you always get in horror that are freaking out and are just out for themselves in the panic at the motorcycle duo in tee and top tee is also hella hot
i also like that they arent afraid to show that killer mask in the daytime daytime often makes things look less scary and daylight is obviously less forgiving than dark light but even in bright light it still looks creepy i love the exposed teeth and lidless eyes


not panic at the motorcycle 


i am horrible  i started laughing when you know what happened with uncle dang he was gonna get that food to them no matter what


it is still a horror first and a bl second which is good  i am looking forward to the development and the various reveals concerning their relationships
also scary 


am here for jin coz he looks more and more like yamato i cant reach you ok first rule of survival never go off alone thats a sure fire way of getting killed beware of that hysterical screamer characteram talking bout you tophave we not learned from all those scream franchisemission destroy hard drive of nons short film coz its cursed the ringanyone who sees it will die the motorcycle duo went back the same way where uncle dang got decapitated wheres the wire when trying to escape stay on the hiway suddenly motorcycle duo was in the woodseverybody was hallucinating sights and sounds there must be something in the water lack of sleep stressedam still waiting for barcode


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
its always interesting to see what rules we have in one country that other countries dont follow in the us shows rarely have characters with names that start with the same letter because its more confusing for the audience to remember who is who meanwhile this show has nine characters 3 of whom have t names and basically all of whom have 3 letter names so far there are like 2 characters that i know their actual names versus the nicknames ive given them in my head



ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
have you ever watched tharntype that one is even worst like 75 of the characters on that show have t names its such a struggle 



i hope they take the route of one of the boys being the killer and not the ghost being the responsible
up to now jin is my favourite he is probably the murderer or at least he is at the center of it
phee is probably the main character and the most rational but i dont understand his relationship with jin he seems to like him nice scene in the woods  but at the same time he is very cocky with him
top and tee i think they wont last too much today they betrayed the group even if tee regretted it with he thought about white so maybe theyll die stupidly trying to run away or in a fight with the other boys

i know it wasnt funny but i almost laughed my lungs out when the uncle got decapitated his smile and then boom dd here is your food d
