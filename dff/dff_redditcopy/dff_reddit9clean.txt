i shouldnt be laughing but omg white  i have no idea how he could be involved in this but i sure hope he has good reasons to be caught up in the revenge scheme otherwise imagine if he really just wanted to hang out with his boyfriend  he signed up for a nice little getaway with his lover and instead everyones just losing their minds and dying 


bocs cinematography
that would be so fucking hilarious in a gallows humor way if that were true but i just cant think that sammon would leave this one character without the same levels of grey and nuance as every other character also there is that line that still sticks out to me as weird from the first episode where tee says that white promised he would be obedient if he came to the cabin like huh we know that tees a bastard hes still my fave character though but he doesnt seem controlling of white he melts to whatever white says and seems more jealous when other boys touch him
one thing ive wondered is that joe said non paid off his debt in gangster world we know that usually means prostitution perths character could also be a sex worker forced or not that comes into contact with non maybe white is similar



during the allout brawl when top was beating the crap out of tee whites face shifted from petrified to something like happiness for a couple seconds however in the next shot hes back to looking scared again since the cult doesnt seem to be a factor in the show so far its looking less likely that white could be part of the cult and more likely that hes connected to the mafia i wonder if he genuinely cares about tee at all or if hes at the house to enact vengeance on someone elses behalf like tees uncle with the revelations about phee and tan we know that every character except white in the house has their own agenda and secrets theyre hiding from somebody else
im super curious about whites identity at this point given that 23 of the new friends are infiltrators with ulterior motives if phees goal is to gather information and tannews is to instill fear and confusion to force a confession what could be driving white in the first episode its mentioned 3 times that he really wants to recreate the movie and implores tee to go along with phee and news suggestion since tan the biochemistry major is drugging them and inducing hallucinations is white the computer engineering major responsible for cutting the phone lines and tampering with the walkie talkies theres a couple instances where they seem to be closer than expected in episode 3 tan says he heard something and white tells him to have some water tan replies that he heard something for real as if he was trying to communicate with white when theyre looking for the hard drive he suggests that he and white go explore a room he found under the stairs and at one point he grabs whites hand as they run out of the room white tannew and non are also the only characters in the shows poster who arent splattered with blood although he does have a few specks on his face the implications of his name make his identity even more interesting in western literature the color white symbolizes purity and innocence but also serenity light and the allknowing truth and the flip side to white is black which is what the masked killer wears so many questions


white also had his worst fear revealed as std the blisters so i think he might maybe be a prostitute that tee met that way or he is on drugs i think he has some connection to the mob and thats how he met tee
and the uncle idk if that was a collective hallucination or something else but if hes dead for real then hes the true victim in all of this


the one on the scooter right with the drug in play it is possible that was a hallucination they will take the sheet off the body and find out there is nothing underneath


its possible that the uncle drove all the boys including non to the house and lied to the police afterwards so the killers would have a reason to target him



i have been rewatching episode 1 now that we know what we knowwhite is definitely in on it with phee and tan
they nod to each other in the first 10 mins of the show when phee puts on the film that they made
just the way the original ones nod to each other before the video is played not sure how they are linked but he is not there by chance in my opinion 
plus he is also keen for them to remake  continue the previous film he is vocal about that with tan  phee oh i cannot take the twists and turns
maybe white has a family member who got caught up in tees uncles business that could be the link

when he smacked his ass i fell i always knew he had it in him look who his brother is


ass worshipappreciation runs in the whole family and im thankful

definitely thankful

bocs cinematography
hahaha yeah i was kinda hoping that when he was taking jins pants down that he would dive in like that particular move with vegas and pete

same or i thought it phee would put jin on top of him you know


a minor family spinoff is what i need in my life come on boc make it happen

cause of death the heart killers 
im still reeling from that nc scene omfg that was good
but this comment is about the story and boy did we get some answers so tan is new which is great casting because he kinda looks like non  ive believed for a while now that this wasnt about ghosts but some other twisted story and im glad this is the route sammon took we have answers about the things they have been experiencing and im here for it
i wanna hug tan tbh because hes been through a lot but that smile at the end ugh the quiet part was the drug wont kill them but i sure hope they do themselves  this is a villain i can get behind
i still believe were missing a piece of the puzzle and that piece is white im not buying hes just a sweet bystander 
can i get more obsessed with ta i dont think i can but im willing to be proven wrong 

the part about hoping they do that was the vibe i was getting too tannew i also saw coming but im still living for it white was wearing the same uniform as phees before he went undercover so im assuming white must know phee in some capacity unless hes just an innocent bystander but given the plot doesnt make sense
also ta being double cheeked up is not what i expected but that was one of the better nc scenes ive seen recently granted im super new to bl so maybe theres better idk 

ive watched pretty much every nc scene ever made in bl even scenes from shows i havent watched im a nc sceneconnoisseur and it was definitely one of the better ones the only problem i had was the camera moving awayaround too much


cause of death the heart killers 
that camera shaking they have sometimes i dont know if they wanna give the vibe of found footage to this part too are we being inceptioned a film within a film within a film comment image


cause of death the heart killers 
ta was not afraid of success and i thank the bl gods for it boc seems to deliver in the cheek department and im here for it

that part ta saw how bible mile and apo did scenes and took notes 


he take after his brother bible 

another person commented here saying it must run in the family 

in my villain era
im hoping for an 11th hour twist with my final girl white
the twist in todays episode makes me think of the movie shrooms and it explains quite a bit but it felt like it telegraphed the rest of the series really hope they have more in store sammon though can be hit and miss


cause of death the heart killers 
ive enjoyed manner of death and triage what else does she have under her sleeve


in my villain era
i hated the mod novel loved the series though transplant the sequel novel was way better then the original
triage novel was better but the series was better
i am excited for spare me your mercy its by far her best book and track record shows the adaptation will be even better i have high hopes

bocs cinematography
i think there still might be something supernatural going on or its not all just newtan remember the first time they went to the mansion to film por saw something behind the shrine when he was filming and it vanished this was long before any drugs came into play and non was still very much around


cause of death the heart killers 
im mostly basing my theory on sammon usually not going the supernatural route well see how this goes although i believe new wont survive this and he wont mind he has nothing left 


bocs cinematography
oh absolutely  he was already ready to die when phee found him i think this is his own extended suicide but hes taking everyone else with him


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant fault him though 


bocs cinematography
no me neither i cant say what id do in that situation i have a really bad temper so it would probably be something similar hes in scorched earth mode because there is nothing left for him he gave up his real schooling in england his parents sold their home so he has no real home anymore both parents are dead and non is either dead or missing he has no future and no hope and nothing to cling to other than revenge


cause of death the heart killers 
this was really his villain origin story 

if there is an actual curse aspect its on nons family at this point but i agree that newtan is a sinking ship and he has no intention on leaving anyone behind


i stand by phee ta what the hell was that do it again please
on a sadder note poor newtan also i think phee fell for jin but for the sake of the whole revenge plan had to push him away


do it fcking again phee ta out did his character to the tea



bocs cinematography
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh another fucking week of losing my mind with theories
 it was in the back of my mind that it was a drug induced haze so if newtans drug induces their worst fears and secrets whats up with white seeing boils all over himself
 fuck i feel so bad for new he lost everything all he has his is cold cold revenge to wrap himself in at night hes become a batman villain plotting his revenge in his chemistry lab
 we still know nothing about white we see him briefly and hes already tees boyfriend but how did they meet he goes to a different school was it a dating app like how phee and non met still so many questions there and there was that one weird moment when they were filming the redo of the movie where phee held whites hand and they had a moment was it just because of oh thats tees boyfriend and tee is very jealous but then phee purposely had jin caressing white for the take knowing it would make tee hit the roof
 what if theres more to whats going on with jin we see that while he took the video there is definite probable evidence that he didnt leak it since his laptop shorted out so non betrays him then he develops feelings for someone else and phee rejects him honestly the pain in jins eyes when phee shut him down was such good acting on coppers part you could see his heart breaking what if hes like fuck all these people for forgetting about non and fuck phee and tan for going behind my back is what he thinks since hes convinced that phee and tan were screwing
 keng still alive in the preview for next week we see what could be him hes wearing the watch with joe and his goons but it could also be perths character since hes also got the blondish hair and when we see the hands holding up the mask its a similar shirt cuff to the shirt that keng is wearing
 i think that theres definitely more than one revenge plot going on here and there still might be supernatural things happening  when they went the first time to the mansion for filming por saw the masked figure hiding behind the shrine when he filmed it and there was no drugs in play there and non was still around so there was no reason for revenge on anyones part other than non
 wow that was an nc scene ass slaps and blow jobs and thrusting and nudity and everything and phee definitely caught feelings for jin and then seeing the article about nons disappearance made him realize that he really was cheating on non and it wasnt just fucking him for info the part at the lake where phee was describing non was so sad
edit also watching that nc scene again for research purposes of course of course they were framed in the window  not only was it just a cool shot cinematically but what if someone saw them

the boils thing i wonder if thats whites worst fear maybe an sti ive always wondered if hes involved with the mafia as a prostitute and thats when he meets non  in the preview next week we see non and the teacher on the rooftop with the mafia wearing the same clothes as the photo on the news article about them running away on a bus together which leads me to think they are both still alive you could be right about keng


bocs cinematography
i also was wondering for that path for white perths character has yet to be shown more and i think hes in the same path when joe said nons working off his debt we know what that means when a mafioso type says that  forced prostitution and that would kind of align with how jealous tee is of other guys touching white and how he said if you came you said youd be obedient

there was a scene when tee went to visit the mafia guys and there was a young looking boy with the men ive wondered about white since then i get the feeling phee or tan didnt plan the trap in the woods for por or any killing i think tan wanted to drug them for confessions and its icing on the cake that they are attacking each other so theres one or two masked people running around and weve already seen if given a weapon non will use it plus the ideas are straight out of his script we dont know much about keng why was he trying to get into the mafia casino is he the one capable of beheading poor scooter guy cant wait for next week

saturdays have become the day where i spend hours refreshing my iqiyi app so i can watch dff as soon as its available and wow todays was so much tan being new wasnt a surprise per se but given how many questions weve had about him this whole time we got some answers
white is still a mystery he seems to be an innocent bystander but he had on the same uniform as phee did before switching schools and my thought is he potentially knew phee beforehand in some capacity otherwise hes just being traumatized wanting to spend time on vacation with his partner which really sucks 
i also have to give copper his due credit we knew ta would serve its not his first rodeo as far as being in a series but wow he and copper served as soon as that first slap connected i knew this was serious ta being cheeked up twice in one series was not what i expected tbh jins reaction to ta makes so much sense now
this show is working my brain overtime and i have more thoughts but ill leave it at this is one of my favorite shows period so far and i hope the momentum keeps up

hi me again still working this episodeshow through my brain i wanted to mention the writing of the show here because i see so many parallels between character interactions and my mind goes to generational trauma and how that gets passed on and i see a lot of that written in a way thats realistic and that isnt shy about looking at how each characters own histories influence the cycles of traumapain being inflicted which makes some of the decisions made make sense even if they arent the best however you might want to define it some bls ive seen im new to them so my experience here is limited lol are very surface level which isnt necessarily a bad thing but i just really appreciate the depth given to dff i might be rambling here but yeah wow this show its a good one


this might be super crazy but what if white is phees brother honestly a lot of things arent totally adding up in my head but i just believe so badly that phee and white have some connections
i dont believe white is just colateral top was beating the shit out of tee and white took his sweet time to help his boyfriend lol  you could say that he was terrified but he legit waited like he wanted to punish tee lol  oh maybe its all in my head  we have yet to see


bocs cinematography
considering how all the other characters are i just cant see sammon not giving white some more nuance and grey and layers since every other character has it there is the definite desire to freeze in traumatic situations but sometimes he seems very calm and other times hes freezing up or being generally clumsy maybe purposefully i think there is definitely more to the story there


i noticed that too phee said he was unsure that theyll make it out so it seemed like their plan had gone out of control somehow tans plan involved hallucinogens only rather than murder unless he had planned further without phees knowledge i think phee and tan arent the only ones plotting revenge

omgg i was literally yelling at my phone white stood there for 3 to 5 business days

i went back to that altercation and you are absolutely right there was a brief moment where whites expression didnt look frozen but more exhilarated somehow he had a bit of a grin on his face as tee was getting pummeled and then went into frozen and then moved to help him white as more than final girl and the one who actually was punishing them would be interesting and we know sammon loves her crazy twists stuff that is completely off the radar
didnt expect tannew to be just as unhinged as non but both of their parents are dead so i guess it makes sense  phee does have feelings for jin so i wonder whats gonna happen when they find out the truth about everything the pheejin nc scene was hot


considering the mother it does seem like mental illness runs in the family so not surprised that newtan leans towards that as well

wow this was a muchneeded episode us viewers finally get confirmation on a lot of theories and speculations built up over the last few episodes
nons family is alltheway tragic i know a lot of the responsibility falls on the parents for how they turned out but adding variables such as their socioeconomic status the corrupt justice system societys poor regard for mental health its hard not to feely pity towards this family watching the mom was just so heartbreaking
finally we get to know tan after him being missing from all of act 2 im surprised to see that hes a more important character than i initially thought the biggest question mark we have now is white and i hope that hell be more than just a boyfriend that gets accidentally caught in a crossfire of revenge
i wonder what phee and tans end game is after the bullies expose themselves then what it definitely feels like theres a bigger fish to fry than just the bully crew somethings going on thats beyond the revenge duos control im so curious


bocs cinematography
yeah i also feel there is something else going on besides just what phee and tan have going on i also feel that newtan is on another level of revenge than phee wants hes got nothing left and is doing an extended suicide phee asked if the drug would hurt them and newtan assured phee it wouldnt  but im not so sure and i wonder if phee also has things going on that hes not telling tan the whole thing with tees uncle and his death still has to be answered
we got a lot of questions answered but i feel like those questions brought up more questions god i love this show
well phee definitely took his role of becoming jins friend to get information seriously even tried to slap the information out of him
seriously though im loving all of your theories 100 there is more to white and i cant wait to find out what phee clearly likes jin but had to support tan and his villainous plan that lab though lol i think its amazing how well they kept tan in the background until now ahh this show is so good

listen phee i dont care if you fall in love with jin were sticking to the plan so i dont want to see your heart flinch jin is one of the bullies remember  


that nc scene took me by surprise in the best way possible that was amazing i guess getting some answers was nice too but the 



im sorry but tans evil scientist lab with evil green lighting is kinda funny in the campy way
i need answers about white immediately he is too suspicious since phee told jin that he wasnt sure if theyd make it out alive either him and tans plan mustve gone out of control andor there must be some other plan in motion that he wasnt aware of
its pretty clear that tan had dragged top to the cult building and drugged him but are his hallucinogens able to mindcontrol top to become the masked murderer and kill por that seems implausible and i think there are other factors at play
and we still dont know who caused pors knife marks por being led to get stabbed by the branch and the uncle who was beheaded question is did tan do it im certain that he was involved somehow but whether he involved in all of it or if there was another party is another question
this episode delivered so muuuch im happy
first of all this episode finally answered something for me what set all of this off weve known since early on that the events in the past were quite some time ago which always left me wondering why the time gap and why phee and whoever else before today acted now
we finally got the answer to that question at the end of this episode with the reveal about non and news parents in news eyes he has nothing left at this point and hes riddled with guilt and rage even in the past he was clearly driven by both but theyll be even worse now that hes also lost both his parents i can only imagine the sense of responsibility that weighs on him because with each and every one of them theres a theme  hes not there
which begs the question what has he been doing for the past two years he didnt go back to his normal life that much is clear from his conversation with his father but he also hasnt been around in the preview for the next episode it shows a figure mixing something seemingly surrounded by the same hangings weve seen around the cult stuff  did new get drawn into the cult
now lets go to the other major arc in this episode  phee  jin
as soon as the cast started asking is pheejin real last night it confirmed for me that phee had been in it mostly for info so i wasnt really surprised
however i am deliciously pleasantly surprised by what this episode delivered in terms of pheejin crumbs
first of all its clear that phees actions are driven by a desire for information rather than revenge i know that some people have speculated that having sex with jin was a revenge tactic but i have to ask  revenge for what at this point all he knows is that non was involved with the group before they disappeared and that they stole his script would he really go to the lengths of deliberately seducing someone based on that
now thats not to say that doing it for information only is much better but theres still a key difference there one is designed to get close and find out more the other is designed to hurt and everything that phee did in this episode seems geared more towards the first rather than the latter
im also not convinced that phee actually had sex with jin for information only because  having told new that hes slept with jin to get closer and to get information  what does he do does he use that tactic to spend more time with jin perhaps try to go out on dates with teewhite or the rest of the group to exploit his connection try to ask jin questions about non
nope instead he promptly pulls away fast and hard  and that tells me that maybe the sex wasnt about information at all  or that he realizes that he cant keep staying that close to jin without getting in over his head his actions simply do not jive with someone who is trying to use having sex with jin for information or revenge keep in mind that he simply does not know enough at this stage to match a im going to break jins heart goal
now as to whats going on in the present  we see a few other things we see phee trying to call jin and my first thought was oh this will be when he suggests that they get together  because that would track with phees professed goal of using jin for information but that didnt happen jin didnt answer but also  por is the one who suggests the trip not only that but we then see phee trying to see jin in person and then in the scenes out at the cabin we see him seemingly getting really worried when jin starts hallucinating
now theres a small chance that phee is going to use this to try and get information from jin  i wouldnt really blame him tbh but with his overall behaviour etc i think its clear that phee is more conflicted than hed like to be about jin
other thoughts and observations
at the end of the episode we see a preview and at the very end of it we see two things non and someone else probably keng lying down and then a shot of tee  and guess what tees clothes are the ones that he wore during the interrogation scene in the last episode which is after the boys had gone back to town and people realized that non had disappeared we only learned just last week that tee was directly involved in nons disappearance in the first place but now were learning something else on top of that  he saw non after all the other boys did to our knowledge he may be the only other person who has
its hilarious that phee ends up going to school in jins uniform which has his name on it like can you imagine hahaha thats how tan knows that he slept with jin
i think thats it for now but im sat and hoping that this show continues to go the direction i think it might because weve got all the crumbs brewing for a delicious conflict
oh and also  im still soooo curious about white because we didnt even see his backstory yet whats the deal with our innocent boy and when are we going to find out about perth

cause of death the heart killers 
when i heard that first spanking sound i was deadly wounded then we got phees butt front and centered and it was the coup de grace

the spank was personal and i was shook
i am screaming tas naked little cute booty i am traumatically shook

wow ta is so hot that was one of the best nc scenes ive seen in a minute as far as the actors performance goes


yep undie free with buns included cant beat that p

im shook right now that was so good ta is incredible i hope he gets more lead roles in bl


two wordsthe spanking 


cause of death the heart killers 
so good rivs so fing good

right

pakin girlie 
woooooof 


cause of death the heart killers 
i was howling alright
2940 start there
the way i was screaming and hitting my pillow it was unbelievable  10000000010


gonna get this out of the way and say i want more nc scenes with ta my god i actually think i had an out of body experience when he slapped jins ass not once but twice and then gave us a whole shot of his backside  that man is serving in every damn episode phee is also so so boyfriend material the way he takes care of people nonjinnew ughhhhh i guess im a ta stan now  
now for plot stuff  i think we all knew new tans connection with the group so the reveal didnt seem surprising though i will say im impressed by how new portrays himself as tan vs how he actually is  definitely two different personalities
im curious if the pheejin romance is gonna follow the trope of i initially pursued you for ulterior motives but then caught feelings and now i must push you away but well eventually come back to each other and somehow overcome the reveal that jin was the recorder of the video even if he didnt leak it 
nons parentsomg what tragic situation for this whole family  newtan losing his whole family in 3 years and he still couldnt find anything about non
so it looks like drugs were the reason that drove the events at the cabin and not actual paranormal stuff  i had a feeling that was the case but does this mean tan also orchestrated the uncles beheading and pors impaling as well those were pretty gruesome and its hard to believe he would go that far with his plans
preview for next week looks so intense how many eps do we have left im not ready for this to be over 

considering both his parents killed themselves i think tan did orchestrated uncle and pors death he has nothing left to lose no reason to live other than vengeance and he might as well plan to kill himself after all is done i think he planned some things on his own without phee knowing


bocs cinematography
this he is absolutely in scorched earth mode hes going down and taking them all with him unlike phee hes on a oneway journey

hoeing for boeing
i cant i just cant i need to know the ending but i also need the messy ride


man this gets extra hot then extra dark but at least now we kind of know whats going on  
more importantly is his butt always that big and i just never noticed or is it just the angle thats the real mystery


bocs cinematography
i think weve only scratched the surface of whats going on this show makes you feel like now you know everything but you really know nothing

this show is so good 

this show is so fucking good 


taphee is the hottest thing on earth no wonder jin saw him the first time and immediately had a crush on him


this might be the show im most excited about to end so i can binge i almost always watch shows as they air but i also cant handle horror and unpredictable endings so i gotta wait on this one
but you tell me theres spanking now too oooooof im so ready

total ho for supanuts smile
anyone else feel like they need an emotional support groupanimalhug after this its not just me right
this show is dragging us through the ringer emotions wise i went into this expecting a horror show and what its delivering is so far beyond just a simple horror show


bocs cinematography
i saw on twitter something i completely forgot about jin was calling non during nons suicide attempt where phee came to rescue him what happened there they never went back to it

they also didnt show what happened to phee and non during that convo so im not sure if its going to become relevant or whether they just overlooked itcut it

yeah i was disappointed that episode 7 didnt pick up right where epi 6 left off like jin was heading towards the house and phee was already there with non also they never talked about nons suicide attempt either nothing thats frustrating for me


i am so thrilled ta came thru  i saw his potential way back when and he lived up to it woah  and copper is stunning and also did amazing
two epic  bl scenes back to back weekends

total ho for supanuts smile
im totally saving that post and i definitely saved a bunch of photos

in my villain era
so as i expected the plan was to investigate what happened to non tan being new was a good little surprise i was thinking it was a possibility when he was introduced last week
theyve finally clarified the timeframe bigger gap then id thought that two year jump was a big one certainly took a dark turn at the end of the episode
i wish we hadnt got the big exposition dump though sort of took the fun of speculation out it it dose sort of remind me of the movie shrooms solid irish horror film
ta is single handedly pulling off what entirety of playboyy cannot
trigger warning   suicide
516  jump scare

profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
just came here to say i rewatched the soccer scene a few times thank you tee for being shirtless 


omg cuz same ugh why does tee have to be so terrible and yet so fine tt like white pls share but also tee give me white i can protect him while you pay for being an ahole

ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
im assuming most people noticed this but when tan asks phee if hes cheating on non phee is wearing jins shirt
one thing that really irks me is that in episode 1 tan and phee ask about the short film as if theyve never heard of it and one of them says that they never finished it obviously they did finish it and even showed it to people and phee and tan mention it to them multiple times in this episode
i definitely dont think that phee was fully aware of everything that tannew is planning for the cabin do we know who brought the gun up still curious to see what happened that got the uncle decapitated unless he somehow faked that to add to everyones paranoia and fear
now that we know so much more about all the backstory i want to go back and rewatch the first few episodes with all the new context and see what ive missed also now that i can actually tell the characters apart
also currently on team non and keng are still alive



this show is bonkers and im ok with that i was waiting on this episode most besides nons arrival of course ill go down the list
likes
phee  im in  with his character but i love ta so im biased but phee is less intense about the revenge than i thought hed be like hes so calm and level headed about this he seems to be trying to assess the situation as a whole and not jump to conclusions he should be a cop like his dad
pheejin  i wasnt prepared  but theyre  i just wish the scene was shot more from the side i wanted to see more of coppers body plus i wanted to get a good look at their kisses too also i got the impression that was their only time together and it ended just as soon as it began if so thats  this probably went on for awhile i just wish i knew how long the scene at the river idk lake was really lovely calm and warm i loved how phee described non to jin 
tan  mio was  he said oh yall wanna see me get ready surprised in the best way possible this poor family has carried so much sadness and heartbreak its like they were cursed or something mental health issues run in the family so id be losing my marbles too hes the one whos really out for blood the scene with himnon was  i dig how direct he is with the questions he doesnt beat around the bush whatsoever
white  im convinced hes an innocent bystander whos there for a good time not a long time  but hes definitely the final girl hes smart but just scared to death bc duh plus i think its perths character who was behind the door at the police station and hes investigating the horse account otherwise white could be pulling a 21 jump street
the quick exchange between toptan about the test you didnt study dumbass 
dislikes
the show subverts my predictionsexpectations but im not completely satisfied its like the episodes are a meal im getting the calories and there is flavor but its not enough so im not fully satisfied
so am i to believe that phee gives the game away to jin bc he feels guilty about the drugs is that how this goes down show huh thats not satisfying for me
i just really wanted a reveal either by accident or intentional to the whole group all at once i wanted all the shock that comes with it i wanted anger drama  tears yelling fighting i wanted por to know the truth before he died cause he was an awful person i guess we may still get a scene like that but 
i just wanted all of these asshats to know that non has people who love him they werent there when it counted which is eating them up inside but if the group thought this was put behind them it never was i wanted that flavor more than anything for this show
real world talk they all deserve prison time and non would go to a mental health facility he did try to kill these guys
unfortunately pheetan would get the worst of it if the drugs are the cause they inadvertently caused por to die cause he was drugged now the uncle is another story bc who set up the damn wire cutter was it top tan
i really dont think theres a supernatural element at all going on here its all smoke and mirrors and theyre hallucinating all this stuff

each week i am amazed
since episode 5 we are in a rollercoaster that gives everything we have answers and new mysteries things connect like a jigsaw some things we anticipate and some we dont it is so good gastronomic serie
new is tan is good we were all still wondering so much mio can finally shine and honestly for someone who did not want to act who just wanted to be like jeff satur and do music that boy served they all do but i am so happy with his part
the family drama is terrible the tiny things accumulating  forgetting about your siblings because your own struggles are more important comparing your children wanting the best for them and being absent in the process these four people loved each other as families well except from non to new because new never invested in their relationship and also probably jaleousy the parents fighting but loving each other so much the many regrets the mothers regret in berating non the fathers regret in hitting non news regret in being too absent first from nons life but then he does the same to his parents the fathers regret to have doted on new forgetting non in the process all this to end up with new not being worth it not really but i am voicing his feelings and non gone true tragedy and we all feel like it will not end well for new will non actually be the last one standing yes i am in denial my boy will come back
also the realisation that tan and phee know nothing they know there are two scripts and that one the last one found in his room is from non they know non had sex with the teacher and they are vaguely aware of the horse accounts everything else we know they dont no wonder they at least phee are still testing water
phee is such a lovely boy rightful warm also horny  ta is doing so well i hope he gets some recognition for his work here and i am not only talking about the nc which was incredibly hot no wonder they joke about their intimacy he deserves to rise in the rank at boc they dont have ranks but you know what i mean
i am looking forward to phees emotional journey because he is at a tipping point wouldnt it be terrible for non to come back now that phee seems to have decided to go for jin spurred by his future departure  yes 2 years ago phee was still in love but what of now
the mystery around white thickens so he arrived in between and we see him already being lovey dovey with tee so their thing is long term bumps mv revealed a lot of their future scene so following flashback will concentrate on teewhite i am so pumped
also the preview  whose voice is screaming about non will phee and jin die for each other or is jin truly the final girl like in the movie will their relationship overcome all the revelations coming is perth protecting non or just idk i need to know more about that scene


newtan thats right get dem ollike pokemoni guess top got the smokes with the xhe was most delulu and violentphee has developed feelings for jinlooking forward to the next eps


omg ta  i still see baby macau and i cant  anyways
thats complete nonsense with the cigarettes and antidotes anyways ill buy it xd
i love how the plot works and how we keep switching time like i love it im not even mad like its tense in all times so yeah xd
im way too invested ha 

is tacopper the mini mileapo because that was hoooot ta is hot fine fcking ass respectfully 

im late to the post but damn this series keeps surprising me and i have no clue what to expect next
i expected phee to try and get close to jin but i didnt expect him to take him to his spot he took non and then did that with him all of a sudden when he took him home  bruh
also totally called tan being nons bro their whole family was so fcked up and sad ugh now i can see why everything is the way it is
i suspected some supernatural shenanigans likeit cant all just be new using the hallucinations to trick everyone bc por died the same way non wrote it in his script 


i will be so mad if non and keng are both alive together it just ruins everything

im wicked late to this show and only just caught up but have to scream into the void somehow bc holy shit i did not expect this show to hit this hard i have no organization really to my thoughts at this point so im just gonna spew my random brain farts into the ether bc i need to release them somehow
first thought is barcode now ive never been shy about my distaste for his character and disappointment in his performance in kp i think porchay should have had more bite and agency and i stand by my opinion that barcode was too young and inexperienced for the role at the time however whatever hes done in the meantime whatever workshops boc put him through fuckin worked bc wow is he blowing me away and in my defense even when i was wishing theyd casted someone else and written porchay differently i always knew barcode was a good kid and hoped he got as much opportunity as he wanted to work on better projects and in healthier sets away from the disgusting groomer kp writers im so so glad that he got to do this and actually flex those acting muscles hes been quietly building since kp non is a wildly complicated character who goes through sooo many changes yet barcode is making him so believable and grounded despite the hysterics and crazy scenarios
second revelation was ta macau was a pretty minor part of kp he only had a few scenes and beyond some thirsting after fans caught on that hes packin a wicked body i dont think hed really gotten any chance to shine i certainly hadnt thought much of him since kp well thats a serious oversight cus wow is he also acting his tight little ass off in this show too he doesnt get to hit the sort of extremes that barcode or mio do but hes got me believing all of phees motivations and reactions which is what matters i do think he has mastered chemistry w his bl partners a little more than his overall acting but his romantic relationships are the center of our attention for his character so thats actually a smart thing to focus on if he can truly make me believe that he adored non which he does and is genuinely conflicted about getting close to jin for dishonest reasons which again im buying that fully then im less fussed about whether his got exactly the right reaction or line delivery in other scenes
weve only really had 1 ep of properly getting to know him but mio is also killing it so far as tannew i kind of had a feeling that tan would secretly be tied to non somehow from pretty early on and i had phees connection spoiled by twitter before i even started binging to catch up so as soon as they mentioned that non had a brother studying abroad i kind of knew it had to be tan but still i do really like how they revealed it and ye gods does my heart break for him when he loses both parents and is overcome by guilt feeling like hes the real cause of all of his familys deaths
although i wish wed gotten more of news decent into drugs and revenge it just seemed like an abrupt leap from him frolicking w the bully gang surreptitiously trying to get them to spill about non to suddenly being 23 years later and hes gone all walter white was he already studying chemistry where did this idea of drugging them into admitting the truth even come from what drove him to that extreme for that matter as tightly plotted as the rest of the show has been his whole plan w phee seems very flimsy how would he even get registered for school wout his parents knowing how did he avoid them seeing him for like 3 whole years when they thought he was abroad but really in the same city wouldnt the school have recognized him or did he go to a different high school than non did none of the others in the bully gang get suspicious that he never talks about his family or invites them home but they have skipped around quite a bit to reveal things out of order so perhaps well get more info on how this all came together later maybe he got the idea from one of nons stories or nons favorite old horror movie
the other loose end im hoping well get an answer to soon is wee baby white he just pops up randomly as tees boyfriend which sidenote regardless of how awful they all are its oddly heartwarming to see that not one of them has a drop of homophobia on display and unquestioningly accepts when one of them starts dating a boy kind of a fun reversal of the homophobic bully trope wearing a different uniform so clearly he never went to their school it doesnt make sense for him to have absolutely no connection to the main plot but again he never went to school w them so its not very likely that he knew non but i was thinking maybe he did know keng what if he went to school w phee before he transferred and maybe they were casual friends or acquaintances so he knew phee had a boyfriend and even saw a picture of them together he could have been groomed and raped bc minors cannot consent so it is always rape by keng in the past so when he saw the news about keng running off w non he went to phee to explain how predatory keng was so that phee wont blame non anymore and white decides to join the revengetruth plan bc he thinks keng might have been the one to disappear non so he needs the truth to be sure that keng wont come back for him when hes done w non or just for closure if keng is really dead or i could be overthinking it and hes really a follower of that suicide cult who stumbled into the jackpot of easy sacrifices lol

quick thoughts on the rest of the castcharacters i fucking hate top and i really dont like jets performance as him hes really the only purely awful character and i cant stand anyone who only communicates in screamshouts thought im sure jet is a lovely guy irl i just wish someone had taught him how to deliver a line without flailing i actually empathized w por a lot more before we got the backstory even tho he didnt do nearly as much to directly harm non as tee and top have the whole boo hoo my dad might smack me around a bit and i have so much pressure as the son of a politician really isnt working on me as an empathy tactic bc my eat the rich mentality is too strong lol fluke im kinda torn on i kinda feel like we dont know him well enough to buy his whole present day meltdown at the cabin but i also cant entirely hate him bc he did have kind of the least to do w nons downfall though much like jin theres an argument to be made for a silent spectator being worse than an actual assailant he knows for sure that top broke the camera and tee agreed to help cover it up so he has to have put the pieces together of what tee put non through yet he said nothing bc he is so stuck on that upward social mobility that being a doctor could get him that he wont do anything that might rock the boat and jin oh you poor lovesick idiot im not really sure why he even stays friends with the bully gang all its a bit odd that he repeatedly chooses them over non yet claims to be so in love w non that hes devastated by seeing him w another boy and enraged enough to post revenge porn when he finds non being raped by a teacher which would be child pornography technically and yet i do buy that he genuinely falls for nons awkward charms and creative mind just as much as he falls for phees chivalrous kindness and devastating dick coppers chemistry w both ta and barcode is undeniable in the end jin is just a dumb teenager in love who follows his emotions but like fluke is too afraid to rock the boat when it comes to his social circle tee has to be the most complex of the bunch even tho admittedly i dont think jjays performance usually reflects that hes clearly trapped in a really awful situation but choosing non of all people to drag down to hell just to save his own ass is a special kind of awful he seems to be so ready to throw non under the bus yet clearly feels guilty later and also appears to be totally whipped for white
oh and maybe someone can answer this question why is non even bullied in the first place where did the nickname greasy come from he doesnt look greasy at all nor does he really have any other qualities that would normally get a kid bullied did they specify somewhere and i just wasnt paying close enough attention or maybe thats info well get later i do remember when phee was asking non to be his boyfriend he mentioned that non had a lot of tough times in the past and hes obviously taking some sort of medication for depression or something perhaps he had a public mental health crisis a breakdown at school that caused the other students to ostracize him bc of the stigma around mental health issues or his weird emo stories got leaked to the school and he was branded a weirdo
overall its wild how theyve managed to weave a complex but mostly understandable web with even more complex characters even keng who only has a handful of scenes but occupies a big presence in the current part of the mystery as a paradoxical predatory rapist and freelance crime investigator though do we know if he was grooming non as part of his plan to expose the gambling ring or was that an unplanned manifestation of his worst urges the technical aspects arent always ideal you can definitely tell that they did not have a kp level budget for this and i still think a lot of the actors needed more time to mature before taking on these roles but damn the story is hitting all the notes the pacing is perfect even the time jumps back and forth are surprisingly easy to follow as long as youre patient theres still time to fuck up the landing of course though tbh i kind of dont care how it ends despite all my questions and it being such a mysteryfocused show im much more invested in the characters and the experiences of watching it all unfold so i dont think ill mind however it resolves or leaves unresolved everything
