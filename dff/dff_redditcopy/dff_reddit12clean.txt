whiiiiiiiiiitteeeeeeeee 

the only real innocent in that bunch qq even if his fear for some god damn reason is being covered in stds like what the hell was his backstory for that to be his biggest fear oo

or he might feelthink being gay is dirty


cause of death the heart killers 
they were doing too much emphasis on tee waiting 2 years for him amd then whiye crying that he had had only him

ikr i feel so sad idc about anyone else dying but not sweet white


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
he didnt deserve that


i really liked new and nons last scene for me it was the best moment of this episode he needed that i dont mind him being dead at the end cause there was no life after all of this


bocs cinematography
he was never coming back this was extended suicide he had nothing to go back to new got what he wanted and even getting shot is kind of what he wanted he got nons forgiveness and he can be with his family again


yeah i really liked when non thanked him overall the best outcome for new


cause of death the heart killers 
there was no life after all of this
sadly true

deep sorrow thats what i felti was in tears

man i am actually so impressed with the ending of the show because they constructed it in a way that allows people to kind of headcanon what they want from it you can either think of it as phee and jin got out but what happened with non will always haunt them and tee is a miserable mess just like his father was or you can believe that they all died there theres also the possibility that the ending is the three of them still there hallucinating and they havent actually escaped yet
so much heartbreak i havent done anything becomes so much more meaningful
new losing sight of what non would have wanted doomed him in the narrative but they also alluded to what a lot of fans wanted with non thanking him a hallucination nons ghost up to the viewer
i think its going to take awhile for me to take all of this in there are some dropped plotlines and unanswered questions but im pretty satisfied with it

this is a very traditional horror and a brilliant one at that they did an amazing job the whole way through honestly if it wasnt for the bl which really should not be a factor but in a still largely homophobic world is this could be a mainstream horror gem even with the bl this could easily become a horror cult classic its absolutely brilliant well told story great actors the right amount of misdirection and intrigue it was great from a horror perspective


in my villain era
this is a very traditional horror
100 agree this was a very horror ending i can think of half a dozen horror media that end with that twist its a very common one the decent popped into my head well the one ending is this a dream or are they dead
as an avid horror fan i liked they kept the tropes it didnt matter it was bl that had no bearing on the plot at all the focus was the story and i was invested

they acted their socks off this episode especially barcode who had to die in some gruesome ways that scene with him in the bathtub jesus
new smoking and smiling with them all passed out around him was probably my favourite scene
anyway i guess non called it i loved it personally perfect horror ending


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
good point they really telegraphed the ending there


oh my god i forgot about this just got chills its like all that happened later was exactly how non scripted it out


just so everyone knows boc did actually issue a trigger warning for blood for once so uhhhh good luck guys


hehim
it was definitely bloody im traumatised

god forbid a horror series to end with a closed ending like we dont have to do the open ending every time for this kind of genrealso i feel like its kinda rushed a bit like half of this ep could have happened in ep 11 and the rest for this one plus some extra scenes to have a more cohesive ending but thats just me


fudanshi
agreed the end pacing felt like the creators wanted to have their big bloodbath episode more than tell a cohesive story


yeah it was like they started the series with horror changed to thriller and created a lot of potentials for cool twistsreveals and then were like psych back to horror

sammon isnt the only one involved theres also the horror writer and i think he was the one more in charge of the present eps than sammon theres a distinct different feeling between the two


bocs cinematography
its not an open ending phee and jin are trapped in purgatoryhell they never left the house

its 100 ambiguous because it just depends on how the viewer wants to interpret it thats how its an open ending



i am gagged by this finale i was ready to throw hands at the time skip because it just felt so abrupt right after all the carnage that happened in the house but that ending really brought me back and im really satisfied by the openendedness of that last scene i dont think this show was ever meant to have a truly happy ending and im glad sammon didnt try to subvert my expectations
the hallucinations between all the guys were so visceral and brutal  all their guilt fear hysteria and anger culminating into those scenes of mass murdermutilation was honestly rough but secretly satisfying to watch if youre squeamish then the last 5 minutes would probably be the only part of the episode without a trigger warning
overall i applaud sammon for bringing this genre into bl and sticking with a nontraditional ending for bl though im sad white had to die  he just wanted to hang out with his bf and his friends and he ended up in the crossfire of a crazy revenge plot instead
either way i look forward to seeing sammons future works and the works of these boc boys as well  theyre all so talented


white didnt even want to come on this dumb dumb trip to the woods with no wifi normalize staying home for a me weekend and surviving



in my villain era
this is it gang we are in the finale
this has far and away been the most popular thread ive hosted thanks for making this a blast its been fun to speculate but all i hope is the finale is wild and we get a twist or two and hopefully some spice
will come back and edit with timstamps for the chickens and perverts 
edit uthebookhuntress upheonixs1518 you absolutely right cannot do timestamps this whole episode is one giant timestamp so ill do trigger warnings
 gore blood suicide drug use sexual assault explicit violent imagery
im alright with the ending that was a very traditional horror ending its not an original horror ending its a pretty common trope that the end wasnt really the end and they were still in it decent truth or dare etc
loved the ride though that first 25ish minutes was everything i want in a horror finale just everything


bocs cinematography
according to what ive been hearing youre gonna be busy with those timestamps lol

naw no way to do timestamps on this shit lol


cause of death the heart killers 
facts just a huge red flag all over
i just read on boc fb profile that next week they will release a pecil episode but i dont know what kind


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
im so glad they let us know lol


in my villain era
i had no idea what it said but i figured it was a warning its a good indicator when to skip ahead


hehim
okay so i just finished watching it and what the actually flip

right like i thought the house was gonna blow up after the lighter sound 
like that is all after all that happened we just leave it up to interpretation 

what the actual flip is right


hehim
the beginning scenes were fucking crazy enjoyed them though but the ending was so bad it ended with a shitty cliffhanger




lmfao white noooooooooo he really did just sign up for a nice little nature retreat with his bf 


what in the actual f did i just watch  this series was so out of my wheelhouse but i liked it and stuck with it i had no idea what to expect and that ending was something i never would have guessed lol
for the record i dont think there is some big white conspiracy he has no back story because he only existed to add to tees story he was young and flirty and tee obviously had a jealous streak so maybe thats what his hallucinations were about that tee thought he cheated even though he didnt but it all just existed so tee could kill the person he loved most
crazy
copper is beautiful and im sad we wont be seeing his face anymore gl to him in england i bet they all had so much fun making this
types olive oil stained broken hip
i dont want to watch it with the news copper is going to study abroad my copperta ship is sinking before it even got started


what is it true oh so sad they had good chemistry


hes going to england for 2 years to finish college so maybe in 2 years hell be back but i wouldnt hold tight to the tacopper ship

kpinhiding



biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
who else yelled what the fuck out loud when the final credits came on the screen
i expected phee  jin to make it tee was a surprise though that i dont understand
butwhite why poor white
eta so maybe none of them made it im so confused lol


im going w none of them making it through because it makes the most sense

unpopular opinion i honestly like the end cuz i was thinking the same thing as phee like their flash forward didnt make any sense cuz like if they had theyd prolly all be in prison or something but i also like the fact that we dont know for sure that the 3 we thought survived actually died which means i can head canon phee getting out alive and ending up after years and years of therapy being happy even tho there is no way that that is what happens but let me be delulu ok idk i feel like its also a good metaphor for trauma and guilt and all that it is however the type of horror that scares me the most not knowing if reality is real and all that so i am now quite certain that i wont be able to sleep for a few days
overall i think it was an insanely well done series and the acting was amazing also i appreciate the constant trigger warning throughout basically the whole episode it definitely needed it
edit also thinking about it new basically got his happy ending the last thing we saw him see was non moving towards the light and being satisfied and grateful for news revenge new never planned to come out of this alive so this was his ideal ending the more i think about the show the more i like the endings for each character except for whites ending although it made sense for tees ending but the whole whites fear being that tee accusing him of cheating rly confused me like i did think at one point that he was probably a sex worker but i feel like they should have developed that more if they wanted that to be canon oh well nothing can be perfect so im satisfied with what we got


i liked it each characters fate felt right for me i didnt like the way it was told bc it felt shoehorned in with phee making a very quick assumptionexposition of their fate but ill take it anybody else an absolute sucker for those do you remember how we got here in the first place or howd we get out of here questions that open up a whole pandoras box of psychologicalthrilling questions for the characters just me then
this was barely a bl for me so i never once pegged any romantic pair as making it out hea or idk alive for that matter


bocs cinematography
i also loved the ending i dont think phee got out but you can head canon that he did there was going to be no happy ending and we all knew it unless you were still trying to put this into the usual bl box even the end game couple seemed like they were happy and then the rug was torn out from under them


i wanna start this off saying that this is a theory for those that want a happy ending this is one of the ways that it could of happened only thing really holding this together is my ba in psychology lol sammon wanted this to be a horror route they even gave off how the ending of this show was going to go when they based their short film off of the blair witch project which is a horror movie with a very ambiguousopen ended ending
trauma really does effect people in different wayswith jin i could see him being just fine after all of that his main thing is his obsession with people first non and now phee as long as phee still agreed to be jins he could get overthrough anything shrugs nothing wouldcould phase him to much as long as he has phee phee has basically become his anchor to reality and stability
phee is a little harder he gets caught up in things quickly and becomes consumed it seems with what he gets caught up with that he seems to push all of his issues down to the back of his brain till he doesnt think about them anymore and then they start popping up out of no where shrugs this is one way i can see the ending happening they got out but with phee not having fully dealt with everything and keep suppressing it all at that time of the lake it kind of all popped up and he got set off cause it was a spot that involved him and non heavily biggest thing with phee i can seetell is that he suppresses almost anythingeverything negative that happens to himaround him instead of dealing with it basically them at that lake triggered phee with a hallucination relapse of everything he suppressed about that outing to stay functional
them not knowing how they got out or anything involving them leaving can be caused by the hallucinogen you can have a short term amnesiamemory lose after how huge of a doseantidote they took back n forth combating all of it and with pors parents really the dad only cared about his image theyd easily be able to cover all that shit up and just move on lol
another way to view this i am not claiming credit for this this is from someone not naming them unless they want to be known who added a theory onto what i just wrote
also if they really are stuck in the cabin but theyre in a delusion where theyre happy and togetherthats not so bad like even seeing non drown himself occasionally was more shocking than devastating either way it could be worse they either left and are ok or theyre stuck but happy together 
adding onto what they wrote i could see phee having those delusions for the rest of his life with how much of the chemicalhallucinogen he ended up inhaling both during the cabin and as new and him were working on it it could of became something that will just always happen on and off his face along with jins werent shocked that he started walking towards the water n phee seeing non was more just startled


both of these theories are perfectly plausible in this universe before the question as to whether or not they left the house at the end in my mind phee was just having normal hallucinations no biggie he can live with that 
and the 2nd theory is pretty much like love for loves sake i completely and wholeheartedly believe they are in that alt universe happy

bocs cinematography
edit i see a lot of comments and people saying its a cliffhanger or will there be a season 2  its actually not a cliffhanger phee and jin didnt get to live a normal lifethey never got out of that house they have to live in purgatory forever or the last moments of their lives phee had to watch non drown himself hes stuck there watching non die over and over again knowing that he couldnt save non or jin
im in fucking agony and i have to go to work after this i knew that we could never get a happy ending but not like this not like this i saw so many vaguetweets about how people hated what people were doing and that the end sucked but i think it ended perfectly for what it was we even got that the end game romance of any other bl was them stuck in purgatory forever everything was so very poetic justice and perfect revenge horror a
 new was never coming out of this alive this was always an extended suicide for him hes no longer new  hes full jonathan crane that opening shot of him dancing with the gas could fit straight into a batman comic even if phee hadnt shot him how was he supposed to go back to regular society after this he was on the path of no return hed killed two innocent people when it had the flashes of deng and white i was just overcome with a swell of emotion he gets to be with his family again he got what he wanted revenge at the cost of everything
 jesus fucking christ tee again i knew that there wouldnt be a happy ending but not like this all his actions led to this moment he ruined nons life even if he didnt mean to just like he finally found happiness but he still destroyed it with his own hands even if he didnt mean to jjay fucking killed it i really want to see him in more stuff post haste i felt my stomach roiling when it had the cuts between tee and whites hallucinations because of the mounting dread of the tragedy we were barrelling towards
 fluke losing his eyes that he used to see anything but didnt do anything against
 top in the circle of judgement of his friends how they were just looking at him like he was some moron
 jin stabbing and stabbing his fapping hand for a lack of better term that was the hand he used to film non and keng that was the hand he used to masturbate to non in the flashes we saw he wanted non for himself and his jealousy led him to the video
 phee stuck in purgatoryhell watching non die over and over again because while he tried to find out the truth he was never able to find non and save him and he wound up getting to comfortable in a life that was a lie he got too comfortable with jin and now hes trapped there with him forever or the last moments they are alive that are stretched out to an eternity psychically
edit 2 there is a chance that tee phee and jin survived but they wouldnt be normal pors dad or one of their men would eventually come to the house to find them after not hearing anything for a while and find the scene tee would still be in the throes of mania like we saw in his bedroom in the fake future phee is stuck in a loop of seeing non die over and over again and jin could be alive but if hes still stabbing himself would probably die of blood loss even if they did survive pors dad would make sure they went to prison so even if they do survive there is no happiness here


im dying at the jin stabbing his fapping hand for the lack of better term 


rwrb ofc bmftms
flukes end was truly poetic justice he witnessed the two key moments that sealed nons fate but he preferred to ignore them even though deep down he knew of the consequences of neutrality 
from newtan i loved that while the others were tormented by non he found peace and he was able to reconcile in his own way with his brother and receive his gratitude for a moment i feared that they decided to make nons ghost reproach him for his revenge and new died regretful

i think the ending is just intended to be ambiguous so that viewers can take what they want from it if a viewer wants to believe that the boys escaped but non will always be haunting them and tee is miserable then they can if a viewer wants to believe they all died there they can if a viewer wants to believe theyre still hallucinating but could escape they can
though i will say i dont know that phee and jin would go to prison because they didnt actually do anything but again thats up to interpretation which i love about this ending people can make of it what they want


bocs cinematography
the crime scene is such a mess and everyone was high out of their minds that a prosecutor could easily get charges dropped or lessened they would probably get charged with a lesser crime like assault but i think a murder charge would be hard to prove in a court of law in this case


rwrb ofc bmftms
i wonder if the cameras they hid are still recording since the original purpose was to have proof of the confession they wanted to obtain


i immediately came here when i finished it question is there a season 2 planned or something or like a special episode cause thats the feels i got im 
otherwise i liked it i didnt  it but i wanted some bloody carnage and i got nobody got a happy ending which im fine with
dont come for me with this one but i didnt feel a thing when white diedi just got detached from his character when we launched into the flashbacks it sucks though cause i loved him and fluke episode14 the separation didnt make my heart grow fonder unfortunately sorry
my eyes were rolling big time in the last 10mins in fact i was yelling dont do this show but im glad they flipped it it was shoehorned for sure but i wasnt going to be ok with pheejin living happily ever after while tees sufferinggone fruit loops phee will forever hallucinate about non as he should i him but its right for his character and theyre all forever stuck there either living or dead it feels right to me ya know plus they ask the ultimate question imho who sufferssuffered more the living or the dead id rather die personally
news ending was the bestworst for me mio rocked everything like a frickin boss and you could tell he was having a good time a big part of me wanted him to have his vengeance but i knew he and non his parents was going to be a tragic figure in all this 

oh also copperjin is going overseas to continue uni so he wont be around to do a second season


cause of death the heart killers 
hes leaving at the end of the year right theres still time to squeeze in something but i doubt it will be s2 or a special episode i kinda dig that sammon went all the way horror here no need of hea how could there after that bloodbath those who remain might need therapy for life


bocs cinematography
ahhhhhhhhhhh
we will finally know which theories are correct me and my friend keep thinking that its going to end just like the short movie ended  with jin being the only one left it looks like were going to go right into the plot of the short film in this episode where each person sees the masked figure but the figure is different for each of them which is true because they are all hallucinating something different

i am so overwhelmed i really hope they got all the boys therapy after this especially for barcode

i really liked that ending especially the way what we learned about everybody throughout the past few episodes starting ep 5 really came to really haunt them in their last moments like i love that fluke who was constantly witnessing things top breaking the camera jin taking the video but never speaking up about them gouged his own eyes out loved tans visions as well to him he was finally a good phi who took care of his nong i was expecting tee to die but the fact that he killed white omg my mouth was agape that whole sequence
the very very end was im choosing to believe this was just like 2 minutes after the massacre not 2 years and theyre all currently dying in that courtyard and phees hallucinating still just an extension of seeing non die in a million ways and he doesnt necessarily even have to have the drug to hallucinate it could be just from the trauma of everything going on


i am confused  spoiler
did white really die or is that the drug influence thingy and they are all just sleeping um i dont know

id say that everyone we saw from the outside perspective the scene where they pan around the room is confirmed dead so yes while anything that focused on one characters perspective like the flash forward is up in the air on whether it was reality or not
thats just my interpretation based on like cinematography story telling stuff ive learned about tho 

it seems some people were confused by the ending the twist is that nobody actually made it out of the house phee and jin were hallucinating maybe they eventually escaped but well never know 

in the end i was hoping non would somehow be alive maybe due to interference by perths character nope perths character didnt really have a purpose to the narrative after all i was also hoping tee would attempt to redeem himself by either killing his uncle or sacrificing himself to protect white white was really the only character i particularly wanted to make it out alive but i would have been okay with a few others living depending on the circumstances
the everybody dies ending would also have been fine but i hated the fake out two years later bit that tonally clashed with the rest of the episode i definitely didnt want phee and jin to end up happily ever after so im glad that wasnt real but the reveal was just kinda dumb sammon loves her last minute audience manipulation tan and bun shooting eachother and falling off a cliff in mod triage pretending like its going to have a sad ending until the last possible minute leaving barely any time for the audience to enjoy the main couple being together and it never quite works for me

types olive oil stained broken hip
this finale was terrible i dont mean badi mean this definition extremely unpleasant they brought the horror angle full circle and its not my bag of chips but gd if they did not do an amazing job with this show i like sammons scripts and i became a fan of more than one of these actors
all that being said
what the flucking fluck was that ending are you kidding me

dear friends this has been a pleasure  see you on the other side

im so sad poor innocent white got dragged into this and ultimately lost his life at the hands of his lover  rip white i feel that ending left doors open for a possible second season but with the news that copper is going abroad a second season wouldnt be the same without him  overall dff is definitely one of my favourite bl shows all the casting was perfect and the acting was superb 



idk what i was expecting but anyway the ending is so disappointing unless they all are doomed which i believe they are bec i went back and saw the episode again and it looks like none of them actually survived 
edit  they all are dead friends forever 

overall not a bad ending i wanted all dead basically well beside white which is sad and the most shocking scene for me
for all those jin supporters out there that forgave jin for filming non now you can get confirmation that jin indeed posted that video
new feeling guilty for that uncle and whites death was a nice touch non was a good kid too once like white he wasnr spare so why should white
i really enjoyed this show it was intriguing and thinking about different theories was fun
i have to give them a for these kids acting


it was a good finale it felt like a cop out a little with how open ended it was but still a great experience overall i had a lot of fun with it and the cast and crew have a lot to be proud of
i like to believe they all died lol so new baby im proud of you you did it hes a little guilty for the innocent people dying which is fair but im so glad they didnt make him feel remorse about any of those other jerks i wish he got a hug from ghost non but ill take the thank you
white sweetie im so sorry you deserved to be canon confirmed final girl sad that white wasnt on the fantasy revenge twink team of perth and non that i had envisioned in my head he kind of just existed to be tees character growth manic pixie dream boy plot device alas but tees subconscious drug state equating white with non fed into my teenon ghost ship so that was fun for me lol
the way i was furious at the two year time skip and seething as jin was like thanks for forgiving me lets move on  like bro lmao jins guilt is so minimal compared to everyone elses even though hes argueably caused non the worst trauma of all of them minus tee fluke stabbed his own eyes out just because he was a passive observer all jin did was stab his hand and then live happily ever after and decide things are fine now i was so mad lol then the last few lines happened and i was like ok ok i can live with this
they really wrote themselves into the wall with jin pheejin is a massively unappealing ship imo and its part because even until the end jin didnt take stock of his sins the way the other characters were forced to do even his sex tape hallucination felt centered on himself not non and his hand stabbing was nothing compared to what all the other people in the friendgroup inflicted on themselves so his comeuppance was wholly unsatisfying until the very end for me plus he still got the guy in his dead person ghost hallucinationfantasy high so it was very vomit emoji for me the writers should have never confirmed that jin was the one who posted the sex tape if they wanted the audience to root for himlike him and then if they didnt want the audience to root for himlike him they should have committed to showcasing his narrative punishment further than they did because it really felt neuteredflat compared to everyone else
im choosing to believe theyre all dead except white who somehow hobbled out idk im gonna miss a lot of these actors so im eager for more from them and i also appreciate boc taking on a risky standard defying genre of bl though i still wish they committed to the journey a lil more than they did great show i enjoyed so much of it and ill probably give it an 85 maybe a 9 on mdl
oh also major shoutout to barcode he impressed me so so much in this role and especially this ep hes mvp of this show and then probably jjay for me another great performance


i was so mad lol then the last few lines happened and i was like ok ok i can live with this
haha same

argh im so torn

i loved this finale this show started episode one by paying homage to slashers and ended in true slasher fashion
in the end non got his revenge at least the revenge the audience and new wanted to see


as a horror fan i absolutely loved the endingbut im confused as to whether tee guy is alive but he became mentally unstable abnormal after that traumatizing event but all the others died 100  i loved it still i needed closure for non did he die of suicide or illness i dont know i fast forwarded through the ep but still did not find more about him anyways kudos to the writers i loved it absolutely 

yall i waited until tonight to watch both eps 11  12 bc i didnt want any cliffhanger but like wtf just happened in ep 12
where did the plot go why did poor bb white have to die instead of tee he didnt even know non 
did they all die what was that ending scene even what happened to keng how did non actually die and when did tees uncle get exposed what about tees sick dad
im so damn confused and that was just it not a satisfying ending at all  

its interesting some people say the ending is amazing some people say its not overall we all enjoyed the journey and i think we all would agree to more bls with horror as the main topic cheers to the series ending

think its cause the last scene cut off too abruptly and as someone who hates open ended and vague things with a burning passion i get them but im not as annoyed this time cause i expected something like this considering there was one episode left and so much to cover i just convinced myself that the ending meant they all died or at least jin and phee didnt get the happy ending they absolutely didnt deserve and are either dead or in a mental institute having hallucinations for the rest of their miserable lives 

i just wanna say i love the ending its everything i wanted from it yes its a classic horror ending but i didnt think they would go there and they did



cause of death the heart killers 
woah props to sammon for sticking to the premise and not bending to the bl rules this ended as it should with lots of gore deaths and no hea we can delulu ourselves but we are stuck in that valley house forever
when i checked the running time i knew we were not having happy
so a couple fo things i need to discuss
did white cheat on tee during those 2 years i think so he wouldnt be hallucinating venereal diseasess boils if he hadnt did he cheat on tee with phee mmm thats more tricky but it felt like they were hinting that right
was jin another victim of keng i think the theories about this are true he was double pissed when he found out about non and keng i dont think a crush on non deserved that reaction but watching your exlover having sex with your current crush might be it
did jin post the video then i was finally on team jin didnt do it because of the light and dark mode of the computers but then it seemed they doubled down on jin being the culprit and that was it this felt not satisfying to me
im salty about white he really was an innocent bystander and wasnt meant to survive now tees outcome the best revenge ngl


bocs cinematography
i dont think jin was a victim of keng i think that was just part of seeing himself as being filmed and thus he was put in nons position i think that the fact that we saw how much jin masturbated thinking of non that he really was jealous and hurt because hed built up such a fantasy of non that he did post the video as pure reaction
tees outcome is the coldest revenge dish ever jjay did so fucking well that i am ruined

jin definitely posted the video and him seeing himself instead of non with keng in my opinion was just him imagining what if he was in nons place being filmed


cause of death the heart killers 
the light and dark mode were misleading i hadnt even noticed at first and then i went down the tumblr rabbit hole and they convinced me i see your point about jin and keng i still believe he went just a tad bit overboard with his reaction but that also explains this kid had these friends for a reason too

i can answer 3 jin def posted the video we see the uploading bar go up to 100 with his mouse hovering over the tweetpublish button then he throws his beer and his computer sends out sparks so we can only really guess if the computer going out like it did made the confirm click that can happen or just straight up died but then we get to the school and the look on jins face when the other kids are watching then looking at them plus the way he shuts down fluke when he tries to speak about it hints heavily that it def happened through his tweet xx
gonna throw out my own ideas for the other questions 
white def cheated on tee or he was a prostitute during those 2 years i cant really think of any other way for his fear of stds to be the biggest thing he fears over all others xx tho him cheating with phee  i cant see that one  my take of phee is that he just got to comfy with jin and ended up falling in love with jin while doing this long con i cant see myself phee sleeping with white during all of this
on jin i think his love of non was more of a complete obsession with him so when he say something he thinks he ownsis his sleeping with someone else he kinda lost it honestly all these damn kids seems to have some mental instability


bocs cinematography
yeah jin was totally obsessed with non the way he jerked off to him constantly and look at the way that he was completely besotted with phee instantly jins a character that latches onto boys so when he saw non with keng he got super jealous like non was cheating on him because when youre obsessed with someone you have scenarios in your head that arent even real

about white death my take is non was innocent too and he wasnt spare so why would white be spare


cause of death the heart killers 
following news logic i get it and it was poetic justice that tee took the person who new loved the most so new took the one tees love the most


 the behind the scenes are hilarious 
anyways i was about to go off that tee survived somehow although he is basically the reason non is dead but looks like everyone is deaddrugged still  lovely well done new well done 
ah yeah big fan of bullies dieing so 

cant wait i want death


when will the new episode come out


14 min in and omg omg omggggggg

i dont really like the ending  i know i know it was never going to be a happy ending but why tf not why couldnt the good people have a good ending phee was good white was good this sucks


in my villain era
it was a very horror ending i was hoping white was the final girl but tbh im low key happy they didnt cop out with the happy endingbut thats the horror fan in me talking not the bl one 


pakin girlie 
i only watched bits and pieces mostly the nc scenes and tbh im glad a lot of commenters here seem happy with the ending but im in bl for the romance and this seems horrible to me

cause of death the heart killers 
ooh we are back on horror territory 

we really are the ending was classic horror leading the audience to think some of them survived only for it to crumble apart at the very last second

even with the antidote smoked by pheeall of them still perished in that villaall of them in their own drug induced hazea fitting revenge for nontheir dff


in my villain era
beulah your comment reads like poem i love it


24 min in and if phee and jin survive i will be mad


bocs cinematography
i dont believe they did
hi i havent been on air in a minute but wow my jaw is on the floor i am baffled perplexed content sad apathetic angry etc etc with all that happened this outcome makes the most sense i like that theres no neat and tidy end because that wasnt the show it was messy and messed with your mind and the truth was always out of reach i think white was the only shrapnel here but even then the boils must have meant something more than we know this was my first 1010 show on mdl jj needs his own series immediately he has so much potential and carried so well just wow this one is gonna stick with me

captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
i really hope the cast especially barcode had access to mental health services it must have taken a psychological toll on all of them to act out the scenes of this last episode i honestly cant imagine having to act scene after scene after scene of suicide attempts


im sure the show isnt as traumatic as what is portrayed for us to watch as it behind the scenes


i just now wonder who is the person lightning the cigarets in the end like was all that phee had started to see just hallucination to the very end or really tan died and after that he fall again to hve vision of non i doubt that tan scene with non would be just hallucination because it was very emotionl to viewers so who was it tan non phee or just a director hint that the cigarets phee smoked one after another were not a actuall antidox but just different drugs which trap him there 

listenim only on episode 7 lol my bff and i have a watch party every sunday where we watch 3 episodes after work so i have 2 weekends to go before i get to watch episode 12 sooooo im trying not to read the comment thread about to happen herebut why im here already  


okay the hell is that ending should of just left it at phree n jin at the lake without that extra shit at the end 
edit 
like if they stopped it right there the ending would of been kinda good itd of closed things out wed of known what happened to phree jin and tee the 3 we think survived but then they just had to add that bullshit at the end and ruin it vv man


bocs cinematography
the ending is perfect they didnt leave the house there was no normal life phee didnt get to escape seeing non die over and over again they all died new got his revenge for non tee may be still alive but hes so broken that hes exactly as we saw him just on the floor of that house instead of in his actual room phee and jin are trapped in the hell they made

cause of death the heart killers 
cant relate two years was just too little time for phee and jin to bounce back up after what they went through especially jin i was kinda expecting to see his hand at some point he went hard stabbing it with the scissors but there was nothing that seemed sus to me ngl the 2 years after was misleading and was unnecessary of they were gonna bring us back to square 1 or in this case the freaking valley house




ok so here after watching ep 12 all i can say is that the series has successfully come out wid the most unique way of ending it and none of the theories made so far are correct or are they 
i dont wanna spoil i want everyone to watch and leave their thoughts abt the ending
edit i think the ending hints towards everyone eventually being dead inside of that house but if u think abt it another way it culd also be a possibility that none of this is actually happening since the beginning of the show everyone was drugged and theres a high possibility that they r all stuck wid what has been happening in their hallucinations the only part we can actually confirm is true is the fact that these grp of boys have hurt non in some way or other every single one of them has except white we will never know which part was real and which ones are hallucinations because theyve been drugged since the beginning of ep 1 imo the show is a cluster of everyones hallucinations which eventually leads us to the story of non



ok 33 min and im mad lets see if i change my feeling by the ending edit i did change my feeling im happy now


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i am still processing that finale and this series as a whole but it did just become my 100th mydramalist entry on my completed series list
i think i need more hobbies


now i know why they deleted por scene about 9 people being in the cottage o guess there was non


pakin girlie 
i only watched bits and pieces ok the kisses and nc scenes heh and after reading here im very glad i dont think i would qualify this series as bl at all and it definitely doesnt seem like my jam 


in my villain era
it leans harder into the horror than the bl

i had so many questions and none of them were answered wtf i loved it tho


ummm sooo my life is in shambles and im absolutely flabbergasted that they killed off the one innocent little boy hhhhhhhhh
idek how to feel about the ending i would hope we get something more to feel more complete about the ending cause wtf i also wish that phee and jin wouldve ended up together together cause they were perfect for each other
im so surprised that just about everyone died if this is traditional horror i must not watch enough lmao
anyway this show was amazing if my emotions are this affected by it then it was definitely an amazing show 1410


um im so confused but ok a lil disappointed


just watched this i loved the ending actually definitely a departure from the standard bl format which is so awesome i feel like they really pushed the envelope with this one and it was great

that ending left me speechless im so satisfied and dissatisfied at the same time i loved what happened with top and fluke jin got off lightly poor white tho i think we really needed one more episode for all of it to wrap up i still have so many questions  btw did anyone notice how at news last moments when he hallucinated non non was wearing his red bracelet was that a mistake on their part wasnt the last time they talked that scene outside their house i went back and checked and non didnt have his bracelet then im not even sure he was talking to phee at that time so why would new hallucinate that bracelet im kinda obsessed with that thing cause non had it even when he died and that fact haunts me aside from that i feel so bad for how non died thinking no one cared being worked to death and beaten up and how even his body was just towed off


i i will i will talk about my opinion on last ep but i need to heal first



finished everything in two days pheww what a ride if youre looking for typical bl then this was not it it was a horror thriller series with gay characters
i like the ending you can interpret it however you want it could be literally anything and theres no way to confirm what was real or what was not one of the most interesting theory was that all of them might really just still hallucinating new clearly didnt trust phee so he might drugged phee from the start as well and he keeps on smoking that stuff around them so they just passed out and falls deep into their hallucinations trapped inside their worst fears with no way out everything that happened after that was really just some sort of massive layered intertwined hallucinations and even if they got save theres no way they could live normally personally i thought it was worst than death or everything happened exactly like new wanted it to be he has nothing to lose after his parents death so might as well go all out with the revenge poor phee unknowingly got caught up in news revenge plot while all he wanted was to know the truth
ive seen a lot of comments hating on phee sure he was wrong for pushing non but from his pov he saw the video and this was after he confronting non about his relationship with the teacher anyone would be pissed he was hurting so he hurt non with his wordsactions it was wrong yes in the ideal world he would ask and wait for explanation but they were just some 17yo boys whod didnt think stuff through he managed to calm down and willing to talk to non albeit too late theres no way he couldve known that this leads to nons breaking point i mean non did hide things from him he even told him to ditch the group of course im in no way blaming non his family situation wasnt exactly ideal and his so called friends and his tutor took advantage of him he was thrown in this shtty situation thus he makes some questionable decisions the whole situation was sad really
everyone had their shares leading non to his ending especially his group of so called friends if anything i was dissatisfied with the lack of phees reaction to jins confession like shouldnt hed be more idk angry disappointed not to mentioned he really hallucinated about being together with jin after all that bruhhh  but i guess it kinda shows that he really just wanted some closure about non and moved on with his life jin pretending to be morally upright compared to his friends pissed me off when in reality he is just like them and he showed lack of remorse too
if you think about it new was so determined to end it all he probably didnt bring the antidote let alone his inhaler he also might lied to phee so while phee gained conscious he might inhaled more of the drug thinking it was the antidote so from that point onwards theres no way to know which was real did he passed out did he shoot new did he managed to save jin and tee but even if he did he unknowingly drug them again so the hallucinations continues all we know from the ending he actually realized that everything was in his head he seems to have high tolerance towards the drugs so he is most definitely alive and was still at the house and there also the sound of the lighter and someones smoking so im assuming that was new probably high from the drugs id love to have more conclusive ending but cant say i dont like this ending it has this eerie unsettling vibe which match the series
i was actually surprised with the explicit sexual scene it was hot but unnecessary i think also it was super triggering so please watch with caution i thought shadow was hard enough but this series was even more
overall while it was not perfect but as a horror triller fan i thought it was pretty good i would also like to applaud barcode because he nailed his role especially when he goes all psychotic chills i always thought he was one of the weakest actors in kpts but he improved a lot here appreciate boc for producing this kind of series i hope we can get more of this


um thank you phee still remained my favorite even when i was disappointed the friends comments he made in epi 10 12 irked me with him but i didnt have the patience to type it
i still feel hes the one character i could justifydefend the easiest of the bad guys

i also finished this in 2 days and tears are fogging my eyes whilst i am writing this i am so traumatised


i just finished watching dff just now and i was just crying the whole episode the ending was really unique i just felt like my heart just shattered like the actors all did a great job in making me cry i am sorry to white i thought he was involved with non but no he was innocent but it makes sense his name literally symbolises purity but anyways i am still in tears because of how tan or new didnt deserve to die like that the cigarret that had an x on it that tan said that had the extracts was the actually the one that didnt have the x on it tan lied to phee about that fact which explains why him jin and tee are still stuck at the house


omg yes i was right


the flashbacks at 31mins just before the time skip was soulcrushing very aptly soundtracked by jon bjrk  before its gone 


as a horror fan i love it loved the ending barcode really nailed his role his evilish smile was spooky and i loved it all the gore blood was perfect it had an open ending too and i also heard there will be special episode i hope its not behind the scenes but more about nonwhitenew perspective i might sound crazy but new really is a kind brother i wish i had a brother like him


barcode really nailed his role his evilish smile was spooky and i loved it
yassssss his almost laughingalmost crying face was amazing  he must have worked ridiculously hard to find that balance

so the ending was gory and i think the best outcome that nobody got an happy end
but in the end the story did not feel that strong
i get the sense that they already started filming while the ending was not clear yet and leaving it open if there was a 9th person there and if that was non there are still a lot of plotholes unclear
newtan btw was amazing his performance and even the end hallucination were done great up until the end he was convinced what he did was right and no torturing and killing is never ok as it also included innocent bystanders
white sole purpose of being the liberation for tee and then becoming is own personal hell was so good
but jin i had so much hope for this character it does feel like they did not known what to do with him they should have made him darker and have that at least be known to phee him filming and posting non seemed like an actual of impuls based on revenge and hurt which afterwards he felt guilty about this suggest specially his age and the rest of his behavior as more of a really stupid act then him being super bad so why would his hallucination be about him being filmed specially they way they did it to me that did not make sense and then he starts stabbing his own hand why what was the link with his hallucinations if he was going to stab something i would have chosen another body part
oh and if his biggest fear is for his sex acts to be caught on camera why have sex in front of your window or give a bj on a balcony in a house that you know had cameras


i went in nearly blind didnt expect any bl because the horror thriller elements were advertised to me the most i loved it all the way through
i was consistently excited for the next episodes and mind fucked by the ending im sad i finished it so quickly


the ending reminded me of the movie incident in the ghostland where 2 sisters are trapped and tortured for many years and one sister dreams of getting out and having this whole new life as an successful author for 16 years while still being trapped in the house and the sister brings her back to reality and they escape the house if thats the route they are taking then we can expect a season 2 soon where they they try to escape the house


honestly wanted a nicer ending for white

im extremely late but i dropped dff around halfway through ep 4 as it was airing im glad i picked it up again because the flashback episodes were amazing and really caught my interest aside from phee and white i was pretty ok with everyone else dying though

i cant believe the ending was this bad like there was so much potential ruined 


whaaat two years later tell me its them hallucinating


100 nobody got out of that house alive
