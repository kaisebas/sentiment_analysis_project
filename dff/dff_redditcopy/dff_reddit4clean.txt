horror tropes were tropeing but i liked it fluke is so paranoid and had a full psychotic break hes dead meat soon 
it seems like non may have been killed as a sacrifice by his friends to grant their wishes they said something about that in the beginning 


cause of death the heart killers 
fluke is so paranoid and had a full psychotic break hes dead meat soon 
for half a second i was feeling for him when he was explaining about the video and the impact on his career but then he went back to being stupid and threatening baby white and i just cant have it


bocs cinematography
man the episodes feel so short i am engrossed
 who is mr keng was that body bag of dry leaves an effigy of him
 fluke you fucking moron there is always that one horror trope character that isnt the killer but it so selfish and paranoid that they just ruin everything for everyone else
 white and phee best boys poor white was so scared i love that phee is the calm one but still caring about jin i want to know their backstory and even though there is something off with tee i actually really like him as a character i cant wait to see his backstory more and him immediately throwing himself in front of white to shield him  i said it last week and ill say it again that tee and white have such a good casual intimacy about them

and him immediately throwing himself in front of white to shield him  i said it last week and ill say it again that tee and white have such a good casual intimacy about them
ill give him that but foes he really deserve white though


oh almost definitely not but despite being a controlling dck he does genuinely seem to care for white


bocs cinematography
we dont know  im sure hes done some shit but maybe whites not as innocent as he seems


cause of death the heart killers 
white is best boy and im dying on that hill like he can kill someone and ill think they deserved it


tee literally tried to leave once already white deserves better


cause of death the heart killers 
im gonna say that he was freaking out at the time and when he got his senses back he went back for him bit im starting to feel like no one would be enough for our precious baby white

i agree so much literally in this episode baby white and phee are my top fav like at first i thought phee was a horn dog but apparently his also someone good to have in a horror situation also wtf baby white was almost left alone his bf almost left him like damn i felt so bad for white his so innocent isnt if he dies before the finale i swear their will be hell to pay

im so fascinated with this show and really like how its keeping me guessing as to whether theres supernatural involvement or not like even now im still a bit sus as to just whats going on
cant wait for the flashback scenes to come i want to know what went down i want to see jin and phees past in particular because i have no idea what happened between them i want to know what tee did and whether he deserves my baby white


cause of death the heart killers 
i want to know what tee did and whether he deserves my baby white
this 100


bocs cinematography
i havent had a chance to watch yet i cant wait though  im fucking loving this show but one thing that is sticking in the back of my mind is from the first episode where tee said to white you promised to be obedient if you came or something along those lines either tee is mad controlling or possessive or theres something more to white that we havent seen yet because its not like white is a terror who is flirting with everyone and is hard to control  so unless tee is a complete bastard which he may be it just struck me as something odd to say

tee seems like an asshole so id bet on him being controlling and possessive 


in my villain era
im low key thinking tee has a thing and he and naut had a thing


bocs cinematography
hmmm interesting tee is definitely not a squeaky clean character i still like him though  im intrigued as to what his past is so that would be interesting


cause of death the heart killers 
wait whos naut


in my villain era
sorry non not naut barcodes character we havent met yet


cause of death the heart killers 
no worries im always so bad with names that i get anxious when im missing someone


in my villain era
was trying to think where the name naut came from then i realized it was one of the playboyy charicters 


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant keep those straight too many characters in so many shows i cant


in my villain era
no sexy time this week whole lot of horror tropes and screaming
white continues to be my favorite character and honestly the actor is the strongest so far this whole episode was mainly fluke having a meltdown and yelling the standard sanity slippage trope i would have honestly thought it would have been tee and not fluke and i was surprised with the mask reveal not who i was thinking well done poor por guys been dying for 4 episodes
white calling out fluke mid rant was actually fantastic shouldnt you use a clean needle and thread
looks like next week were finally going to find out what happened to not
timestamps
600  jump scare 
1400  gory sews up por 
2740  gory top pulls out the stick holding por together 


there are so many layers to that story
non
keng
and all these past relationships we know nothing about 
also yeah i just love fuaiz i also think jjay plays really well his character is despicable but the good kind of despicable very egoistical and dark
and we still dont know what is real what is hallucination what is possession what is just craziness
very interesting

man i cant get enough of this show i cant wait until next week honestly these eps need to come out faster  it looks like were finally gonna get a bit of a backstory and context im excited to see their relationship with non esp jin cuz the ep preview looked sus as hell with that whole thigh caress 
and they better give me more pheejin in the next ep 


im a little disappointed about the guilty party being a spirit or some kind of possesion i hope they explain that top was poisoned or drugged
fluke is probably innocent but so stupid and paranoid that he fd everything telling the rescue team not to come to them
por is gone and top probably too fluke is at the deep end and probably will be ended up soon by tee or even by white i still insist that he is no so innocent and weak as he seems
we got just two scenes of jin and phee but were very cute i wonder why they fell out
finally in the preview we watch what happened one year ago jin and non seemed more than friends or at least jin was interested in him i still say that jin has something to do with everything


cause of death the heart killers 
im so invested in whites survival im about to throw chanclas at my screen whenever topfluke appear and the jury is still out about tee tbh
is there something wrong with me because i was bummed there were no spicy shenanigans happening inside that coffin phi was cute to jin though hes getting those brownie points not to get bitten next time
so excited for next week because well see what the whole thing was about but i will be missing white and phi non looks cute though


fluke really went down the spiral this episode and his paranoia and obsession with keeping his profile clean to protect his future prospects was so believable and relatable to me because i was damn paranoid and sensitive during my final year in uni too and it was stressful af to protect my grades and making sure everything was fine
top really upped the scary and creepy factor to me  im so damn happy im not alone tonight
also them crying during that scene was just great acting because it looked natural to me who went into the drama not expecting to be amazed as most really didnt have any stellar works to look at
someone protect white the little baby 
barcode finally showing next week screaming  someone take off those sus hands away from him im watching your every move jin 
why cant we get two episodes at least per week i need answers and one ep isnt enough 



when the masked villian removed his maskwas that top or nonbarcode i couldnt tell oppsie it is top i looked at the shoes so top is part of a revenge plot conspiracy with whom non at this point everyone is guilty and complicit in what they did to non
fluke wanna be doctor was so unhinged super paranoid he is definitelygoing cray cray por rip
flashbacks with barcode at last looking forward for more horrific developments


the masked villian was top if you look back at the ground youll see his white and black adidas and his white pants with the black line down the sides
also im super excited to see the flashbacks with barcode to i really wonder what happened
i think por had the idea to use jin against non so he could win the film contest he wanted non to write the script so maybe the only way it would happen is if jin convinced him to thats my theory but also i think maybe jin started to get feelings for non idk
another thing i think the whole reason tee and top think non is dead is because of what we saw when top was having a seizure someone was going after top i think non and then non on the ground my other theory is that non got to into the film and character and they got scared and hit him after they hit him its possible he stopped breathing for bit so they thought he died 
maybe they left him there thats why fluke said to white who would want to watch the video of a friend disappearing
but right now i still dont know what to think


fujoshi
with top puking up sludge like that i assume he iswas possessed im not sure if hes been the masked murderer this whole time or just since last episode watching week to week quite frankly i dont remember when he got separated from the rest of the group 


i think there are two of them like in scream last episode when tee and top were fleeing using the motorbike after that decapitation the masked killer threw an ax at them thats why they fell and got separated


hope everything makes sense and dumb doctor only few will survive now i guess next week preview seems promising and finally flashback ep with barcode  for next week
