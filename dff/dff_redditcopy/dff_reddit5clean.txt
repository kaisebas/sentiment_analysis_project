theres so much more depth here than some people are picking up on imo none of the characters are really being presented as purely innocent or bad i think and i believe that the ones who seem one or the other are going to develop more depth as we go along
por  is a spoiled rich baby but also seems desperate for the approval of his parents or at least of his father his father also seems to be abusive from the clip we saw of next week
tee  i have to go back to pay closer attention to the dialogue but it seems like his father is possibly sick hes beholden to his uncle who is using him for his own benefit by getting him involved in the money laundering we know that his uncle ends up in legal trouble later on what happened
fluke  doesnt seem to be directly involved but keeps getting dragged into his friends messes this happens in the earlier eps too  he hasnt done anything but he keeps getting affected and we can see the mental toll its taken
top  hes actually one of the characters we know the least about and im curious to learn more hes obviously very self serving though and willing to let non take the fall for him
im curious about some dynamics here
tee and non  well actually non and all of them except jin why do they dislike him so much it seemed to go beyond just bullying i wonder if non did something in the past had a breakdown or something and thats why they have this dislike of him
keng and non  non did not look comfortable when the teacher offered him the ride is he the heart emoji in nons phone what happened to keng since he seems to have ended up dead
new  who is he the obvious link that seems to be staring us in the face is pheephi and nonnong but is that the case
tan and white  how do they play into this particularly tan white is tees partner but is he as innocent as he seems or is there more than meets the eye why has tan been asking so many questions
tee and white  how did the two of them connect and fall in love the two of them actually fascinate me
perth the actor  whenhow will he get involved
and lastly phee and jin whats phees history how did he and jin end up together whats jins story beneath him protecting non etc how did he become friends with the others or is it just a matter of not realizing what they were like the difference in his character is obvious in the flashback hes become much harder unhappier imo
so many questions im loving it i cant wait until next week


you are so on point with your analysis 
this mixed with what we had in the trailer really make me wonder specifically for teewhite it seems like white pursued tee more than the contrary also they are part of the  university  crew for which again only in trailers and sneak peek with phee jin white tee and por the tangle is deep

i think white is really the clueless guy hes the final boy  poor him tho i wouldnt want to date a guy like tee 


honestly after analysis of other trailers white cant be that much of a clueless boy for me thats more tan
white is seen fighting with jin in a trailer i think it is him he is part of the university team to which stuff seems to happen whether they are just acting for jin or something truly happens is yet to be seen but there is like a whole preview on that specific period i also think i saw him being traumatised in one scene and there is this whole entanglement with tee which is more than just a passing romance they have a lot of scenes together
there is also this strange scene where jin is filming himself in a mirror and the picture glitches and white suddenly appears next to him 
i dont know what to do of this but that does not scream innocent final boy that will simply make it through


im inclined to agree the general reaction to white makes him come across as an audience surrogate channeling last survivor in a horror movie vibes however one of the fundamentals of the horror genre is that everything is not as it seems at first glance friendly faces might be enemies and monsters could have been the victims of tragic circumstances so i wouldnt be surprised if he turns out to be not as innocent as initially portrayed


imo none of them are innocent maybe with the exception of non at the start they all hide something and have all or will all do something nefarious it seems like the serie is good like that
they will all have reasons and circumstances ok maybe some will just be nefarious but i dont believe any of them to be pure good i am really looking forward to knowing more 

hmmm i think dating someone like tee is kinda weird if youre good  who knows i hope hes evil too

isnt it obvious that tee is hiding things from him white doesnt fully know his partner its probably going to be devastating for him when he finds out the truth 

which trailer are you watching there seems to be one that may be unrelated or just thematic to the show thats the shorter one that boc released first it doesnt seem to fit at all with what weve seen so far in the show


there were three videos i recently analysed in a post on thaibl first the prerelease video the sneakpeek and the official trailer


oof this episode was hard to watch poor non  this friend group consists of only assholes and their followers apart from jin why is he even friends with these guys they are the worst

maybe jin has a secret too


he certainly does one does not get splattered with blood smiling like he did in the trailer


cause of death the heart killers 
ok the jury is out tee sucks and he doesnt deserve white like i get that everyone has their issues that make them do what they do but in the present tee doesnt seem to be repentant just regretful i really really hate top liars and people that cant accept their wrongdoings just make my blood boil on the other hand i can see where por is coming from maybe because i know he just died in the present now how did fluke get involved in all this mess
one thing for sure i cant blame the guys for not knowing the answer to the calculus problem that teacher he would make me stupid for sure
barcode is killing it as non though hes giving innocent but in the brink of losing his mind really well if this ends up being paranormal i cant blame him for going off from the afterlife  teamnon tbh

jokes on you im into that
that teacher would make me be like did you just say words with your face


cause of death the heart killers 
what are words

jokes on you im into that
were in calculus i thought this was chemistry


cause of death the heart killers 
all the same the moment that man walked through that door tbh

looks like trigonometry 

the teacher was like let me explain and then he just wrote something and he didnt even explained it  what a great tutor


cause of death the heart killers 
no one was paying attention thats for sure

typical math class 

yeah tee needs to gtf away from white
but that teacher gave me sus vibes 


cause of death the heart killers 
hes a sleaze but a hot af one


maybe he has all this pressure on him to get good grades and get into a good school maybe scholarships sometimes parents especially east asian parents will put all this pressure on you and even more so when are from a poor family lucky if they dont have a restaurant or business because then you will be pulling double duty with working for them and heavy school load because a good education to good job can take you out of poverty at least thats the goal and the ideal
also idk if new is favoured over non because momma was all about sending new money is new at university cant work a job like she was going to get an emergency loan like i hope it wasnt a loan from a loan shark because girl thats gonna kill ya


cause of death the heart killers 
definitely the pressure is doing nothing for his sanity i feel new might be the son who says hes studying while hes wasting his life away doing nothimg bit get the money from his parents 


you are right plus do we know what country he is in is he in usa london singapore australia because if he was say in usaaustralialondon then even his parttime wages assuming he has scholarship to schoolwork study or under the table is more than what he would make in thailand unless hes just partying it up and getting money from parentsguess we will seethey better tell us and show us lol


cause of death the heart killers 
so many questions too few answers


i wonder if bible was the math consultant for this 


cause of death the heart killers 
you got a point there


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i cant wait for top to get murdered
also tee is an idiot why is he getting the smartest kid in class to be involved with this bank account scam when he has a moron like top right there

he has leverage over non and doesnt over top though

i agree and he doesnt know hes struggling with money and non is unfortunately the easy target 


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
except that top broke the camera and panicked about being able to pay por back it seems like a lot fewer steps for tee to be like dont worry i can help you out vs going through the motions of setting up my sweet lil sweet face non
i know its because he is friends with top and doesnt care aboutactively bullies non but still seems like a lot of extra hassle

hes just a bully 

the bullying was brutal damn i cried i was bullied too and it really leaves you with an indescribable empty feeling what does jin want tho just to date him
also i translated the messages between non and the mysterious person
who could that be wow the backstories were so interesting i love this show


is that a white circle next to the i miss you  
is that white  

no its this emoji 


complete ghost ship right now but i would melt for barcodefuaiz

yess me too but im scared of jin


i am honestly not difficult i would ship anything with barcode or anything with fuaiz if the have to be a polycule i take it 


it looks like an smiley type emoji


oh god i loved and hated this episode with passion
what these motherers did to ton is beyond hideous im so glad theyre all going to die horribly
por is dead and i think top too because fluke was beyond crazy when he shot so two less motherfers tee is going to fall soon because everyone blames him for what he did to ton
its clear who is the guilty party here nons lover and new nons intelligent brother
if you ask me those two are phee and white dont know who is who
i dont think white is so innocent as he seems he is very intelligent so i believe him able to infiltrate the group becoming tees lover and the same with phee with jin
i dont know if jin is guilty too he is the only one who was nons friend so i dont know if he is just a victim whom they hid what happened to non or was the one who stabbed non at the worst moment
the next episode was going to be painful and probably where these aholes take non to the vacation house and kill him so grab the tissues and brace yourselves


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
oooh i like the theory that white is the ex and phee is the brother and they teamed up to get revenge it would make sense that theyd target tee who is clearly getting non caught up in something illegal and jin who was closest to non maybe the hotsuss teacher was doing something unsavory to non and became their first victim
ngl my macauchay ghostshipping heart was hoping barcode and ta would make out at some point but im willing to sacrifice that for a vengeful brother murder spree


bocs cinematography
the fact that someone in the pheetanwhite group that wasnt there for what went down with non also immediately jumped to my mind one of them is definitely the heart or the brother


you managed to put into words my feelings
in the clips white going for tee seems purposeful like he really went for it and it would make sense if it was for long game revenge
also fun note but fuaiz had to say an aggressive line in some of the extra games and he was like i never played a bad guy and everyone howled and laughed i dont know what to make of it 
also would go with the white being sad clip the white fighting jin and white appearing from nowhere
and phee being the big bro would make sense but may also be a red herring salmon know how to play with us 


finally found out some of the backstory and this group of friends are bullies as expected  i dont know why jin and fluke are friends with them maybe peer pressure or to save themselves from being bullied too but they share some of the blame for whatever happened to non  
 the tutor seems sketchy too and i think may have done something to non as well



i love the plot kudos to the writers wow this ep was so good and barcode woah from porchay to non with his entrance he nailed his role and this ep was interesting and unique screw those frnds especially tee and that top guy so selfish and whats with those drugs tho that non intakes something is fishydirection is lit and acting is fineto certain extent love the plotand also the actors and jj looks so different i couldnt recognize him here with his dyed hairteacher role 
i guess its revenge either by that tutor jj or maybe his brother newto whom their parents send money to in abroad idk but i love the story and what they do to non is just so worseand im excited how his ghostmaybe drugged murderers will take his revenge 
i guess jins crush is one sided and he later did some nasty shit to non in the end and that guy is a mystery is he the tutor idk


wasnt non texting with guy before we met the tutor im kinda hoping against hope that we get a jeff satur cameo 


delulu is trululu thatll be a surprise element tho itll be lit

omg that was jj i couldnt even recognize him 


yep thats 2j from kinnporsche to differentiate him from jj or jjay which is paired with fuaiz amazing

i always know him like time from kinnporsche


the only one i feel bad for dying is that old man bringing them food that had his head sliced off by the wire he seemed innocent unless he isnt lol


bocs cinematography
so someone from the pheetanwhite triumvirate is totally a plant they are either the brother or the heart emoji on nons phone or there are two plants and they are working together for revenge
the fact that mr keng is dead he was there for a reason
jin seems so nice here but there is definitely more going on with him he goes from being kind to the school outcast to what we see in the present tees a bastard but im fascinated with him hes not wholly bad as we see with him needing money to help his father and in the present he is willing to run back into danger for white and top being top it seems since the very beginning just wanted to run and save his own ass
por is totally one of those dudes that tries to start either game streaming or podcasting and gets all the expensive cameras and microphones and equipment first before he even knows if hes going to be successful like your iphone would have done the job just fine especially with a found footage movie bitch you want the grain
barcode is killing it with this role though i would have maybe given him a makeunder because they call him greasy and hes got gorgeous shiny hair and is one of the prettiest boys in school
this show is so fucking good so fucking good even though nothing scary happened you could feel the rising tension that we were on a collission course with disaster


someone maybe on tumblr analysed that greasy may be linked to poverty instead of simple appearance 
its like dirt poor and the notion that poor people are dirty which also explains why they wipe their hands after touching him
but agreed barcode is truly beautiful and a pure delight to watch acting


in my villain era
we could do a horror trope bingo with this series they are throwing everything at the wall finally barcode makes his entrance and we are getting the backstory looks like well take a couple episodes to get the full story but there is a lot of episodes to go
flowers to jet he plays the asshole character really well hes absolutely insufferable in this episode
i an sus about the tutor get the feeling well be seeing more of him soon and who is nons parents sending money too what happened to non that hes on meds so many questions as the plot thickens
no timestamps this week as no sexy time and no scares but tw for bullying


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i think its nons brother the mother said something about non studying abroad like his brother does when they were eating dinner



barcode is inda haus barcodenon is brainy he takes medsbipolar pors group is envious they dont have his brain and talent its obvious theyre just using him with jin as the leadman use him and drop himwatabunchofaholesnon still hopes with what he did for them theyd include him in their cliquei can see that set up a mile awaynon is now a mule for money laundering tnx to u evil tee


quick question  has the show established the ages of these characters are they all the same age or just the same class at uni but white is def the youngest right 
 the show heavily hints that new is like an older brother to non but i dont think they explicitly state that new is actually an older brother   my first thought was that new are one in the same but the  emoji is a red herring to make you think that this is a separate person who has a romance with non  except the actual texts are misleading too because theyre not romantic in nature  just i miss yous are you at school are you free to talk very generalized   
but we all know theres no way the new trio whitetanphee came into the friend group by chance at least one or all three maybe is pulling the strings and manipulating things bts in a big way  i would love if theyre all in this for revenge because they all had some specific relationship to non either by blood friendship or romantic entanglement 

oh the theory about  being new is nice i like we see that  is very caring asks if he took the meds asks if he arrived safely i think  but not available when non called them multiple times and the i miss you could also be something between siblings since we know that new is abroad
maybe i misunderstood but who of them 3 is related to non by blood 
but my friend and i had similar theories about at least phee and tan serving reasons to believe in this theory


the show hasnt established that anybody is related to non by blood yet  im just theorizing at this point  but i wouldnt be surprised if it is phee which i would love  possible scenes between the younger brothers of kp count me in  
also correct me if im wrong but dont pheenong translate into older brotheryounger brother in thai  but this could be a mislead though   

yeah i wrote that i could have misunderstood you  english isnt my first language so its hard for me to always understand everything in the way it was meant and thats why i ask  sorry if this bothered you i didnt watch kp so i dont even know who the younger brothers are  i only know ta is playing the younger brother of vegas i think but i dont know whos brother barcode is 
i dont think they would choose these names without any meaning 


just saw this  no worries at all i figured it was a misunderstanding 
the more i think about phee being new the less likely i think itll happen though its way too obvious with the big brotherlittle brother translation and the timeline probably doesnt add up
but i do want some kind of connection between non and phee to be revealed though i just want a scene with them 
you should watch kp its ridiculous and fun at the same time but ta played macau whos the younger brother to vegas and barcode played porschay who is porsches younger brother

porschay and porsche thai and their names 
i have so much on my cw list i need to finish something else first  but kp is definitely on my plan to watch soon list


barcode casting is really spot on he is born for this kind of character i just cant wait to witness his duality i usually despise bullying plots it just pissed me to the hell they do really make a good bullies i hate them

soo everyone except jin is a bully and a piece of shit that makes it so much easier for me to watch them get killed off


in my villain era
i hope before tee gets killed white finds out what an absolute ass he is points if its white that kills him 

same i need tas character jin barcodes character and white to ride off into the sunset while everyone else gets stuck at the murder cabin forever


bocs cinematography
tan too he hasnt done anything wrong yet


see hes the one i feel like were all sleeping on do we know anything about him other than hes phees friend i was thinking maybe he could be new andor   he just comes off as collateral damage and the character that has to ask all the questions so the viewers  can find out more info  hes the most sus to me at least right now of the trio whitepheetan  


i have a maybe crazy theory
what if jin is behind the mask ghost attacks he seems to be genuine with non at least from what we have seen its clearly a group effort more than 1 ghost and prioritizing the  who bullied non and are involved in nons disappearance that will also make sense since he wants to leave everything behind after this trip and go abroad also maybe the ones with him are the new non brother and the one non was texting heat emoji
i cant wait to see what will happen


i dont think its jin because he gets attacked too and he hears these crazy voices that phee didnt hear episode 1 balcony scene only top heard them too as far as i remember so the attack wouldnt be a reason to negotiate the theory but the voices wouldnt make sense to only act as if he would hear something if phee doesnt hear them too and he sees mr keng and hears voices again but phee sees and hears nothing


i see your point and i agree and i assume jin is not totally innocent in the end maybe something that involves the tutor
i really like the theory that many people are involved for revenge and have a mole inside the group there is so much going on and i really want answers and a lot of twists


in my villain era
not crazy that would actually fit in horror trope wise for the unhinged character out for vengeance


i would just like to hold poor non in my arms

wow i definitely feel a bit scared to watch the next episode and i do not even remember flinching while watching the glory


bocs cinematography
im at stupid work and customers are being stupid and i just want to watch this shoooooowwwww but i cant just leave because im management and have to close


lol ditto i just want to flip the on eternal lunch break back when im good and ready sign


i had so many thoughts about this episode its insane my friend threw the guess in that she would love a twist that  is actually one of the boys in the house who helps non to get revenge i think it could be she named tan for example and oh boy now i see 23930 things that would totally fit in this theory what also fits to it phee was the one who assumed to watch a movie searched through the stuff suggested to make a remake insisted inetc also white randomly encouraging tee in this wanting to see them making the remake although they didnt see a lot of the movie yet so why are you so down bad for this lmao they saw nothing much interesting to be so excited for a remake but thats probably nothing  only us getting lost in theories
i assumed  was perth in the beginning since we dont know him yet the teacher is also sketchy but he didnt know him when he got the message so but obviously something happened to the teacher  wonder if non was involved in this what happened to the teacher i mean oh i hope thats nothing connected to abusesa or something like this like someone mentioned non looked so uncomfortable with the teacher alone in the classroom he looked pretty okay almost proud  i mean the teacher looked okay and nice but heyits always the nice guys  but back to the  it would totally make sense if it would someone we already know because there is no name but they give us immediately a message from jin to show its not jin what many people probably assumed because jin is so nice to non
so far tan and phee are the only ones who never saw the killer alone only when they were with others or i oversaw something my memory is bad so i wouldnt be surprised fluke didnt see him too but i guess thats because hes always with por and he got strangled lol
the moment we saw non taking meds i screamed what if they get drugged and seehear things because of this  and of course the question for what does he take them its a lot of stuff hes taking
i think we definitely see that phee white and tan are less involved in things happening to them than the boys who knew non so far white tan and phee also didnt hear the mysterious voices that jin and top heard in the first episode
i also wonder how phee and tan join the group in the beginning and how tee and white met
fluke looks so fucked up all the time  hes so passive and quiet only wants to become a doctor but everyone around him fucks up and drags him into it this guy seems mentally absolutely not okay  i hate him a bit because hes so harsh to my crybaby white but i also understand himkinda hes confusing af as he should be i know he looks very observant but not obvious there to see for others like in the scene with the broken camera  and it doesnt make any sense for him to stay there longer and destroy the walkietalkie if it would be for his career because things are only getting worse if they stay longer and dont get out of this freaking cabin i am so curious about his character why hes always so annoyed and fucked up why he is friends with them well that also counts for white tan jin and phee this group seems so off why do they even spend time together phee and tee also have this tension all the time that they are fed up with eo what is his role here expect of a sophomore med student and a detective conan viewer 
i am definitely looking forward to next weeks episode although i find the flashback a little bit too draggy sometimes i just love how interesting the story is it leaves so much room for theories although it starts with a clich plot a group of friends a cabin in the wood a bully victim disappeared and yet its not predictable what really happened so good considering that its the second  show from this company rookie actors and we all know that bls doesnt have a huge budget this show is really great so far
edit another thing that leaves me confused the bathroom scene with white in the beginning of the show where his skin had those bubbles on it he doesnt really look concerned about this and he doesnt really care about them just disappearing 



profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
at first i was like awwww poor por just dying out here now im like idgaf theyre all such bullies omg  minus sweet jin of course big fan of jin but omg my heart hurts for non 

jokes on you im into that
everyone is analyzing the clues weve gotten and my ass is over here omfg thats names room why would they reuse names house for yet another character that gets overlookedtreated badly by friends boc youre some sick people i highly doubt it was planned
