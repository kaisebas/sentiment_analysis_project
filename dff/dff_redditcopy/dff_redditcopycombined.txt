fr i admire his convictions and if a random innocent man had to die for that welp rip anyway stan tan and his d face while his fake friends kill each other

i love ta and jin and fluke but i was just rooting for tan the entire episode lol i can see everything from everyones side and put myself in everyones shoes  i can even see things from tops pov his uncle is a criminal hes poor like what is he supposed to do realistically i honestly dont even hate anyone in this cast or see anyone as a villain tho jjs tutor keng was fucking yikies af even tho theyre murderers and bullies but tan has my sword absolutely right now i was lowkey giddy when everything at the cabin was chaos and he was trying very hard not to smile fully in satisfaction my smart bb  lmao

in my villain era
well im not sure how i feel after todays episode we have 5 episodes left and today was the big reveal already jin got off way too lightly for the confession
im going to try and remain positive that they will stick the landing and we still havent solved the mystery of what happened to non so that is still a big question mark
im leaning into white having an agenda as well and hes going to be the one to get out of this
only one warning 2900min  shooting


cause of death the heart killers 
i think its only 12 episodes the final episode is being screened on march 8th
white seems shady indeed


in my villain era
ohhh it changed ok two more then not as bad thenbut was hoping theyd draw it out a little more


cause of death the heart killers 
me too but the pacing seems good next sammon will write just about us as viewers watcbing her series and it will be called trauma to where do i send my therapy bills 


in my villain era
i went to check the writing team and its not just sammon there are 4 of them with solid resumes im feeling better now we are in good hands

i think its only 2 episodes left final episode live screening is 8 march so 2 more weeks


cause of death the heart killers 
bump the actor that you are im in awe guys like weve been steadily growing this hostility towards his character but boy is he doing the most fear paranoia hatred fury he portrayed every aspect in an excellent way and i am impressed he stole this episode theres no two ways about it am i happy that top seems to be out well happy is a strong word but i wont be missing him tan is finally getting some answers but i dont think hes gonna like them my heart broke with whites when he learned about tees involvement in nons disappearance i still believe theres more to white and that preview is giving me hope also giving us hope for nons whereabouts the previews
one thing for sure im making peace with the fact that this series wont have a happy ending whatever happens the characters that survive are gonna need years of therapy i hope uthoughtsallday is planning accordingly


bocs cinematography
honestly i would love if this didnt have a happy ending its doing so much h stuff thats anathema to the bl formula and im living


cause of death the heart killers 
it would be iconic tbh 


same i dont think this should have a happy ending the story has had so many twists and turns up until now that i hope this continues until the end and we dont get a formulaic bl ending

thank you huntress  i bailed at ep7 and have watched only the nc and kissing scenes since then 
praying for all of you on the front lines 


cause of death the heart killers 
oh good i was worried you were watching





this time i will just say that i am sure we are being bamboozled
things dont fit the narrators are either lying or unreliable
the computers dont match
phee knows things he is not supposed to
phee says he is still nons boyfriend
jin still sees a bloody keng as a fear for no damn reasons
tan was on the couch with fluke and top when por was empaled he cannot have raised the branch last minute
and we know from the preview that tee is absolutely lying about non
there is a ninth person
we are being cleverly bamboozled we think we know because the characters admitted and we dont and only the next two episodes will properly shed light on everything
edit  just to precise that i am loving every second of it and tee was my favourite this episode


i hope youre right i really do im not gonna shut any of these down why would i my hope against hope is they throw us off completely and pull off an ending so surprising and unexpected
my fear is that none of this could be a red herring manipulation everything is face value it is what we showed you the writers lost their steam rounding 3rd base they dont stick the landing yay sports metaphors they dont catch me off guard and it goes exactly as anticipated
so after the show is over ill look back at it as a show that i spent way too much time on its potential was never full reached for me and its yet another thai bl that flubbed up its own ending
this is my ultimate fear for this show

this is my ultimate fear for this show
wait you need to be surprised by the ending for it to be good what lol
i think if everything ends with everything weve been shown being face value thats amazing and sticking the landing  the writing on this show so far has been great with so much obvious attention to detail character nuance and intention and i love that i think everything being what weve been shown at the end of the day would be a brilliant ending i love stunts and gags but m night shyamalan twists just to gag the girls can be so tired
like just have a pov and tell the story you want to tell the way you want to tell it and ill be down to clown if its interesting and done well and i think what dff has done so far has been amazing it reminds me of peeps that were disappointed with only friends and most of all mew because he wasnt diabolical like everyone imagined lol

i have a hard time believing that knowing the team of author on the show
the dedication to keeping the show and part of the cast under wraps
and the attention to details until now
but i am a glass half full king of person so we will see but all signs points to us getting deliciously bamboozled and since we already were before i mean episodes 14 were lacklustre until we had the flashback and then everything suddenly clicked marvellously i am confident it will be so again

i can understand phee falling in love but acting like it was nothing when jin confessed he upload the video dude wtf and wtf about wanting to help our friends you had to stop non from killing himself thanks to these friends
glad at least tan got his objetive and finally tee is talking i hope that knowing what happened jin and phee regretted what they did and start the crying
fluke has been awesome here i know he did what he did because the drugs but it was time to tell tee he is a bastard and rotten
white realizing the real colours of his boyfriend is heartbreaking but it was necessary
por and top who were two who most hurt non are out now its your time tee

i also was like hmmm that was a mild response when phee was like we both messed up i definitely was like yeah but in very different ways and then there was no discussion about the video and the fact that jin liked non as well and what have they are to each other now with the new details like i would be cracking skulls if someone did some revenge pon stuff like that to my boyfriend i know they were young but come on



phee you spineless loser there is no way that hole is so good that you can instantly be that chill and sprung for jin after finding out this is the guy who filmed and then circulated one of the most horrifying parts of your bfs trauma i know that this is a bl at the end of the day so they want to give the fans some cute romance but damn what a let down there was all that build up of jins nice guy sins just for a glossed over admission and a very repetitive and unnecessary goingincircles scene and some pandering romantic words set to sentimental music and then jin had the nerve to yell at tee while jin literally just stood there watching all this shit go down and no one calls him out on it the lowest point in the ep for me for sure i understand if phee thinks his yelling at non to go die is just as bad as jin posting his unrequited crushs dubcon sextape to the internet but theres no way that the writers think that right right lol i really hope the narrative punishes jin still even if phee wont
new they can never make me hate you any time the camera panned to his smiling at the pain he was causing i laughed too fuck those guys
tee give me hope for redemption he even had zuko makeup lol now this is the soul crushing guilt i expected to see from jin but never got idk if its the superior acting or writing or direction or just because the actor is tall so i got blinders on but im rooting for him to survive somehow hopefully next ep we can see how he put his money where his mouth is and actually helped non and if not rip to this hottie
fluke mvp got rid of annoying ass top got tee to confess and move this plot forward gave us more cute whimpering white he was so good he carried the ep for me i also love that the show is treating flukes doing nothing as he witnessed this bullying as just as bad as all the bullying that happened
ultimately i am trying to temper my expectations bc this is a bl but im still really hoping the narrative follows through on a satisfying ending if pheejin just walk off into the sunset holding hands no harm no foul then im going to hunt them down with an axe myself lol
excited for perth and more non and tee focus next ep love this series im hype for more


something makes me think fluke has definitely done more than weve seen hes been exceedingly passive but his reactions go beyong the drive to get to be a doctor and then there is white he may be innocent in the initial aspect but i still feel like hes a hidden factor may have even met non in what appears to be a brothel maybe heard the story and be there as another figure to help disrupt the group


idk if i agree about fluke i think his character exists as the friend who did nothing while this boy was bullied so terribly and thats enough for the guilt to eat away at him and cause these excessive reactions i hope youre right about white


omg i had the same feeling about jin oh yes so i filmed non and posted it online and ruined nons life and his family reputation but oh well things happen
jin had lots of attitude talking to phee and new and im sorry the only thing jin does is talking and no action
i really hope they dont feed us with a pheejin ending couple cause i will be forever mad


jins attempt at action is so surface level which i actually loved about him i liked that all he did was go guys thats not cool  a couple times then continued to pull non into his friends shitty web he knew how terribly non was being treated and continued to tempt and encourage him to hang out with them repeatedly just because he was selfish and sprung and wanted non for himself i liked that he was vengeful and bitter and awful when non was being preyed upon by the teacher and then this guy stays friends with these assholes for three more years genuinely enjoyed all these character driven bad choices because i thought the story would give him his comeuppance and it mirrored flukes similar stoodthereandwatched story
but now with phee getting lost in the sauce and openly doting on him and how everyone seems to express their guilt and remorse way more intensely than jin did in his one scene of admitting his sins i am losing hope that jin is going to get what he deserves i want to trust the writers but idk its a shame because jins character would be way more interesting without the main ship plot armor


i agree with everything you said i live jin and fluke basically mirroring each other but fluke is aware of his inactions and jin belive he is the good guy and did nothing wrong i would have loved it if jin till the end stayed delusional about his level of involvement but i cant shake the feeling that they are gonna make pheejin the endgame



this is kind of how i feel about him too in the flashback scenes jin gave me the feeling of a spider drawing non into an inescapable web despite having feelings for non he not only failed to protect him from his toxic friend group but encouraged him and dragged him into their schemes a huge difference from my personal weatherman where the two leads met under similar circumstances  yoh was a social outcast who was seen as a creep for staring at people and drawing pictures of them mizuki deliberately walked away from his friends whod been gossiping about him to befriend yoh directly  which is what jin should have done if he cared about nons wellbeing his veneer of niceness is like a paperthin balm over their rot making him as culpable as the rest of them even if his intentions werent malicious in a way he reminds me of a siren luring non with promises of friendship acceptance and belonging to satisfy his own selfish wants as sirens in the myths tempted sailors with their deepest desires he tempts non with his desire to be part of an inner circle rather than an outsider but he doesnt back up those promises leading non into ruin
while there might be cultural differences between thailand and the countries where international audiences reside regarding the laws and perception around distributing child pornography filming underage revenge porn with the intent to circulate it on the internet is a serious offense the devastating impact of revenge porn and sextortion scams have caused many teenagers and even grown adults to take their own lives when he filmed and uploaded the video to a server he was thinking only of himself and his own feelings of pain heartbreak and betrayal considering how its been handled in this show and his role in an established bl pair i dont think jin will face any narrative payback for his actions but i think it highlights his character as someone who finds it easier to be nice than to be kind unlike flukes silent complicity he has a conscience and the instinct to do whats right but he consistently retreats into maintaining the status quo he is essentially a coward and says as much in episode 1 when phee accuses him of running away from his problems in episode 8 fluke pointedly asks jin as non is being taken away are you going to stop him in that moment hes being asked if he can rise to the occasion which he doesnt i hope in the final two episodes hell stand up for somebody for real instead of just asking his friends not to call non mean names i agree that without the inevitable bl happy ending hed be a much more interesting character


ugh love how you described the state of things its so true i havent watched mpw yet but heavy yes  if jin really felt bad he would have dropped those friends dude stuck with them for years even after they bullied the shit out of non
i do hope jin is able to rise the occasion i just dont see right now how that would absolve him of uploading non con porn lol i have am trying to remain hopeful though

100 all of this


rwrb ofc bmftms
basically jin behaved like a nice guy he always tried to be nice to non as well as integrate him into the group but when he felt betrayed his first impulse was to leak an erotic video


does anybody see some similarities between tannew and hamlet theyre both haunted by ghosts real or imagined burdened by grief and driven to seek revenge for the death of a family member but rather than killing their targets directly they plan to extract a confession by orchestrating an elaborate playwithinaplay tannews decision to hide his return from england from his parents and shoulder his burdens by himself mirrors nons decision to hide his massive debt from phee and hamlets decision to feign madness alone  this isolation inadvertently leads to the deaths of their loved ones compounding their grief and trauma he seems to be teetering on the edge of sanity and the willingness to live reminiscent of hamlets struggle with suicidal thoughts and mental instability we dont know if hes actually committed murder yet but if his reaction to top being shot is any indication he doesnt care about collateral damage can new become the person he once was or is he doomed to die as tan ultimately hamlet ends in a bloodbath emphasizing the cyclical nature of revenge and violence with two sons dead a family torn apart and pors family likely to seek retribution its hard to imagine that the survivors lives would return to normal again 
since the woods featured more prominently in this episode and it does seems like theres someone following phee and jin among those trees i was also thinking if they serve as a means to seek justice for the marginalized in this show if boxlike buildings and geometric structures represent societal institutions trapping and oppressing people at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid like non and his family then the uninhabited woods could offer a path to justice denied to them by the police or the courts it might symbolize a space for the aggrieved and the wronged where the accumulation of material wealth has no power
this episode was slowpaced and felt a bit like filler but i guess it was a chance to pause and breathe after the revelations of the past couple episodes kudos to bump and jjay for completely owning their scenes especially considering theyre rookie actors cant wait for the next episode to reveal whites backstory well find out if hes going to be the final girl after all


honestly at this point no one can piss me off more than jin the way he talked to phee before his confession and then talking to tan the attitude and entitlement
he really doesnt feel guilty or anything about whatever he done to non its all just lipservice and it doesnt matter at least fluke the forever bystander is feeling a smidge in concise
i really enjoyed flukes acting this episode

why am i not binging it after it ends why i need to wait another week for the next episode
i cant even describe how i love this show its so good well made exciting so many plot twists man im telling you i will be recommending this show like i did with kinnporsche what an masterpiece everyone should watch that its really incredible
im glad well see more of perth in the next episode i wonder what his role is little whitey is not a good guy how surprising in reality non will be the final boy d
edit i also cant believe a boring piece of crap like fricking playboyy the series has 14 episodes and a show with an amazing writing and great characters only 12 just a random thought


i feel like this episode painted tannew into such a one dimensional character and im not sure if im willing to believe it i feel like theyre trying to trick us and i honestly am more intrigued than ever before really pissed off at phee but i feel like thats intentional as well i will say though im gonna be eternally pissed off if pheejin are endgame  thats all


ill be disappointed too at this point it doesnt feel right to be endgame and happy if a couple is to end up together id prefer pheenon and theyre scheming together


cause of death the heart killers 
im reloading that webpage like a madwoman 

bump and jj really carried this episode bump the most were getting the backstory and everything is being woven together there is another time jump back but it was marked this time lol idk i dont have as many thoughts this episode theres more answers finally but theres still some big questions about nons whereabouts and what the endgame is
in the preview we see more perth and white and thats exciting to see how they play into the mix phee wasnt hard on jin at all but idk maybe its cause they both have blame here getting to the end


yooooo i was happy clapping each time someone else freaked out let them all get hurt or die i dont care  i dont know why phee is suddenly not on board with that  police wont do anything anyways so get the information take revenge and leave xd
anyways white is up to sth as well right
also non still alive huh but to get money 

well i figured that phee wouldnt be part of the whole murdering part of the plan but its good to have confirmation that tannew did go rogue on his own
hmmm im kinda of 2 minds about phee spilling the beans to jin and then forgiving so quickly when jin confessed to being the one who posted the video on the one hand i feel like they should both be waaay more upset with each other phee lied about his motivations for joining their friend group and getting close to jin for 3 fucking years meanwhile jin posted literal child pornography of phees first love which was the nail in the coffin for nons entire life collapsing phee is complicit in the deaths that happen at that house and jin is complicit in nons disappearance as well as nons parents committing suicide on the other hand while its inarguable here that jin triggered a cascade with devastating consequences mental health is not that cutanddry and they could have already been down that path with or without the video leaking so its not fair to blame one person for someones suicide and the gang uncle wanted to shut non up well before the video leaked so his disappearance was largely inevitable and the video just gave them a convenient coverup excuse theyve both also had 3 years to stew in their own shame and selfblame so it is understandable how that might make them feel like blaming each other less
interesting how tannew tries to stoke a confession out of someone by bringing up how this is like nons movie but white is the one who brings up drugs and hallucination i really gotta know what role he has to play in all of this maybe hes been a mole from the gambling gang the whole time planted at tees side to make sure he doesnt betray them or try to dig into what happened to non or my previous theory about him having gotten close to the gang to find out what happened to keng bc he was also groomed and raped by him could still hold up
man that rope on top is so freaking loose and hes so crazed im surprised he hasnt just hulkripped out of it lol tho i will say as much as i hated top as a character and jets screamshout performance as him this version where theres a chemically induced reason for him to act deranged is really welldone im sorry for ragging on you earlier jet please play insanely unhinged characters more often bc i think thats your strong suit however one last note no one dies from a gut shot that quickly you could have agonized a bit more instead of almost immediately collapsing tbf that could have been just how u were directed or they edited out a chunk of the dying process
ngl i was mad worried that fluke would end up shooting tee before he could finally confess goodriddance to top ive come around to the actor but the character is a garbage human who deserved to die
hold up i thought keng got hit by a car hes still kickin hmmmm i wonder if the longhaired goon ended up having a soft spot for non and letting him go or maybe non somehow escaped and he lied about it to the boss to cover his ass
tee you lying idiot what the fuck do you mean your uncle betrayed you and you didnt know what would happen to non you threatened non yourself with organ harvesting and death if he tried to rat out their money laundering scheme
oof white looks genuinely heartbroken to find out the kind of person tee really is
oooooh ok from the preview maybe tee really did try to help non escape his uncles clutches seems like he didnt go straight to organ harvestingoh no what if by sell parts they mean prostitution maybe tee was setting up to try to buy nons freedom but his uncle decided it was too much of a risk and killed non anyways fuuuuck the horrors of nons life really never end oooo but what if white actually met non first while he was being held captive by the gang and he decided to go on a similar revenge mission as tannew bc non was his first love too ok that actually wouldnt make much sense bc non was cute but he couldnt have managed to get 3 seperate boys all falling for him at once and would be silly writing to repeat tannews motivation in a completely unrelated character but a girl can dream eh
pretty short ep not really filler but definitely a break from the action and mystery to let the characters confess and breath which i think was needed as a sort of buffer between the buildup of eps 19 and the endgame of the last 2 we got a lot of necessary setup but it still maintained the tension which is pretty impressive tbh i wonder if well find out next ep for sure what nons final fate is im betting theyll save it for the finale

finally a smart comment about phijin thanks

tbh while im living for the subtlety in the characters for the most part i kind of wish there was less nuance and they could just be mad at each other i understand why time and guilt has tempered it but i wanted to see them feel that rage and disgust at each others wrong doings


they could still be selling organs could be they sold kengs organs first since he was already injured by the car considering the preview show non bruised and injured could be that the gang was in the middle of selling his organ part by part



bocs cinematography
 so nobody else caught that someone else was marking the trees and them going in circles was probably on purpose phee didnt have a very big reaction about that video confession hes been fairly stoic but he also dropped the axe outside the house and his explanation of new setting the traps did not answer for the knife wounds on pors arms as well as the impalement phee was leading jin around on purpose and his demeanor totally changed when he said i will protect you what if he was talking to non and not jin and non was out in the woods too and they are in this together the whole time there is still the other mask that was wearing the black shoes that attacked them in the graveyard
 god jjay fucking killed it this episode tees always been my fave character and this just cemented it hes so complicated i felt tees heart break when whites view of him changed whatever else he is tee loves white genuinely when i rewatched tee and whites sex scenes for science after tee looked at white he had this desperate look on his face i also believe that he probably killed his uncle
 fluke also is so fascinating the bystander is now the only active murderer of the gang that we know of  we only have phees word on the new stuff bitch your hands are dirty  you aint no bystander anymore
 news glee at tops death was everything this man is going to have a wild ride on his next turn on the karmic wheel
 some of the things that white said to tee were very hmmmmmm he said that tee promised he wouldnt be testy just like tee said white promised he would be obedient and then said you said you wanted to be friends with these people which is an odd phrasing in a show where nothing seems like an accident and wherever white was in that preview was not a friendly upstanding place
 okay wild theory time  what if white buys one of nons organs non has to pay off his debt that can either mean sex trafficking or it could mean organ harvesting which is something that has even been mentioned before by tee what if whites fear of being sick has to do with that and hes black market buying a desperate persons organs or he could just be some fucked up rich person who likes to pay to hurt desperate poor people the other mask in the black shoes has crutches what if non is maimed somehow


i saw the marks were different but i thought it was oversight but it bothered me how off the scene felt and how underwhelmed i felt by phees actionsreactions this whole episode leaving behind the axe really bugged me too im like how has he gotten so stupid
if the long con is still at play praying new is apart of this too and if its a big scheme with multiple players ill eat my words take back every single even slightly negative thing ive posted and i will forever be this shows bitch i swear like i hated this episode
so heres 


i think phee knows theres another person there hes leading jin back to the house but leading him in circles until he gets the mark from the person in the woods that its time to go back the plan has always been to get them to kill each other in the house so now that jin has confessed phee is taking him back he probably did want to spare jin because he did seem the nicest of the friends but now hes being led in phee left the axe for the 9th person to pick up


this is what i hope for sure and i can see it i definitely picture the 9th being non and i can see phee after jins reveal being actually surprised by it and not wanting it to be true but then he knows hes gotta bring jin back into the chaos and whatever happens happens
new is definitely getting his wish bc he wanted them to turn on and eat each other the og five are all made of weak stuff for sure jury is still out on jins ending for me though


bocs cinematography
i am so fucking pissed that i have to work and cant watch this for a few hours

that axe phee dropped will probably come in to play later right  the way the camera lingered on it would suggest so
after rewatching the first four episodes im convinced that phee either purposely lied to jin or that hes just wrong about what happened putting this under a spoiler tag for people who wanna go back and rewatch do it  its fun
there are scenes in the first two episodes where the masked killer is using crutches


bocs cinematography
im also convinced that the axe will come back i think phee dropped it on purpose and there was someone else non in the woods with them marking the trees to purposely discombobulate jin and the crutch mask also had black shoes where top had white shoes there were two masks

also something else that made me go  in my rewatch especially in episode 1 are the scenes between the phee and white
i might be reading to much into this but when theyre making the movie phee acts as the director and white is his actor the directoractor thing is emphasized phee i believe were told as studying to become a film director and later when tee scolds white i thought we agreed that youd be nice if i brought you here youd be obedient white answers im obidient and one more thing its just acting
theres also a moment early in the first episode where having just watched the short film they made phee nods to white when tan asks why they havent introduced them to non then phee nods to white again when white says something that convinces tee to agree to shoot a new short film
also also and sorry for the rambling but isnt white shown wearing the same type of school uniform as phee in one of the flashbacks


most of the stuff about tannew that phee said to jin is just what he thinks happened since he believe the only person who could do it is tan it is entirely possible that the person who killed uncle deng is someone else


this ep went by fast for me and felt almost fillery probably because there were a lot of explanatory flashbacks and reveals that most viewers had already knownassumed so it was a matter of just bringing all the other characters up to speed
i think jins confession about what he did to non felt downplayed and seemed like they just wanted to get that out of the way to push forward with pheejin which i get bc theyre the stars of this bl but idk if i could be with someone who did revenge porn also was there a point to having them going in circles i was hoping it was a set up for something intentional but nope just several minutes of being lost honestly thought they couldve had just the dialogue of phee reassuring jin and immediately cut to them finding their way out the woods
fluke is absolutely unhinged his role as the bystander during nons abuse is finally catching up to him and hes consumed by the guilt and frustration of it all the actor is played the scenes really well and is top actually dead im not a doctor but it seems like he was shot closer to his lower abdomen than stomach and could potentially live if he was treated or i guess im supposed suspend my disbelief and assume a single bullet got him which im not mad about either 
so based on the flashbacks and ep preview it looks like non was made to work at a casino to pay off his debt and maybe he meets white whose motivesconnections with the whole group still arent entirely clear if they keep showing non alive in these flashbacks could they be teasing that hes still alive part of me thinks no because if he has to endure that kind of hardship with nothing left to lose then a second suicide attempt wouldnt be out of character for him i would love to be wrong though
2 episodes left and i still have so many questions


yeah something is definitely up even if theyre agreeing new is out of his mind both phee and jin have reasons to distrust the other extremely but are still ok phee tells him that theyd planned his whole thing out to drug them admits that getting involved with jin was because he was the easy target and then distanced after fking only to bring them into this situation jin admits to recording and posting the video out of jealousy and a onesided crush which definitely accelerated nons descent  disappearanceyet they still can work together i actually thought phee was going to try and attack him with the ax
i feel deeply that there is more to flukes actions than just guilt for being a bystanderpassive participant even his obsession with getting into school isnt holding up because now with 2 definitely dead and 1 severely injured he cant think this will just vanish
im also holding out that this is a plot by non simply given how he rewrote that script he may attempt suicide again but i feel hed want revenge first on at least tee whos actions despite him feeling remorse now were the ones that pushed non the furthest on this path


phee is an asshole he can go eat shit how can he just forget what jin did to non like non is not a saint but hes the victim here like what is going on in his head did he just forget what happened to non did he hit something and what happened to tannew plan like wtf

this felt like a filler episode atleast another person died though i wasnt surprised that fluke pulled the trigger i knew he was going to kill someone due to his paranoia 
the pheejin confession was a little anticlimactic but if they are actually endgame then i guess it makes sense
i cant help but feel like we are headed towards a phee vs tan showdown and a jin vs nonalive showdown



so anti climatic i didnt like that they were just ok with the reveals like bbs its ok to feel a certain way about people doing bad things that affect you even if you feel you dont have a right to feel this
phee was an accomplice to a person that drugged jin and he remained complicit like jin couldve died from this jin posted a sex video of phees thenboyfriend which led to his down spiral amongst many other things that shouldve never happened to non non couldve died just from this committed suicide successfully
i never wanted this scene to happen in the first place but i hope phee is lying and luring jin into a false sense of security like hes assumingtelling very specific things that he shouldnt know like how was he able to put 2 and 2 together in such a specific way
now do i like pheejin sure do i think they have chemistry absolutely do i need them to be endgame hell no i dont
edit i forgot jin lied to the police about non which ill assume phee already knew about anyway he knows they all gave statements mightve even read them

im pretty convinced that phee isnt out for revenge killing at this point he just wanted answers for what happened to non initially his lust for jin got in the way and now he actually has feelings for jin i think either they die together or survive together  


this has been my thinking since the team up in episode 8 i still think this but things did not add up today with phee how did he flip his script so fast why did he refer to these assholes as friends this was so shocking to me why does he still call non his boyfriend how does he place the axe on the ground and seconds later he forgets to pick it up again how in the world is he revealing so many specific things about new in his confession when he wasnt present for most of this theyre really specific assumptions on his part
finally the scene in the woods is so noticeably weird does he have zero sense of direction hes the one leading and he keeps leading them in circles like three different times and the marks on the tree are never the same what was this scene
the more i hone in on it the weirder i feel about these things also how does jin know tans real name again do i have to make another assumption

hey maybe they are playing an uno reverse card on us its either that or  the writing may have just gotten messy or translations were dodgy 


i immenssely agree with you i dont want pheejin as endgame but they do have great chemistry but hell no i dont want them as endgame after what jin did to poor non


we kinda needed an episode where they all found out about new so i can forgive them 

im so damn curious about where they are going with this because it feels way too early for us to have some of this information so either theyre kind of fumbling the ending possible or there are more surprises and twists in store for us that were not expecting
todays ep actually gave me exactly what i was hoping  phee and jin talking to each other and seeing how their situations parallel  which of course means that im now highly suspicious of it haha is phee being genuine is jin being genuine i wonder
im kind of sad at all the anger towards phee because im actually kind of adoring that theyre subverting the usual expectations towards horror everyone and their dog thought that phee was out for revenge after ep 6 so i love the fact that instead the show went actually well have to see how it plays out im still kind of wondering if one or both of them is fooling the other
another possibility is that what they think happened is just not the case this is mainly towards phee  im really curious if hes setting tan up or even jin is it possible that hes the one at fault i dont know
at any rate im really curious to see the backstory play out more in the next ep and to finally get some answers on who perth is and what happened to non after we last saw him

i dont have iqiyi so i have to wait till tomorrow to watch the new episode 


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i am a little more suss about phee after watching this episode its a pretty common horror trope for one character to tell another character all the horrible things the villain has done and then for there to be a reveal that actually the teller was behind everything its one of those things that i dont think theyre going to reveal that he was actually the one to kill por and uncle deng but if they did it would make sense to me
jins confession was pretty glossed over but i also think that right now phees focus is getting them both out alive since hes realizing how far off the deep end tan has gone i can totally buy him compartmentalizing that right now because he cant really react the way he would if they were not literally fighting for their lives


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
also me when top got shot and probably died



tannew is an evil geniuswhats crazier and scarier is an evil genius hell bent on revenge with nothing to loosephee why you got cold feet all of a sudden and spilled the teayou knew whats at stakeyou knew going in what tannew is capable ofso mr keng was sold for organ trafficking while non i presumed is in slave labor somewheretannew carry ongive your brother justicewhat of white am surehe is not that innocent



i dont understand how an episode can be so action packed and yet be filler at the same time  like what was this episode it was 35 minutes and were in the home stretch now grrrr
this is a rant
what was the whole pheejin walking in an endless circle in the woods stuff i get its to heighten a sense of foreboding and paranoia about where they are in relation to this cult but its just filler and they make it out in no time anyway therefore i dont care sorry not sorry also im real tired of jin just yelling at people particularly phee
my boy is trying whatre you doing whatve you done
also the shows strengths are in the complexity of its characters and the actions they specifically takedont take that affect other characters this drives the plot forward not supernatural elements that get thrown in here and there to keep a certain element alive in the series
last thing its already been established that the drugs are the source of the pandemonium soooyeah for me its not horrorsupernatural never has been i just find it dumb and distracting and it takes me out of the show this particular thing has always bugged me especially now that were near the endgame 
edit can anyone explain to me the point of fluke calling out tee on the leaked video in episode 4 but jin states hes responsible for all of it in this episode i hope this isnt a misfire

yeah im gonna admit that the drugs annoyed me and i would have preferred supernatural but this show is really a psychological thrillermystery so ive made peace with it 


 this made me lol cause im exactly the opposite i prefer the drugs over the supernatural so i still get my way i guess but the shows not over yet cause i never bought into it at all
and when itll kind of pop up herethere i get annoyed so i havent made peace with this aspect 
im like show you are a suspensepsychological thriller bl so can we let go of this other part and push forward without filler please

ijbol every f time tan grins like a little shit

ugh this episode was too short tbh this felt like a filler episode other than top getting killed and tan jumping the shark there was little story progression and we only have 2 episodes left
finally we have another death were way too far into the series to have only one main character being killed
i was gagged to find out that tan purposefully orchestrated the deaths of por and the uncle he has truly gone off the deep end im so excited for the inevitable showdown he will have with phee at the end
they have been ramping up the romance angle for phee and jin at first i was doubtful their love story would survive till the end but i guess the producers realize that this show is still a bl and we have to have some romance to root for
poor white i truly have no idea what his fate holds at the end of this series either he will be a casualty of tees actions or hell be the final girl theres no in between


we still dont know if it was tannew phee said he thought it was newtan


yeah youd think phee would have done more to put a stop to things the second he found out that new was killing people highly suspicious that he did nothing after a gruesome beheading of an innocent man has anyone checked his pockets for concertina wire

you know what  i just hate everyone in this series  they better all die no survivor no happy ending
just let them all die 

im not sure what to make of this episode im hoping that phee is just a bad narrator and we dont really know what has happened yet its too easy to all be tannew i still think there is another person involved and they are probably going to get that axe phee conviently forgot about
the pheejin confession and jin confronting tan all felt a bit underwhelming and short they heard the information and just moved on to the next thing im hoping phee is just in survival mode as i could have slapped him when he said lets go save our friends
next week looks promising finally some teewhite answers white seems to be at the uncles place does he help non here it was hard seeing them hurt non on the rooftop


wait i missed that he said our friends no no nooooo i guess i hated the whole scene so much that i only half payed attention
thats some jump the shark material right there i cant watch that cause i dont want to  in my mouth
the math aint mathin for me on this he has to be bullshitting right right
that is a very specific betrayal to non and i cant justify this at all if it isnt addressed like wtf phee


bocs cinematography
phees reactions are strange  there is definitely more to it than that ta once described phee as a manipulative character he should have been angrier about the confession of the video release considering how it blew everything up and the way his demeanor in the woods suddenly changed when he said i will protect you i dont think he was talking to jin they werent alone in those woods

i agree he had me very confused this episode i think he knows more than hes letting on as soon as jin confessed he conviently found an axe to escape and he knew full well about drinks being drugged but gave jin that bottle of water i find it hard to accept that after everything he wants to protect that group
i have a feeling pors hallucination of non was real as well was tan not in the house


bocs cinematography
yeah he was in the living room with top and fluke
idk phee seems like once jin confessed phee instead of trying to leave it was like we got to help our friends who really is a friend i think he told him to see if he had anything to do with non he didnt even get mad when jin confessed to video and uploaded it


well to me it seemed like phee was never that much invested in revenge plan and it showed it here he literally didnt care that jin filmed and posted the video online like it was nothing


with all the twists that have been coming up i wouldnt be surprised if this is all nons plot he does have reason to be pissed at them all and he was clearly spiraling before disappearing the only one he wouldnt really have been aware of at that time would be jins actions but otherwise hed have some anger to them al including family mom clearly was picking favorites and not very supportive dad was much like jin in relative passiveness and hes probably be jealous of new based on moms treatment phee abandoned him after the vid white is the only innocent bystander for now at least

i think jin upload the viedo  


the preview looks very promising we are gonna get tons of answers


jins and phees suprisingly mild reactions to each other were interesting jin is definitely giving off vibes might not be right in the head


why on earth is phee still being so sweet to him after knowing the shit he has done also jin should be more upset knowing phee was just using him to know what happened to his bf


its true when they say the most dangerous man is the one who has nothing to lose tan really has become my favourite character


i literally watched the entire series rn just the last episode is ending i feel like everyone is so bad that u cannot justify anyone other than phee like he did so much for non telling his dad that he was part of scandal i honestly blame top and tee for all this since there were the ones who broke that camera and framed nom ig it wasnt for that movie or anything i feel like non would have just exchanged his school and also the fact that tannew is just so heartbroken its so sad i feel the like only character that would be given a lil bit of sympathy would be jin ofcno amount of hurt can make u leak a video like that but still he was hurt and non on the other hand was cheating on phee who was nothing but good to him always


nons entire family is less a family of people and more a collection of plot points the show peaked in its first 4 episodes i cant believe im saying this about a show written by the same woman who wrote manner of death and triage
pistachiodonut34


ive watched this show with a lot of fast forwarding all of the horror scenes and the bullying scenes so i know nothing about fluke because up to this point hes seemed completely pointless i know all of the others i know their names and their roles in the bullying the filming etc but fluke seemed to just be there and now hes centre stage which is interestingnon going off on tee is so heartbreaking hes completely right poor kid he didnt do anything to deserve this and hopefully tee feels like the pos he is it is good to know hes not a complete psycho willing to let non be killed but he definitely still sucks


cause of death the heart killers 
that scene was a punch to the gut because he was spitting facts tee intervening on behalf of non because he didnt want to carry that guilt on his conscience but ultimately only delayed the inevitable was poetic to say the least


i had to pause the episode at multiple points to go and take a mental health walk what a rough episode


thats what i have been doing since episode 10


please dont let me down i dont need a happy ending but i need a good ending


at this point there can be no happy ending i just hope they dont make new kill them all next week what a disaster


meanwhile i hope they do lmao im rooting for new


the absolute duality i love that that we can safely root for either outcome is really good

what is a good ending at this point i want to see it too but im not sure what it is anymore


in my villain era


in my villain era
at this point i honestly have no idea how they are going to end this we are barreling towards the end and im at the edge of my seatas long as they dont pull a whisperer im all good
i did like they focused on tee in this episode they gave him more depth and hummanized the moral ambiguity of everyone in this series is so well done
no sexy time or scary time this go around but
4100  makeout with white and tee


cause of death the heart killers 
the whisperer did the last episode finally come out
im starting to brace for the fact that the police will find a camera and its gonna be find footage on how they all died


in my villain era
the whisperer did the last episode finally come out
i like youre ending huntress that would be a great one texas chainsaw massacre styleand or its all in news head like the ending devils chair


cause of death the heart killers 
the hallucinogens might be kicking new too thats a possibility 

nope it didnt come out i have notifications on for their youtube channel i feel like im waiting 84 years for that episode 


didnt new delete and turn off everything

cause of death the heart killers 
tee sucks big time and i cant begin to explain how fed up everything he did to non was keeping him alive was more about his own conscience and not about what was best for non and then they sucker punched us with tees origin story and grey characters have never been better although this episode seemed to throw that theory to the drain i still hope a last plot twist with white ugh that kiss on the stairs was so cute
now non is dead and ive never felt so sad for being right his little note left me with a heartache that i cant explain i pumped my fist when phee told new he loved non he always will and now that he knows what hapoened he can move on unlike new who really is out for their heads
i think we can fairly say that the ending next week wont be a happy one
please if anyone can translate thr sticky notes on the board phee new were actually the meme


bocs cinematography
i legit shed tears at that shot of the burning note falling through the black sky what a gorgeous heartshattering shot


cause of death the heart killers 
the im not a loser bit how fed up it is that some of that otherness that non felt must have been his sexuality and tee instead of relating to bim threw hom to the wolves 
edit happy cake day may you have a reddit blast today 


pors mom sucksssss all of the adults on this show are abhorrent its like a roald dahl novel
yeah thats a great question i mean i still dont understand why non was targeted and bullied the way he was why did they call him greasy
maybe it was nons sexuality that the group hated him for despite jin and and tee also being secretly queer i guess we never found out if por fluke or top are queer or straight so if they are straight and jin and tee were closeted at the time it could be homophobia that motivated their bullying
non wasnt poor and he is also good at school and physically stronglarger than some of the other boys i get that his personality was a bit alternative so maybe thats why he was picked on being weird hard to say


bocs cinematography
oh thanks i didnt even really realize it was cake day hahaha i was too focused on typing about this masterpiece of a show


it didnt seem like non had an ounce of sleep food or water he was so weak like starved like how can they expect him to be an indentured servant working like a mule when he was so weak normally you hear those nasty mafiabrothel people tend to take care of you while adding to your debt oh medicine bandaids etc thats going to cost you 100x the price of it and it will be added to your overall debt so that his debt never ends


cause of death the heart killers 
sammon always guts me i know i can stomach murder but when she goes into human trafficking it becomes so triggering to me


the start of the episode was soooo hard to watch it was so sad then just having nons storyline just all in my face at once with non struggling throughout was just sooo sad tees storyline was rough rough rough i couldnt even ship him with white who btw i love them together and i think white is perfect for tee who is always soooo inlove with white it was just soooo sad all around


cause of death the heart killers 
it was just soooo sad all around
facts i dont think white will get over this its too much 


if any of them even survive new has lost all his grasp on reality


cause of death the heart killers 
and so is everyone else now that they are hallucinating





the sticky notes are just the guys name  its the first thing i went and looked up


bocs cinematography
 i had to pause a couple of times because i couldnt stop crying and im someone whos considered aloof with thick walls built around me so thats not typical for me jjay fucking killed me this episode when his dad cupped his face and then started laughing about his grey hair my heart broke especially after perths character said paraphrase in this life if you have to choose you choose yourself tee has never chosen himself even when we see him being completely wrong with non and non was absolutely correct to hate him for it but he got into this life to help his dad and he refused to leave non behind and then in the present hes willing to put himself in front of a bullet for white what a heartbreaking fucking character hes done wrong and should be punished but hes so nuanced and messy and he really is trapped in that life when he burned nons note and it floated away it was such a gorgeous shot but my heart was shattered
 oh fucking hell white was tees salvation he told himself he didnt deserve love and then here came this beautiful boy and insisted on pushing himself into tees life so there isnt some big mastermind there where white is an evil twink i kinda would have lived but how we see that white was a glimpse of the life that tee wanted like how he yelled at his father  he just wanted to be a normal happy kid i feel like hes also going to wind up being tees end tee will sacrifice himself to save white and the only goodness he was able to scrounge out of life
 white must be ill we saw him hallucinating those boils and then he sees tee being disgusted by him when his fear is revealed
 phee and new show how different justice and vengeance are they may have had the same goal as the truth but new is ready to burn the world phee is his fathers son  hes not a murderer new is doing an extended suicide he never wanted to come out of this alive and now that he knows non is dead there is no going back after this he wanted the truth but new has pushed this whole thing to the point of insanity
 i was really hoping that non would come back alive but i guess that was too much to ask for considering how fucking deep into hell he was just like perths character said  there is no going back once youre in that life but i still am holding out hope that someone bought non and uncle joe was just saying that to keep tee out of the business and how did uncle joe die
 i dont know if its coincidence or just because its a popular spot for local teenage boys but that stairwell where white and tee kissed was the same area where we saw phee and non kissing
 a lot of things seemed to be answered this week but i still have more questions so it doesnt feel like the last episode is just going to be round up and i still wonder if jin is going to be the final girl just like in the short movie and hell be the only one running out of that house alive

i agree with you completely also tee was just a kid he was trying so hard to not have any feeling so he could survive he had no support at all much less from an adult he was so invisible to everyone especially his friends i dont think he even realized that non could actually get hurt until it was far too late tee is not good but hes not bad either he really is the definition of gray before the episode started i said to my husband that i hoped they were going to be able to keep up the pace of how good this has been and not fumble it in the last episodes and so far so good tee was one of the more mysterious characters and i feel completely satisfied with his arc and poor baby white when he says i didnt even want to come and you see the enormity of guilt in tees its shakespeareanigly tragic so is the fact that news entire family is dead this has hands down been the most intense bl ive ever watched


bocs cinematography
i think its really beyond bl now this is honestly one of the most intense shows ive ever watched just the spiral into insanity of how we got here

happy cake day 


fudanshi
i was thinking greek tragedy while watching those scenes


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i noticed that about the stairwell and was wondering the backstory of the official gay teen hookup spot 


fudanshi
agreed these characters are so messed up while still pulling at your sympathies for the terrible circumstances they have been forced into


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
woof that one was tough despite everything i do feel bad for tee hes also being taken advantage of and abused that being said non was right with everything he said and tee doesnt get to resolve himself of guilt because it was such a long time ago it was 3 years not 50
it was really interesting that tees father was suffering from debilitating mental illness not physical illness that forces tee to have to support them it made me feel so much worse for tee and how trapped he is
poor white seems like he really did just get caught up with the wrong group and now is going to be emotionally traumatized for the rest of his life which may end up being like 2 more hours
pors mom sucksssss all of the adults on this show are abhorrent its like a roald dahl novel
does anyone else think that non may secretly still be alive i know its a longshot but maybeeeee
anyway im sad now so im gonna go watch the pheenon falling in love montage 8 times in a row


i kind of think he is still alive but also i dont think he should be im starting to think this is all fakea dreamthe movie theyre actually making


i cant belive por said that about tutor kang he was correct


this i saw a reaction video where the actor playing kang said he was good and i was like um no i was worried that in thailand that wasnt considered grooming pors comment brought me relief


rwrb ofc bmftms
the most ironic thing is that that phrase was said by a person who despised non while the two boys who were supposed to love him were the first to judge him and turn their backs on him

king shit stanning tan forever tbh
tho boc really is on another level i was totally swooning over teewhites blossoming little romance 


tannew they can never make me hate you


bocs cinematography
newtan has truly become the scarecrow hes in his arkham asylum era
i honestly wouldnt be surprised if this whole thing ends with them all dead but tbh i really want white and phee to come out of all this alive and as ok as one can be in this situation people are hating on phee a lot and like i agree that him liking jin is bad and like def a betrayal considering jins involvement with everything but i dont think him turning on new was something to hate on like phee is a genuinely good guy so its pretty in character for him to not want to kill people he wanted people to confess and then go to the authorities with that info phee wants justice new wants revenge they should all go to prison for a long time except for phee white and new who should get mental health help instead because while he killed people he didnt do it while in a clear state of mind anyways im hella excited to see how the series ends although i cant believe we have to wait a week 
side note the acting is so good holy shit they are doing an amazing job


i was genuinely surprised with all the hates towards phee where was that coming from sure he pushed non away when he needed him the most but like his reaction was kind of valid it mustve hurt him so bad seeing his lover had sx with other person and later find them hugging and comforting each other people seem to forget that non reassured him that theres nothing going on with the tutor non hides things from him which is understandable because he doesnt want to drag phee into this mess but phee wanted to be relied on he wouldnt mind getting involved in whatever that happened in nons life because he truly does care and love non i dont blamed him for his reactions at that time he didnt know non was already on the verge of breaking point at that time and he unknowingly pushes non further with his rejection it was sad yeah he did catch feelings for jin in the process so people might see this as betrayal towards non but then he rejected him after realizing he might actually be cheating on non but now its been three years he really just wanted to know the truth to find closure and moved on with his life phee protecting jin and wanted to save everyone whoever left was on brand of him he always has this savior complex plus he never signed up for things to escalate this much new pretty much blindsided him after the final seeing how even in his hallucinations he wanted to be with jin after everything kinda pissed me off because why would you still want to be with someone whos directly involved with nons miserable ending and this is the only thing that i would never defend him for lol i guess this shows his strong desire to move on and to start fresh other than that he was such a sweetheart really i dont think his character should warranted so much hate

omfg 

i rewatched the first few episodes the other day and went through the discussion threads here for that its so cool to see how the discussion and audience has grown so much this whole show was a risk to make but it just goes to show that a good plot and acting can draw in an audience

this episodes wow i knew it wasnt likely but i still wanted to hope that non was alive tee did a lot of stupid shit that led to this whole mess but just like non hes just a kid between dealing with his uncle and taking care of his father hes been in survival mode for a long time hes not a bad or evil person but tee has definitely forced himself to ignore red flags and refuse to feel regret in order to survive
it looks like the finale will force everyone to confront their fears i wonder who will make it out alive


i cannot wait to find how its gonna end im very impressed with dff so far


god i cant believe the final is almost here theres still so many questions left unanswered just of the top of my head
sorry in advance for how scrambled this is
what happened to tees uncle
why was the masked killer wearing crutches in some of the early scenes
who was keng talking to on the phone could it be related to perths character somehow
and whats the deal with perth anyway i dont think theyd just introduce a character like that so late in the show if he didnt have a role to play also im a crazy or does he kinda look a bit like white
then theres also the dropped axed from last episode which the camera lingered suspiciously long on and the marks on the trees
also does anyone else think we might have another white twist coming up its kind of suspicious that he just shows up immediately after non is found dead and the boils whats up with that sex work organ trade
oh and is non actually dead or could someone maybe perth have helped him fake his death
edit they also keep emphasizing how smart white is which is also kinda 


yes there was someone else in costume when they first arriaved with non there to make a movie and none of them was under a influance of drugs so who was it
i am still expecting that there will be a nine person in the house when poor got impaled there was someone who cut his arm and hide a knife inside the house both tan and phee were bussy so it cant be them also i dont think that in first episode the hand that touched tee crotch was a hallucination but real hand instead there is still question who mark the tree that looks like trap to make someone walk in circles like phee and jin

i also think the hand was real and not a hallucination
theres also the time fluke hallucinated that por was choking him to death it begins with the door behind them opening wind blows in and then as por is choking him fluke sees the masked killer behind them when the hallucination ends the door is still open
and right after that scene we see tannew reacting to some sound downstairs i cant remember what it was  a scream a think its also possible that he might have been hallucinating it then out of newtans field of vision we see the masked killer run past the camera
another thing ive been thinking about the bathroom hallucination with top for one thing the masked killer is using crutches  a detail that would be very strange for top to hallucinate then theres the loud breathing from the masked killer at first i didnt think much of it but what if the masked killer is wearing some kind of gas mask underneath that would shield him from tannews wacky cigarette conception later also theres a lot of smoke behind him as he enters the room

another great ep love tees backstory you really get an understanding of why he did everything he did and i love how he suffered lol and how non never forgave him and he is still living with all this guilt even after tee busted his ass trying to save nons life put himself in front of his uncles guns and goons got a part time job to give all his money to non checked on him at teh club defended him to customers got his own pay docked for nons mistakes etc like you really got a sense that tee was trying to atone even as he was telling the story back to the guys he never defended himself or tried to paint himself out to be like well i tried and portopetc was worse so i really buy his guilt and his attempt at atonement also the actor did an amazing job im convinced hes the best actor in the cast sans barcode
love manic pixie dream twink white walking into tees life and giving him hope and humanity and light again love that white seemed interested the second tee stood up and was confirmed tall lmao same i am still rooting for whiteperthnon revenge of the twinks who also took down uncle in the background plot but i doubt itll happen
im trying to mitigate my expectations by telling myself next ep is just going to be all of them having their own guilt hallucinations then the narrative will forgive them new will be punished for his wanting vengence and pheejin will live happily ever after but im dreading it new sweetie i am still rooting for blood too
i am so unsatisfied that jin is just going to coast through a punishment for what he did he doesnt even seem that guilty that he posted the tape its like he really believes his excuse that he told phee that he was mad at non for nons boyfriends sake which is such bullshit this ep did such a good job of showing tees regret and even had por of all people point out that the tutor was pure evil for preying on a student  the narrative knows that the kengnon situation was predatory and awful so why wont it properly punish jin there have been no moves made to see his attempt at redemption or penance its driving me nuts i want to see some bone shaking guilt crying screaming that we got with tee and some action for once on jins part alas i fear main ship plot armor really will protect jin and hell just get the guy phee you punk ass traitor and move on with his life ugh still excited for the last ep tho


the reason why you dont see any guilt from jin is because he doesnt actually feel guilty yea he doesnt like that he played a part in nons death but he thinks what he did isnt as bad as what tee did which is funny i think with this eps i can kinda see tee in a better light i still dont like him and think hes a bad guy but its clear to me that what he did wasnt something he did to hurt non in particular what tee did to non couldve happen to anyone even white if the time was different jin on the other hand made nons life worse on purpose what he did was targeted and would not have happened to anyone else we can tell all of this by how he hes been reacting to all of this info coming out when phee tells him whats really going on he yells at phee as if he an innocent bystander and then when he confess about what he did he makes it seem like it was a small thing notice how when everyone finds out that non is dead everyone is reacting is some way and jin is just unconcerned no anger no sadness just worried about himself even white who didnt know non from what we know felt something for non but jin hes just concerned about himself imo im ok with whatever happens as long as jin gets his punishment all the purely evil black and white characters have been killed except for him im not a big fan of him getting away with everything while people whove done less have gotten worst outcomes


if por of all people pointed out the truth about keng its a little odd that the writers wouldnt have a nice guy like jin showing any guilt or remorse over his actions he admits to having filmed the video but he doesnt really seem sorry about it which contrasts against tee who tries to help non multiple times this episode out of his own guilt im holding onto a shred of hope that jin actually helps non in some way theres a couple shots where only jins reflection is visible hinting that he might be lying about something but that doesnt explain why hes moving to america he also says non must really love keng  does he still believe non isnt a victim of grooming its honestly bizarre to see tee silently shedding tears when non confronts him while jin appears to be mostly unaffected and hasnt cried for anyone but his own broken heart at this point i cant tell if the show is going to rebuke jin for his actions if hes still part of some unknown plot or its discreetly endorsing the lack of consequences for his behavior


if their intention is for jin to come out of this show as the main pair final boy hero then they really did not think his writing through they should have never had him playing entitled nice guy if they never intended to explore his guilt agreed so much on your comment


the last non scene was so depressing i liked how non talked to tee poor boy till the end he believed he didnt have anyone in his corner


ghasedakx6


i cant wait till next week i bet all our theories were wrong and it will be a simple ending i just want a good ending not a happy ending


bocs cinematography
i dont think a happy ending was ever in the cards the writers even said it wasnt a romance i saw someone on twitter say that this is a dead dove dont eat show that people are trying to shoehorn into a romance


i just dont want any pheejin ship affecting the ending i feel maybe they want to promote them as the it couple for later project and want to emphasis on them
but i believe in the production

you betta clock

so por ended up being the voice of reason by calling keng evil i didnt see that coming phee turning the gun on tannew was predictable tannew not giving a damn was the episode highlight i dont care about your fcking ethics then he had plan b it turned out he lied to phee about marking the laced ones with an x what is the plan now though next week they seem to be living out their worst fears phee being responsible for nons death jin either seeing kengnon again or himself being filmed tee loosing white
i have no idea how its going to end but white must survive imagine just stumbling into this mess of a friend group the teewhite scenes were cute but tee is still an asshole if he hurts white like the preview suggests i will riot

i hope tee and jin gets their due punishment for real

ngl kinda procrastinated on this bc its the 2nd to last ep and i dont want this show to end but i gotta find out how white fits into this whole puzzle and whether phee will succumb to the drug new has been fucking around with and whos gonna be next on deaths list
ya know for someone surrounded by gang activity who concocted a somewhat elaborate scheme to save tops ass and fulfill his criminal uncles demands tee is pretty damn naive ma boy you yourself threatened non w selling his organs if he ratted you out to the cops you had to know that this wouldnt be an idle threat coming from your uncle right and iirc your uncle never actually promised that hed let non live in the first place what the fuck else did you expect to happen non even calls him out on it baffled why tee would send him to die only to save him at the last second and why hed put non through all this just bc he didnt want him in their friend group
at first when non is railing at tee i thought barcodes delivery was weird and i couldnt tell if he was laughing or crying or what and then i realized towards the end that it was both it was a mocking derisive laugh mixed with crying and all overlaid w wheezing bc hes been beaten so badly that he cant actually get enough air to properly scream at tee barcode the actor youre growing up to be is such a relief thai bl needs more talent like you
love how everyone else is also calling tee out on his hypocrisy even nameless gang twink
so has tee been skipping school to work more to help non w his debt i would see this as more of a redemption if he hadnt had a million opportunities to get non out of this previously hold up so they all know that tee drugged nonwhy tf are they still considering tee a friend and trusting him why is he still in their group long after non is considered gone for good like do none of them know about tees connection to shady characters i get that at this point por and jin still dont know that non was framed for the camera breaking nor do they know that tee was the one who got non to do the horse accounts to get the money for it but they have to suspect something right
i dont quite understand how much time is passing here cus non is still pretty banged up but it seems like tees pretty much dropped out of school to work eeeesh what if nons just continuing to be beaten ugh i dont care of theres enough baht in that envelope to make kinn blush it doesnt make up for what youd done to the totally innocent kid for absolutely no fuckin reason
see i say that then they immediately show us how tees been unfairly parentified and the way that forced him into his uncles claws i justno it doesnt make what hes done to non excusable not in any sort of way whatsoever i know people in real life who were forced into some pretty awful situations and had to grow up fast like that but they still didnt frame a kid they barely knew and pull that kid into an even worse situation than their own but i will say that from what we now know that tee has been given very few choices in life and has not been set up to be in a position where he can afford to be generous or empathetic hes in survival mode which is what initiated his decision to use the broken camera to get non into the horse account scam in the first place its not an excuse but it is somewhat of an explanation tho i am a little confused about whats actually wrong w his dad it has to be some sort of mental illness or maybe a brain injury thats left him disabled cus if he were a drunk i dont think tee would be going through so much just to keep him safe
hold up hold up they all knew that non was working for tees uncle to repay his debt from the money he took from the horse accounts ok i feel dumb i thought they knew nothing about it and were just blindly trusting tee and thought non had run away or something but do they know that tee got non into the money laundering in the first place or do they just think that non got himself into a mess and tee is using his connections to help him out im confused about who knows what at this point tho admittedly im probably overthinking it lol
side note what the actual fuck happened to keng was he already sold off to organ harvesters before tee intervened for non is the picture of him leaving w non fake or is that not actually keng
man the whiplash i just had w por first hes a complete asshole for trying to deflect blame away from himself bc if hed just owned up to not taking care of his precious camera like he should have in the first place none of this would have happened he left it in an unlocked classroom with his idiot friends what the fuck did he expect to happen but then he is the only one of the bunch who calls out keng for the predator that he is and how fucked up it is that non is running off w him
huh tee went looking for non at the casino so he must know that the photo is faked to draw media attention away from the uncle i was wondering about that
well fuck did he just succumb to internal bleeding or something i wanna feel more about this but i just cant help feeling like non isnt actually dead yet but if he isnt that begs the question of how hed fake it convincingly to the uncle who im sure has seen more than his fair share of dead bodies
oh the note lookim not ruling out the possibility that non faked his death i mean his own brother conned an entire school and magically became walter white just to make his brothers bullies confess their sins the show is not immune to wild swings but whether its fake or not nons death truly hit me with that absolutely soul crushing note which thankfully confirmed that it had only been a couple weeks burning through the air
of course as soon as tee tells himself he doesnt deserve to be happy the perfect boy just struts right into his life the world is truly not fair sometimes to be totally fair he does resist whites pursuit for seemingly quite a while butso is white truly just an innocent bystander who fell for the grumpy tall dude at his local internet cafe huh i dont know how to feel about that on the one hand it would be pretty contrived for him to also have some elaborate plan of his own or something and not great pacing to wait to introduce it so late in the game its much more realistic to have at least 1 person whos just a pureish soul so they can be the audience surrogate to feel the real horror of the situation on the other it still feels kinda wrong to have him be totally innocent in such a convoluted story he might be the most unlucky of the bunch
its so odd but kind of brilliant to see such a different but similarly framed meetcute love story origins between tee and white as we saw for phee and non its also fascinating to see a glimpse of how if tee hadnt been in such a dire life situation if he hadnt been having to get his hands dirty to survive for so long how he could have turned out so much more like phee protective nurturing a little prone to jealousy would do anything for the boy they love
i still have questions like how did tee take care of his dad when he went to college and if he quit working for his uncle entirely and got by w part time jobs and if so why didnt he do that a helluva lot sooner i hate the whole innocent bambi finally convinced me to clean my life up trope but its good to have at least most of the truth out there finally tho i will say phee and new should probably be reacting more strongly to the confirmation that non is dead i get that theyve had like 3 years now to come to terms w it and from their little murder board they came up with id wager they put at least some of the pieces together before even getting to the house but still i knew phee wasnt going to actually shoot anyone but i dont understand why he just let new toke up on his murder weed like that
for the finale it looks like were gonna get a lot of hallucination scenes so itll be interesting to parse out whats real and whats not of course my biggest question is whether nons really dead or not which the preview isnt helping bc a seemingly alive non is jumping off a building oh theory so the bully gang mostly has an aversion to non helping w their movie and call him greasy and just generally imply that hes very much not popular at their school we know that hed been taking medication and that when he made the boyfriend proposal phee mentioned that non had been through hard times and weve also seen that he may not be the most mentally stable person so id already theorized that perhaps non had a previous mental health crisis that was in public or knowledge of it got spread around school maybe a bipolar manic episode or suicide attempt or severe panic attach and that is why hed gained a reputation as a weirdo at school and been largely ostracized by his parents and classmates what if that scene in the preview is a flashback to that incident or maybe a hallucination by phee where he imagines he was there to stop phee and how different both of their lives would have been hmmm perhaps farfetched but who knows as for the fates of the rest i genuinely have no clue and thats so exciting its hard to imagine any of them moving on from this horrorfest of a weekend not just emotionally but literally people died someones gonna have to go to prison for that unless new somehow also dies and when the authorities come they just lay all the blame on him which wouldnt even entirely be a lie

me when my dff theory is right


my frustration with jin continues to rise i bet he justified his recording of non with tee telling them about non and tutor


bocs cinematography
jin and fluke are cut from the same cloth  bystanders whereas jin tried to play the good guy and fluke just stood back completely passive but i feel like we are going to be thrown a curveball with jins character

bocs cinematography
taking a ffvii rebirth break to focus on my other hyperfixation
i really really hope that this show has an ending thats satisfying it doesnt have to be happy or even what i expect but i hope its at least satisfying honestly though i dont even know what i expect for an ending thats whats so good about this show so far


im confused the preview for next week shows his still alive or is phee hallucinating

i think hes just hallucinating but why did non have the blood on his face hmmmmm


also what was it with the bathroom scene in the preview they have jin witnessing everyones sex scene lol

poor jin


but hallucinating all the way back to the uncle place when we all were at the vacation home it was the same area non and tee had that brief conversation ugh they really shouldnt have given us that preview if we already saw him dead boo tomatoes potatoes 

wow the drugs must be really strong or he really is alive well see 

i dont want it to end  its such a great show wow perth was slaying this episode

anyone knows what this letter says


it was shown in the ep it says im gonna get out of this place im not a loser tee smoking and burning the paper scene

good episode but some things still dont make sense
one of them is why jin keeps seeing a bloody keng when he is hallucinating according to the show all he knows is that keng ran away with non so something is missing there
and watching the first episode there should be a 9th character wearing the mask if non is dead then who could that be in the first episode when por was lured out and got poked plus slashed with a knife both phee and tannew where in the house with others
oh well next week we should get all the full picture hoping for a good ending where everything clicks

bocs cinematography
okay crazy theory i have to get out of my brain so i can sleep its the last week we can have crazy theories about whats going to happen so indulge me
 in one of the lives jet started rambling about top and he started saying something about tops family life and everyone was like bitch are you just spoiling what if tops dad is one of uncle joes goons so tops relationship with tee this whole time has been a mirror of joe and the goons so what if he knows what happened to nons body they never zipped up the body bag so im being delulu that non is still alive i think that top still has a larger role to play here


yo wtf tee am i supposed to feel sorry or what
i hope new succeeds in killing everyone   lbh they all deserve it for several reasons omg
poor white tho
anyways that boy at the casino is the possible new partner of bible right hes gorgeous  im already in love 


bocs cinematography
i think it will probably be bas that will be bibles new partner but i actually really love the idea of perth and bible perth has a sassy energy that pairs well with bibles more quiet energy  that dynamic reminds me a bit of billybabe


exactly i honestly would need time for a biblebas pairing while i can absolutely envision bibleperth 
am i the only one who thinks non isnt dead the note he left behind doesnt seem like a suicide note to me if anything i took it as a hint that he will do anything to get out of this place including faking his death i think perths character helped him do this and got him somewhere safer i just refuse to believe that non would die and that the scene would feel so anticlimactic without us seeing anything happen when non is in the centre of every event that takes place i am placing my bets on him making his appearance in the final ep next week
as to tee i can say that i definitely understand him much better now of course just because his life is shitty he didnt have the excuse to ruin nons but at least i saw why he became the way he was and while yes he did the bare minimum by trying to help non after putting him in this situation it made me sympathize with him more than i could with anyone else of the friend group
so curious to see what will happen the next episode


i also dont believe hes dead the deaths weve seen in this show have all been tied to important aspects of each characters story  from por dying surrounded by his familys wealth to top losing his own free will to the corrupt criminal justice system oppressing people living in poverty like nons parents if he really had died i dont think the show would have just shown him being manhandled into a body bag we dont know what perth or keng were doing during this episode so i think its likely perth and maybe a few other people like the journalists working to bring down uncle joe helped him fake his death and escape



this was a great episode we get a little bit of humanization from everybody even por we get an inside look into tees home life and its tough to watch no kid should have to face what hes going through we dont know how long hes been dealing with it but his struggles remind me of young people who resort to illegal means like dealing drugs to provide for their families and kids who have to look after their own parents and younger siblings
there have been bls in the past that tackled classism but this show integrates commentary on class and morality in a way that doesnt necessarily romanticize it or tug on your heartstrings none of them radiate babygirl energy except white tees character poses an important question can a person make ethical choices in a bad environment with so few options how much does the ability to be morally good and empathetic depend on ones socioeconomic status for those living at and below the poverty line survival and meeting basic needs often takes precedence over larger social issues with moral implications like climate change and foreign conflicts tee and phee share a lot of similarities with scenes in the neon pinklit room and the gardenlake paralleling their roles as protectors phee risks himself and his family to help non with his debt and doesnt hesitate to treat jins injuries and tee shields white with his body takes on an extra job for non and assumes the role of caretaker for his father but while phee has a supportive parent and a comfortable home life tees home life is a mess hes in survival mode emulating the actions of the adults that raised him violence bluster and coercion like an animal hiding their wounds he has a stoic demeanor and doesnt expose his vulnerabilities towards his friends wearing a poker face both at the casino and at school his love for white turns into his salvation  he becomes a more open carefree person that he might have been in a better environment
however tee seems disgusted by non in a way that goes beyond his status as an outsider and avoids him like the plague in the flashbacks i think its possible that he sees his own lowness reflected in him and instead of offering solidarity his internalized stigma and singleminded focus on survival has him working against non and scamming the poor kid instead of richer and dumber targets like por and top this dynamic reflects the phenomenon of lateral violence where marginalized communities harm each other instead of unifying against the institutions and the people in power that subjugated them like por and tees uncle but tee preys on non and sabotages him perpetuating the cycle of poverty and oppression
its interesting that perth and tan deliver opposing beliefs about acting in selfinterest if it comes down to it worry only about yourself and we need to stick together to survive this show was billed as a slasher but it seems to be more like a psychological horror story exploring what obligations people have to help each other if any and the responsibilities that systems and institutions have to serve the people that exist within them each character represents a distinct point on the socioeconomic and moral spectrum por represents the wealthy exploiting and stealing peoples work top is a loudmouthed sycophant trying to stay in pors good graces fluke is a passive complicit bystander hungry to join the ranks of the rich and influential jin while conscientious rarely translates his instincts into tangible action and nons family faces severe financial hardship forced to choose between paying for basic necessities or their eldest sons tuition which leads to the mistreatment and neglect of their younger son in this story the rich just seem to be inexplicably awful users and exploiters tees uncle refuses to cover his brother or brotherinlaws care and pors father capitalizes on the success of his sons film to boost his own reputation his mother disparages nons broken family with a smile
if next week is the finale this show almost feels too short for all the plot threads that are still left hanging who are the masked killers does fluke get into medical school does the pheejin ship sail does new get the mental help he needs how can anybody escape the house without a driver


hoeing for boeing
at this point a good ending would not not be all of them dead maybe white surviving but im sure theyll be able to stick him with something in the last episode too

i am still expecting that there will be a nine person in the house when poor got impaled there was someone who cut his arm and hide a knife inside the house both tan and phee were bussy so it cant be them also i dont think that in first episode the hand that touched tee crotch was a hallucination but real hand instead there is still question who mark the tree that looks like trap to make someone walk in circle like phee and jin i can imagine that in the last minute of the final episode when final girl will think that he is safe there came a plot twist that there always been somone else who want reveange


i feel bad for tee but i cant forgive him for what he did non is dead and his family he ruined all the 4but i also have my doubts non is alive i guess and that note where he says ill get out of here im not loser is sus maybe hes pretending to be dead or ate that medicine from pit babe where charlie did not breathe for 2 hrs and is alive  i dont know im delusional  next ep looks interesting and once again barcode nailed it i also like the guy playing tee hes talented for sure and teewhite chemistry wow im impressed 


after this mess this episode was i just have one question who killed tees uncle it was just accidental or a normal death the newspaper said he was found dead in strange circumstances
i find weird just to say he is dead if its not related to the plot


i honestly love how this episode highlighted how no one in this show is truly good or truly bad people make bad decisions or have bad circumstances but its not who they are theyre all awful and all deserve sympathy apart from por


everybody is guiltywhite the only one caught in the crossfirehope you survive this

i am a the only one who think that in according to prewiew tan will probablly drug them all and make them under the influence of drugs and visions of non to hunt each other just like he did to top in prewiew that was leaked last week we can see some of them in the forest when they have a halucination of non and non ask phee if he really want to protect him

you know the way people say if the person didnt die on screen then they might not actually be dead and that theres a possibility they might come back this is how i felt before episode 11 i didnt really believe non was dead because we didnt see him die
but if this show has taught me anything its that they dont show us new characters for no reason a lot of things are deeper than they seem and theres a lot more nuance to the characters we consider to be villains or antagonists now that im finished rambling  this statement might bite me in the ass later but a part of me still doesnt think non is deadwhiiiiiiiiiitteeeeeeeee 

the only real innocent in that bunch qq even if his fear for some god damn reason is being covered in stds like what the hell was his backstory for that to be his biggest fear oo

white and that poor uncle 


bocs cinematography
gay men fearing stds isnt that uncommon also deng was innocent

cause of death the heart killers 
i believe he really cheated on tee during those 2 years


profile badge for the achievement top 1 commenter top 1 commenter
or he might feelthink being gay is dirty


cause of death the heart killers 
they were doing too much emphasis on tee waiting 2 years for him amd then whiye crying that he had had only him

ikr i feel so sad idc about anyone else dying but not sweet white


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
he didnt deserve that


i really liked new and nons last scene for me it was the best moment of this episode he needed that i dont mind him being dead at the end cause there was no life after all of this


bocs cinematography
he was never coming back this was extended suicide he had nothing to go back to new got what he wanted and even getting shot is kind of what he wanted he got nons forgiveness and he can be with his family again


yeah i really liked when non thanked him overall the best outcome for new


cause of death the heart killers 
there was no life after all of this
sadly true 


profile badge for the achievement top 1 commenter top 1 commenter
deep sorrow thats what i felti was in tears

man i am actually so impressed with the ending of the show because they constructed it in a way that allows people to kind of headcanon what they want from it you can either think of it as phee and jin got out but what happened with non will always haunt them and tee is a miserable mess just like his father was or you can believe that they all died there theres also the possibility that the ending is the three of them still there hallucinating and they havent actually escaped yet
so much heartbreak i havent done anything becomes so much more meaningful
new losing sight of what non would have wanted doomed him in the narrative but they also alluded to what a lot of fans wanted with non thanking him a hallucination nons ghost up to the viewer
i think its going to take awhile for me to take all of this in there are some dropped plotlines and unanswered questions but im pretty satisfied with it

this is a very traditional horror and a brilliant one at that they did an amazing job the whole way through honestly if it wasnt for the bl which really should not be a factor but in a still largely homophobic world is this could be a mainstream horror gem even with the bl this could easily become a horror cult classic its absolutely brilliant well told story great actors the right amount of misdirection and intrigue it was great from a horror perspective


in my villain era
this is a very traditional horror
100 agree this was a very horror ending i can think of half a dozen horror media that end with that twist its a very common one the decent popped into my head well the one ending is this a dream or are they dead
as an avid horror fan i liked they kept the tropes it didnt matter it was bl that had no bearing on the plot at all the focus was the story and i was invested

they acted their socks off this episode especially barcode who had to die in some gruesome ways that scene with him in the bathtub jesus
new smoking and smiling with them all passed out around him was probably my favourite scene
anyway i guess non called it i loved it personally perfect horror ending


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
good point they really telegraphed the ending there


oh my god i forgot about this just got chills its like all that happened later was exactly how non scripted it out


just so everyone knows boc did actually issue a trigger warning for blood for once so uhhhh good luck guys


hehim
it was definitely bloody im traumatised

god forbid a horror series to end with a closed ending like we dont have to do the open ending every time for this kind of genrealso i feel like its kinda rushed a bit like half of this ep could have happened in ep 11 and the rest for this one plus some extra scenes to have a more cohesive ending but thats just me


fudanshi
agreed the end pacing felt like the creators wanted to have their big bloodbath episode more than tell a cohesive story


yeah it was like they started the series with horror changed to thriller and created a lot of potentials for cool twistsreveals and then were like psych back to horror

sammon isnt the only one involved theres also the horror writer and i think he was the one more in charge of the present eps than sammon theres a distinct different feeling between the two


bocs cinematography
its not an open ending phee and jin are trapped in purgatoryhell they never left the house

its 100 ambiguous because it just depends on how the viewer wants to interpret it thats how its an open ending



i am gagged by this finale i was ready to throw hands at the time skip because it just felt so abrupt right after all the carnage that happened in the house but that ending really brought me back and im really satisfied by the openendedness of that last scene i dont think this show was ever meant to have a truly happy ending and im glad sammon didnt try to subvert my expectations
the hallucinations between all the guys were so visceral and brutal  all their guilt fear hysteria and anger culminating into those scenes of mass murdermutilation was honestly rough but secretly satisfying to watch if youre squeamish then the last 5 minutes would probably be the only part of the episode without a trigger warning
overall i applaud sammon for bringing this genre into bl and sticking with a nontraditional ending for bl though im sad white had to die  he just wanted to hang out with his bf and his friends and he ended up in the crossfire of a crazy revenge plot instead
either way i look forward to seeing sammons future works and the works of these boc boys as well  theyre all so talented


white didnt even want to come on this dumb dumb trip to the woods with no wifi normalize staying home for a me weekend and surviving



in my villain era
this is it gang we are in the finale
this has far and away been the most popular thread ive hosted thanks for making this a blast its been fun to speculate but all i hope is the finale is wild and we get a twist or two and hopefully some spice
will come back and edit with timstamps for the chickens and perverts 
edit uthebookhuntress upheonixs1518 you absolutely right cannot do timestamps this whole episode is one giant timestamp so ill do trigger warnings
 gore blood suicide drug use sexual assault explicit violent imagery
im alright with the ending that was a very traditional horror ending its not an original horror ending its a pretty common trope that the end wasnt really the end and they were still in it decent truth or dare etc
loved the ride though that first 25ish minutes was everything i want in a horror finale just everything


bocs cinematography
according to what ive been hearing youre gonna be busy with those timestamps lol

naw no way to do timestamps on this shit lol


cause of death the heart killers 
facts just a huge red flag all over
i just read on boc fb profile that next week they will release a pecil episode but i dont know what kind


biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
im so glad they let us know lol


in my villain era
i had no idea what it said but i figured it was a warning its a good indicator when to skip ahead


hehim
okay so i just finished watching it and what the actually flip

right like i thought the house was gonna blow up after the lighter sound 
like that is all after all that happened we just leave it up to interpretation 

what the actual flip is right


hehim
the beginning scenes were fucking crazy enjoyed them though but the ending was so bad it ended with a shitty cliffhanger




lmfao white noooooooooo he really did just sign up for a nice little nature retreat with his bf 


what in the actual f did i just watch  this series was so out of my wheelhouse but i liked it and stuck with it i had no idea what to expect and that ending was something i never would have guessed lol
for the record i dont think there is some big white conspiracy he has no back story because he only existed to add to tees story he was young and flirty and tee obviously had a jealous streak so maybe thats what his hallucinations were about that tee thought he cheated even though he didnt but it all just existed so tee could kill the person he loved most
crazy
copper is beautiful and im sad we wont be seeing his face anymore gl to him in england i bet they all had so much fun making this
types olive oil stained broken hip
i dont want to watch it with the news copper is going to study abroad my copperta ship is sinking before it even got started


what is it true oh so sad they had good chemistry


hes going to england for 2 years to finish college so maybe in 2 years hell be back but i wouldnt hold tight to the tacopper ship

kpinhiding



biblezeepondnlmgkpifylita
who else yelled what the fuck out loud when the final credits came on the screen
i expected phee  jin to make it tee was a surprise though that i dont understand
butwhite why poor white
eta so maybe none of them made it im so confused lol


im going w none of them making it through because it makes the most sense

unpopular opinion i honestly like the end cuz i was thinking the same thing as phee like their flash forward didnt make any sense cuz like if they had theyd prolly all be in prison or something but i also like the fact that we dont know for sure that the 3 we thought survived actually died which means i can head canon phee getting out alive and ending up after years and years of therapy being happy even tho there is no way that that is what happens but let me be delulu ok idk i feel like its also a good metaphor for trauma and guilt and all that it is however the type of horror that scares me the most not knowing if reality is real and all that so i am now quite certain that i wont be able to sleep for a few days
overall i think it was an insanely well done series and the acting was amazing also i appreciate the constant trigger warning throughout basically the whole episode it definitely needed it
edit also thinking about it new basically got his happy ending the last thing we saw him see was non moving towards the light and being satisfied and grateful for news revenge new never planned to come out of this alive so this was his ideal ending the more i think about the show the more i like the endings for each character except for whites ending although it made sense for tees ending but the whole whites fear being that tee accusing him of cheating rly confused me like i did think at one point that he was probably a sex worker but i feel like they should have developed that more if they wanted that to be canon oh well nothing can be perfect so im satisfied with what we got


i liked it each characters fate felt right for me i didnt like the way it was told bc it felt shoehorned in with phee making a very quick assumptionexposition of their fate but ill take it anybody else an absolute sucker for those do you remember how we got here in the first place or howd we get out of here questions that open up a whole pandoras box of psychologicalthrilling questions for the characters just me then
this was barely a bl for me so i never once pegged any romantic pair as making it out hea or idk alive for that matter


bocs cinematography
i also loved the ending i dont think phee got out but you can head canon that he did there was going to be no happy ending and we all knew it unless you were still trying to put this into the usual bl box even the end game couple seemed like they were happy and then the rug was torn out from under them


i wanna start this off saying that this is a theory for those that want a happy ending this is one of the ways that it could of happened only thing really holding this together is my ba in psychology lol sammon wanted this to be a horror route they even gave off how the ending of this show was going to go when they based their short film off of the blair witch project which is a horror movie with a very ambiguousopen ended ending
trauma really does effect people in different wayswith jin i could see him being just fine after all of that his main thing is his obsession with people first non and now phee as long as phee still agreed to be jins he could get overthrough anything shrugs nothing wouldcould phase him to much as long as he has phee phee has basically become his anchor to reality and stability
phee is a little harder he gets caught up in things quickly and becomes consumed it seems with what he gets caught up with that he seems to push all of his issues down to the back of his brain till he doesnt think about them anymore and then they start popping up out of no where shrugs this is one way i can see the ending happening they got out but with phee not having fully dealt with everything and keep suppressing it all at that time of the lake it kind of all popped up and he got set off cause it was a spot that involved him and non heavily biggest thing with phee i can seetell is that he suppresses almost anythingeverything negative that happens to himaround him instead of dealing with it basically them at that lake triggered phee with a hallucination relapse of everything he suppressed about that outing to stay functional
them not knowing how they got out or anything involving them leaving can be caused by the hallucinogen you can have a short term amnesiamemory lose after how huge of a doseantidote they took back n forth combating all of it and with pors parents really the dad only cared about his image theyd easily be able to cover all that shit up and just move on lol
another way to view this i am not claiming credit for this this is from someone not naming them unless they want to be known who added a theory onto what i just wrote
also if they really are stuck in the cabin but theyre in a delusion where theyre happy and togetherthats not so bad like even seeing non drown himself occasionally was more shocking than devastating either way it could be worse they either left and are ok or theyre stuck but happy together 
adding onto what they wrote i could see phee having those delusions for the rest of his life with how much of the chemicalhallucinogen he ended up inhaling both during the cabin and as new and him were working on it it could of became something that will just always happen on and off his face along with jins werent shocked that he started walking towards the water n phee seeing non was more just startled


both of these theories are perfectly plausible in this universe before the question as to whether or not they left the house at the end in my mind phee was just having normal hallucinations no biggie he can live with that 
and the 2nd theory is pretty much like love for loves sake i completely and wholeheartedly believe they are in that alt universe happy

bocs cinematography
edit i see a lot of comments and people saying its a cliffhanger or will there be a season 2  its actually not a cliffhanger phee and jin didnt get to live a normal lifethey never got out of that house they have to live in purgatory forever or the last moments of their lives phee had to watch non drown himself hes stuck there watching non die over and over again knowing that he couldnt save non or jin
im in fucking agony and i have to go to work after this i knew that we could never get a happy ending but not like this not like this i saw so many vaguetweets about how people hated what people were doing and that the end sucked but i think it ended perfectly for what it was we even got that the end game romance of any other bl was them stuck in purgatory forever everything was so very poetic justice and perfect revenge horror a
 new was never coming out of this alive this was always an extended suicide for him hes no longer new  hes full jonathan crane that opening shot of him dancing with the gas could fit straight into a batman comic even if phee hadnt shot him how was he supposed to go back to regular society after this he was on the path of no return hed killed two innocent people when it had the flashes of deng and white i was just overcome with a swell of emotion he gets to be with his family again he got what he wanted revenge at the cost of everything
 jesus fucking christ tee again i knew that there wouldnt be a happy ending but not like this all his actions led to this moment he ruined nons life even if he didnt mean to just like he finally found happiness but he still destroyed it with his own hands even if he didnt mean to jjay fucking killed it i really want to see him in more stuff post haste i felt my stomach roiling when it had the cuts between tee and whites hallucinations because of the mounting dread of the tragedy we were barrelling towards
 fluke losing his eyes that he used to see anything but didnt do anything against
 top in the circle of judgement of his friends how they were just looking at him like he was some moron
 jin stabbing and stabbing his fapping hand for a lack of better term that was the hand he used to film non and keng that was the hand he used to masturbate to non in the flashes we saw he wanted non for himself and his jealousy led him to the video
 phee stuck in purgatoryhell watching non die over and over again because while he tried to find out the truth he was never able to find non and save him and he wound up getting to comfortable in a life that was a lie he got too comfortable with jin and now hes trapped there with him forever or the last moments they are alive that are stretched out to an eternity psychically
edit 2 there is a chance that tee phee and jin survived but they wouldnt be normal pors dad or one of their men would eventually come to the house to find them after not hearing anything for a while and find the scene tee would still be in the throes of mania like we saw in his bedroom in the fake future phee is stuck in a loop of seeing non die over and over again and jin could be alive but if hes still stabbing himself would probably die of blood loss even if they did survive pors dad would make sure they went to prison so even if they do survive there is no happiness here


im dying at the jin stabbing his fapping hand for the lack of better term 


rwrb ofc bmftms
flukes end was truly poetic justice he witnessed the two key moments that sealed nons fate but he preferred to ignore them even though deep down he knew of the consequences of neutrality 
from newtan i loved that while the others were tormented by non he found peace and he was able to reconcile in his own way with his brother and receive his gratitude for a moment i feared that they decided to make nons ghost reproach him for his revenge and new died regretful

i think the ending is just intended to be ambiguous so that viewers can take what they want from it if a viewer wants to believe that the boys escaped but non will always be haunting them and tee is miserable then they can if a viewer wants to believe they all died there they can if a viewer wants to believe theyre still hallucinating but could escape they can
though i will say i dont know that phee and jin would go to prison because they didnt actually do anything but again thats up to interpretation which i love about this ending people can make of it what they want


bocs cinematography
the crime scene is such a mess and everyone was high out of their minds that a prosecutor could easily get charges dropped or lessened they would probably get charged with a lesser crime like assault but i think a murder charge would be hard to prove in a court of law in this case


rwrb ofc bmftms
i wonder if the cameras they hid are still recording since the original purpose was to have proof of the confession they wanted to obtain


i immediately came here when i finished it question is there a season 2 planned or something or like a special episode cause thats the feels i got im 
otherwise i liked it i didnt  it but i wanted some bloody carnage and i got nobody got a happy ending which im fine with
dont come for me with this one but i didnt feel a thing when white diedi just got detached from his character when we launched into the flashbacks it sucks though cause i loved him and fluke episode14 the separation didnt make my heart grow fonder unfortunately sorry
my eyes were rolling big time in the last 10mins in fact i was yelling dont do this show but im glad they flipped it it was shoehorned for sure but i wasnt going to be ok with pheejin living happily ever after while tees sufferinggone fruit loops phee will forever hallucinate about non as he should i him but its right for his character and theyre all forever stuck there either living or dead it feels right to me ya know plus they ask the ultimate question imho who sufferssuffered more the living or the dead id rather die personally
news ending was the bestworst for me mio rocked everything like a frickin boss and you could tell he was having a good time a big part of me wanted him to have his vengeance but i knew he and non his parents was going to be a tragic figure in all this 

oh also copperjin is going overseas to continue uni so he wont be around to do a second season


cause of death the heart killers 
hes leaving at the end of the year right theres still time to squeeze in something but i doubt it will be s2 or a special episode i kinda dig that sammon went all the way horror here no need of hea how could there after that bloodbath those who remain might need therapy for life


bocs cinematography
ahhhhhhhhhhh
we will finally know which theories are correct me and my friend keep thinking that its going to end just like the short movie ended  with jin being the only one left it looks like were going to go right into the plot of the short film in this episode where each person sees the masked figure but the figure is different for each of them which is true because they are all hallucinating something different

i am so overwhelmed i really hope they got all the boys therapy after this especially for barcode

i really liked that ending especially the way what we learned about everybody throughout the past few episodes starting ep 5 really came to really haunt them in their last moments like i love that fluke who was constantly witnessing things top breaking the camera jin taking the video but never speaking up about them gouged his own eyes out loved tans visions as well to him he was finally a good phi who took care of his nong i was expecting tee to die but the fact that he killed white omg my mouth was agape that whole sequence
the very very end was im choosing to believe this was just like 2 minutes after the massacre not 2 years and theyre all currently dying in that courtyard and phees hallucinating still just an extension of seeing non die in a million ways and he doesnt necessarily even have to have the drug to hallucinate it could be just from the trauma of everything going on


i am confused  spoiler
did white really die or is that the drug influence thingy and they are all just sleeping um i dont know

id say that everyone we saw from the outside perspective the scene where they pan around the room is confirmed dead so yes while anything that focused on one characters perspective like the flash forward is up in the air on whether it was reality or not
thats just my interpretation based on like cinematography story telling stuff ive learned about tho 

it seems some people were confused by the ending the twist is that nobody actually made it out of the house phee and jin were hallucinating maybe they eventually escaped but well never know 

in the end i was hoping non would somehow be alive maybe due to interference by perths character nope perths character didnt really have a purpose to the narrative after all i was also hoping tee would attempt to redeem himself by either killing his uncle or sacrificing himself to protect white white was really the only character i particularly wanted to make it out alive but i would have been okay with a few others living depending on the circumstances
the everybody dies ending would also have been fine but i hated the fake out two years later bit that tonally clashed with the rest of the episode i definitely didnt want phee and jin to end up happily ever after so im glad that wasnt real but the reveal was just kinda dumb sammon loves her last minute audience manipulation tan and bun shooting eachother and falling off a cliff in mod triage pretending like its going to have a sad ending until the last possible minute leaving barely any time for the audience to enjoy the main couple being together and it never quite works for me

types olive oil stained broken hip
this finale was terrible i dont mean badi mean this definition extremely unpleasant they brought the horror angle full circle and its not my bag of chips but gd if they did not do an amazing job with this show i like sammons scripts and i became a fan of more than one of these actors
all that being said
what the flucking fluck was that ending are you kidding me

dear friends this has been a pleasure  see you on the other side

im so sad poor innocent white got dragged into this and ultimately lost his life at the hands of his lover  rip white i feel that ending left doors open for a possible second season but with the news that copper is going abroad a second season wouldnt be the same without him  overall dff is definitely one of my favourite bl shows all the casting was perfect and the acting was superb 



idk what i was expecting but anyway the ending is so disappointing unless they all are doomed which i believe they are bec i went back and saw the episode again and it looks like none of them actually survived 
edit  they all are dead friends forever 

overall not a bad ending i wanted all dead basically well beside white which is sad and the most shocking scene for me
for all those jin supporters out there that forgave jin for filming non now you can get confirmation that jin indeed posted that video
new feeling guilty for that uncle and whites death was a nice touch non was a good kid too once like white he wasnr spare so why should white
i really enjoyed this show it was intriguing and thinking about different theories was fun
i have to give them a for these kids acting


it was a good finale it felt like a cop out a little with how open ended it was but still a great experience overall i had a lot of fun with it and the cast and crew have a lot to be proud of
i like to believe they all died lol so new baby im proud of you you did it hes a little guilty for the innocent people dying which is fair but im so glad they didnt make him feel remorse about any of those other jerks i wish he got a hug from ghost non but ill take the thank you
white sweetie im so sorry you deserved to be canon confirmed final girl sad that white wasnt on the fantasy revenge twink team of perth and non that i had envisioned in my head he kind of just existed to be tees character growth manic pixie dream boy plot device alas but tees subconscious drug state equating white with non fed into my teenon ghost ship so that was fun for me lol
the way i was furious at the two year time skip and seething as jin was like thanks for forgiving me lets move on  like bro lmao jins guilt is so minimal compared to everyone elses even though hes argueably caused non the worst trauma of all of them minus tee fluke stabbed his own eyes out just because he was a passive observer all jin did was stab his hand and then live happily ever after and decide things are fine now i was so mad lol then the last few lines happened and i was like ok ok i can live with this
they really wrote themselves into the wall with jin pheejin is a massively unappealing ship imo and its part because even until the end jin didnt take stock of his sins the way the other characters were forced to do even his sex tape hallucination felt centered on himself not non and his hand stabbing was nothing compared to what all the other people in the friendgroup inflicted on themselves so his comeuppance was wholly unsatisfying until the very end for me plus he still got the guy in his dead person ghost hallucinationfantasy high so it was very vomit emoji for me the writers should have never confirmed that jin was the one who posted the sex tape if they wanted the audience to root for himlike him and then if they didnt want the audience to root for himlike him they should have committed to showcasing his narrative punishment further than they did because it really felt neuteredflat compared to everyone else
im choosing to believe theyre all dead except white who somehow hobbled out idk im gonna miss a lot of these actors so im eager for more from them and i also appreciate boc taking on a risky standard defying genre of bl though i still wish they committed to the journey a lil more than they did great show i enjoyed so much of it and ill probably give it an 85 maybe a 9 on mdl
oh also major shoutout to barcode he impressed me so so much in this role and especially this ep hes mvp of this show and then probably jjay for me another great performance


i was so mad lol then the last few lines happened and i was like ok ok i can live with this
haha same

argh im so torn

i loved this finale this show started episode one by paying homage to slashers and ended in true slasher fashion
in the end non got his revenge at least the revenge the audience and new wanted to see


as a horror fan i absolutely loved the endingbut im confused as to whether tee guy is alive but he became mentally unstable abnormal after that traumatizing event but all the others died 100  i loved it still i needed closure for non did he die of suicide or illness i dont know i fast forwarded through the ep but still did not find more about him anyways kudos to the writers i loved it absolutely 

yall i waited until tonight to watch both eps 11  12 bc i didnt want any cliffhanger but like wtf just happened in ep 12
where did the plot go why did poor bb white have to die instead of tee he didnt even know non 
did they all die what was that ending scene even what happened to keng how did non actually die and when did tees uncle get exposed what about tees sick dad
im so damn confused and that was just it not a satisfying ending at all  

its interesting some people say the ending is amazing some people say its not overall we all enjoyed the journey and i think we all would agree to more bls with horror as the main topic cheers to the series ending

think its cause the last scene cut off too abruptly and as someone who hates open ended and vague things with a burning passion i get them but im not as annoyed this time cause i expected something like this considering there was one episode left and so much to cover i just convinced myself that the ending meant they all died or at least jin and phee didnt get the happy ending they absolutely didnt deserve and are either dead or in a mental institute having hallucinations for the rest of their miserable lives 

i just wanna say i love the ending its everything i wanted from it yes its a classic horror ending but i didnt think they would go there and they did



cause of death the heart killers 
woah props to sammon for sticking to the premise and not bending to the bl rules this ended as it should with lots of gore deaths and no hea we can delulu ourselves but we are stuck in that valley house forever
when i checked the running time i knew we were not having happy
so a couple fo things i need to discuss
did white cheat on tee during those 2 years i think so he wouldnt be hallucinating venereal diseasess boils if he hadnt did he cheat on tee with phee mmm thats more tricky but it felt like they were hinting that right
was jin another victim of keng i think the theories about this are true he was double pissed when he found out about non and keng i dont think a crush on non deserved that reaction but watching your exlover having sex with your current crush might be it
did jin post the video then i was finally on team jin didnt do it because of the light and dark mode of the computers but then it seemed they doubled down on jin being the culprit and that was it this felt not satisfying to me
im salty about white he really was an innocent bystander and wasnt meant to survive now tees outcome the best revenge ngl


bocs cinematography
i dont think jin was a victim of keng i think that was just part of seeing himself as being filmed and thus he was put in nons position i think that the fact that we saw how much jin masturbated thinking of non that he really was jealous and hurt because hed built up such a fantasy of non that he did post the video as pure reaction
tees outcome is the coldest revenge dish ever jjay did so fucking well that i am ruined

jin definitely posted the video and him seeing himself instead of non with keng in my opinion was just him imagining what if he was in nons place being filmed


cause of death the heart killers 
the light and dark mode were misleading i hadnt even noticed at first and then i went down the tumblr rabbit hole and they convinced me i see your point about jin and keng i still believe he went just a tad bit overboard with his reaction but that also explains this kid had these friends for a reason too

i can answer 3 jin def posted the video we see the uploading bar go up to 100 with his mouse hovering over the tweetpublish button then he throws his beer and his computer sends out sparks so we can only really guess if the computer going out like it did made the confirm click that can happen or just straight up died but then we get to the school and the look on jins face when the other kids are watching then looking at them plus the way he shuts down fluke when he tries to speak about it hints heavily that it def happened through his tweet xx
gonna throw out my own ideas for the other questions 
white def cheated on tee or he was a prostitute during those 2 years i cant really think of any other way for his fear of stds to be the biggest thing he fears over all others xx tho him cheating with phee  i cant see that one  my take of phee is that he just got to comfy with jin and ended up falling in love with jin while doing this long con i cant see myself phee sleeping with white during all of this
on jin i think his love of non was more of a complete obsession with him so when he say something he thinks he ownsis his sleeping with someone else he kinda lost it honestly all these damn kids seems to have some mental instability


bocs cinematography
yeah jin was totally obsessed with non the way he jerked off to him constantly and look at the way that he was completely besotted with phee instantly jins a character that latches onto boys so when he saw non with keng he got super jealous like non was cheating on him because when youre obsessed with someone you have scenarios in your head that arent even real

about white death my take is non was innocent too and he wasnt spare so why would white be spare


cause of death the heart killers 
following news logic i get it and it was poetic justice that tee took the person who new loved the most so new took the one tees love the most


 the behind the scenes are hilarious 
anyways i was about to go off that tee survived somehow although he is basically the reason non is dead but looks like everyone is deaddrugged still  lovely well done new well done 
ah yeah big fan of bullies dieing so 

cant wait i want death


when will the new episode come out


14 min in and omg omg omggggggg

i dont really like the ending  i know i know it was never going to be a happy ending but why tf not why couldnt the good people have a good ending phee was good white was good this sucks


in my villain era
it was a very horror ending i was hoping white was the final girl but tbh im low key happy they didnt cop out with the happy endingbut thats the horror fan in me talking not the bl one 


pakin girlie 
i only watched bits and pieces mostly the nc scenes and tbh im glad a lot of commenters here seem happy with the ending but im in bl for the romance and this seems horrible to me

cause of death the heart killers 
ooh we are back on horror territory 

we really are the ending was classic horror leading the audience to think some of them survived only for it to crumble apart at the very last second

even with the antidote smoked by pheeall of them still perished in that villaall of them in their own drug induced hazea fitting revenge for nontheir dff


in my villain era
beulah your comment reads like poem i love it


24 min in and if phee and jin survive i will be mad


bocs cinematography
i dont believe they did
hi i havent been on air in a minute but wow my jaw is on the floor i am baffled perplexed content sad apathetic angry etc etc with all that happened this outcome makes the most sense i like that theres no neat and tidy end because that wasnt the show it was messy and messed with your mind and the truth was always out of reach i think white was the only shrapnel here but even then the boils must have meant something more than we know this was my first 1010 show on mdl jj needs his own series immediately he has so much potential and carried so well just wow this one is gonna stick with me

im left with deep sorrow and unresolved feelings
what is this


captain of the li dongyuanruan lanzhou ghost ship 
i really hope the cast especially barcode had access to mental health services it must have taken a psychological toll on all of them to act out the scenes of this last episode i honestly cant imagine having to act scene after scene after scene of suicide attempts


im sure the show isnt as traumatic as what is portrayed for us to watch as it behind the scenes


i just now wonder who is the person lightning the cigarets in the end like was all that phee had started to see just hallucination to the very end or really tan died and after that he fall again to hve vision of non i doubt that tan scene with non would be just hallucination because it was very emotionl to viewers so who was it tan non phee or just a director hint that the cigarets phee smoked one after another were not a actuall antidox but just different drugs which trap him there 

listenim only on episode 7 lol my bff and i have a watch party every sunday where we watch 3 episodes after work so i have 2 weekends to go before i get to watch episode 12 sooooo im trying not to read the comment thread about to happen herebut why im here already  


okay the hell is that ending should of just left it at phree n jin at the lake without that extra shit at the end 
edit 
like if they stopped it right there the ending would of been kinda good itd of closed things out wed of known what happened to phree jin and tee the 3 we think survived but then they just had to add that bullshit at the end and ruin it vv man


bocs cinematography
the ending is perfect they didnt leave the house there was no normal life phee didnt get to escape seeing non die over and over again they all died new got his revenge for non tee may be still alive but hes so broken that hes exactly as we saw him just on the floor of that house instead of in his actual room phee and jin are trapped in the hell they made

cause of death the heart killers 
cant relate two years was just too little time for phee and jin to bounce back up after what they went through especially jin i was kinda expecting to see his hand at some point he went hard stabbing it with the scissors but there was nothing that seemed sus to me ngl the 2 years after was misleading and was unnecessary of they were gonna bring us back to square 1 or in this case the freaking valley house




ok so here after watching ep 12 all i can say is that the series has successfully come out wid the most unique way of ending it and none of the theories made so far are correct or are they 
i dont wanna spoil i want everyone to watch and leave their thoughts abt the ending
edit i think the ending hints towards everyone eventually being dead inside of that house but if u think abt it another way it culd also be a possibility that none of this is actually happening since the beginning of the show everyone was drugged and theres a high possibility that they r all stuck wid what has been happening in their hallucinations the only part we can actually confirm is true is the fact that these grp of boys have hurt non in some way or other every single one of them has except white we will never know which part was real and which ones are hallucinations because theyve been drugged since the beginning of ep 1 imo the show is a cluster of everyones hallucinations which eventually leads us to the story of non



ok 33 min and im mad lets see if i change my feeling by the ending edit i did change my feeling im happy now


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i am still processing that finale and this series as a whole but it did just become my 100th mydramalist entry on my completed series list
i think i need more hobbies


now i know why they deleted por scene about 9 people being in the cottage o guess there was non


pakin girlie 
i only watched bits and pieces ok the kisses and nc scenes heh and after reading here im very glad i dont think i would qualify this series as bl at all and it definitely doesnt seem like my jam 


in my villain era
it leans harder into the horror than the bl

i had so many questions and none of them were answered wtf i loved it tho


ummm sooo my life is in shambles and im absolutely flabbergasted that they killed off the one innocent little boy hhhhhhhhh
idek how to feel about the ending i would hope we get something more to feel more complete about the ending cause wtf i also wish that phee and jin wouldve ended up together together cause they were perfect for each other
im so surprised that just about everyone died if this is traditional horror i must not watch enough lmao
anyway this show was amazing if my emotions are this affected by it then it was definitely an amazing show 1410


um im so confused but ok a lil disappointed


just watched this i loved the ending actually definitely a departure from the standard bl format which is so awesome i feel like they really pushed the envelope with this one and it was great

that ending left me speechless im so satisfied and dissatisfied at the same time i loved what happened with top and fluke jin got off lightly poor white tho i think we really needed one more episode for all of it to wrap up i still have so many questions  btw did anyone notice how at news last moments when he hallucinated non non was wearing his red bracelet was that a mistake on their part wasnt the last time they talked that scene outside their house i went back and checked and non didnt have his bracelet then im not even sure he was talking to phee at that time so why would new hallucinate that bracelet im kinda obsessed with that thing cause non had it even when he died and that fact haunts me aside from that i feel so bad for how non died thinking no one cared being worked to death and beaten up and how even his body was just towed off


i i will i will talk about my opinion on last ep but i need to heal first



finished everything in two days pheww what a ride if youre looking for typical bl then this was not it it was a horror thriller series with gay characters
i like the ending you can interpret it however you want it could be literally anything and theres no way to confirm what was real or what was not one of the most interesting theory was that all of them might really just still hallucinating new clearly didnt trust phee so he might drugged phee from the start as well and he keeps on smoking that stuff around them so they just passed out and falls deep into their hallucinations trapped inside their worst fears with no way out everything that happened after that was really just some sort of massive layered intertwined hallucinations and even if they got save theres no way they could live normally personally i thought it was worst than death or everything happened exactly like new wanted it to be he has nothing to lose after his parents death so might as well go all out with the revenge poor phee unknowingly got caught up in news revenge plot while all he wanted was to know the truth
ive seen a lot of comments hating on phee sure he was wrong for pushing non but from his pov he saw the video and this was after he confronting non about his relationship with the teacher anyone would be pissed he was hurting so he hurt non with his wordsactions it was wrong yes in the ideal world he would ask and wait for explanation but they were just some 17yo boys whod didnt think stuff through he managed to calm down and willing to talk to non albeit too late theres no way he couldve known that this leads to nons breaking point i mean non did hide things from him he even told him to ditch the group of course im in no way blaming non his family situation wasnt exactly ideal and his so called friends and his tutor took advantage of him he was thrown in this shtty situation thus he makes some questionable decisions the whole situation was sad really
everyone had their shares leading non to his ending especially his group of so called friends if anything i was dissatisfied with the lack of phees reaction to jins confession like shouldnt hed be more idk angry disappointed not to mentioned he really hallucinated about being together with jin after all that bruhhh  but i guess it kinda shows that he really just wanted some closure about non and moved on with his life jin pretending to be morally upright compared to his friends pissed me off when in reality he is just like them and he showed lack of remorse too
if you think about it new was so determined to end it all he probably didnt bring the antidote let alone his inhaler he also might lied to phee so while phee gained conscious he might inhaled more of the drug thinking it was the antidote so from that point onwards theres no way to know which was real did he passed out did he shoot new did he managed to save jin and tee but even if he did he unknowingly drug them again so the hallucinations continues all we know from the ending he actually realized that everything was in his head he seems to have high tolerance towards the drugs so he is most definitely alive and was still at the house and there also the sound of the lighter and someones smoking so im assuming that was new probably high from the drugs id love to have more conclusive ending but cant say i dont like this ending it has this eerie unsettling vibe which match the series
i was actually surprised with the explicit sexual scene it was hot but unnecessary i think also it was super triggering so please watch with caution i thought shadow was hard enough but this series was even more
overall while it was not perfect but as a horror triller fan i thought it was pretty good i would also like to applaud barcode because he nailed his role especially when he goes all psychotic chills i always thought he was one of the weakest actors in kpts but he improved a lot here appreciate boc for producing this kind of series i hope we can get more of this


um thank you phee still remained my favorite even when i was disappointed the friends comments he made in epi 10 12 irked me with him but i didnt have the patience to type it
i still feel hes the one character i could justifydefend the easiest of the bad guys

i also finished this in 2 days and tears are fogging my eyes whilst i am writing this i am so traumatised


i just finished watching dff just now and i was just crying the whole episode the ending was really unique i just felt like my heart just shattered like the actors all did a great job in making me cry i am sorry to white i thought he was involved with non but no he was innocent but it makes sense his name literally symbolises purity but anyways i am still in tears because of how tan or new didnt deserve to die like that the cigarret that had an x on it that tan said that had the extracts was the actually the one that didnt have the x on it tan lied to phee about that fact which explains why him jin and tee are still stuck at the house


omg yes i was right


the flashbacks at 31mins just before the time skip was soulcrushing very aptly soundtracked by jon bjrk  before its gone 


as a horror fan i love it loved the ending barcode really nailed his role his evilish smile was spooky and i loved it all the gore blood was perfect it had an open ending too and i also heard there will be special episode i hope its not behind the scenes but more about nonwhitenew perspective i might sound crazy but new really is a kind brother i wish i had a brother like him


barcode really nailed his role his evilish smile was spooky and i loved it
yassssss his almost laughingalmost crying face was amazing  he must have worked ridiculously hard to find that balance

so the ending was gory and i think the best outcome that nobody got an happy end
but in the end the story did not feel that strong
i get the sense that they already started filming while the ending was not clear yet and leaving it open if there was a 9th person there and if that was non there are still a lot of plotholes unclear
newtan btw was amazing his performance and even the end hallucination were done great up until the end he was convinced what he did was right and no torturing and killing is never ok as it also included innocent bystanders
white sole purpose of being the liberation for tee and then becoming is own personal hell was so good
but jin i had so much hope for this character it does feel like they did not known what to do with him they should have made him darker and have that at least be known to phee him filming and posting non seemed like an actual of impuls based on revenge and hurt which afterwards he felt guilty about this suggest specially his age and the rest of his behavior as more of a really stupid act then him being super bad so why would his hallucination be about him being filmed specially they way they did it to me that did not make sense and then he starts stabbing his own hand why what was the link with his hallucinations if he was going to stab something i would have chosen another body part
oh and if his biggest fear is for his sex acts to be caught on camera why have sex in front of your window or give a bj on a balcony in a house that you know had cameras


i went in nearly blind didnt expect any bl because the horror thriller elements were advertised to me the most i loved it all the way through
i was consistently excited for the next episodes and mind fucked by the ending im sad i finished it so quickly


the ending reminded me of the movie incident in the ghostland where 2 sisters are trapped and tortured for many years and one sister dreams of getting out and having this whole new life as an successful author for 16 years while still being trapped in the house and the sister brings her back to reality and they escape the house if thats the route they are taking then we can expect a season 2 soon where they they try to escape the house


honestly wanted a nicer ending for white

im extremely late but i dropped dff around halfway through ep 4 as it was airing im glad i picked it up again because the flashback episodes were amazing and really caught my interest aside from phee and white i was pretty ok with everyone else dying though

i cant believe the ending was this bad like there was so much potential ruined 


whaaat two years later tell me its them hallucinating


100 nobody got out of that house alivethe director madeaw of the historic and award winning first thai bl love of siam 2007 who also directed ohm in madeaws also award winning dew the movie and then icons of the thai bl series industry maxtul in their last series together which was the first thai bl to break into the mystery and crime genre which was groundbreaking manner of death and manner of death written by sammon now coming back with dead friend forever as a screenwriter authors of novels being involved in the screenwriting is so crucialthese are all good indicators
yes boc had issues and they were rookies but regardless the production of kinnporsche was also groundbreaking
so now these same people breaking bl into a new genre horror suspence gore yet again with actual bl and intimacy given the press release about the parents of the actors having approved the sex scenes makes me assume there will be intimacy it is a copypaste of the press release they put out when kp aired minus the line about the parents  i mean this has got to be entertaining at the very least but important to the genre of bl for sure so i am excited 


in my villain era
helps that its streaming in iq as well im expecting all out gore and nc17 in true horror fashionbarcodes photo placement leads me to think perhaps he will be our final girl but i hope they surprise me


posters are so telling


in my villain era
or he could be the killer as well 5050


true since it airs at the same time as the sign i will watch after i finish the sign and will definitely check the comments here first  have fun


in my villain era
one episode in and i am obsessed were getting an actual horror series and its got the gore and the sex they are hitting all the horror beats and im honestly here for it group of partying friends cabin in the woods communication cut off some dark secret from the pastim not even mad lets go
im digging the killer design too hard to give us a slasher with a good visual concept but im into this one less is more but this is effect and im into the practical effect yess
the premise is straight forward the stage is set and im in
episode 1  timestamps 
so i dont ruin anything   sexy time   scarygore time
150  animal death 
1900  sexy time with teewhite 
2130  explicit sexy time with jinphi 
2610  graphic impalement 
2900 to about 3100  more of our impaled friend they show it a fair few times in that scene 
3700 to 3900  more of the impaled 


i am living for these timestamps 


in my villain era



thank you for your service  i couldnt care less about the horror stuff im actually kinda squeamish so ill gladly avoid the  and focus on the 

i thought tee or white was gonna get offed at that nc scene usually during slashers teens having sex draws the killer out lol


bocs cinematography
well we did get the phantom hand on tees dick though



that was camp mawma


you got me rollin


in my villain era
if it was a movie  that would have been the case but we got 15 episodes to go so we cant be knocking them off too soon my guess is theyre maybe a little infidelity hinted at as well

15 episodes for this show wow i wonder what else is going to come


bocs cinematography
i feel like they were cursed by the first movie since the ones that were there before were the ones that were seeing the ghost and phee white and i believe tan were the ones that werent there last time and didnt see anything so maybe the ones that were cursed were bringing back new people to the place for a sacrifice to non who is possessed by the spirit now like the story por was telling on the car ride up to the cabin well probably see more in the flashbacks since we know that the characters are acting creepy in a school setting
at least thats just my guess as to where it might be going

i love that this his horror first and bl second the location is gorgeous which is par for the course for be on cloud i want to live in this cabin ghosts and all the creepy shrines all around are just the icing on the cake i also like the practical effects it feels very oldschool horror as a true horror fan i was watching the background during that entire bj scene expecting something to pop out they left negative space around tas head which was excellent on the dp  the original friday the 13th did that a lot to great effect  when you leave negative space in a movie where you expect something to pop out all the time it creates tension with the audience especially when it doesnt happen but the tension isnt popped by a jump scare
i also like that the dynamics arent typically bl relationships where its meet and flirt and fall in love we already have an established couple and a couple with a messy history give me more bls and gls with established couples


in my villain era
right its hitting all the traditional horror tropes and im here for it im seeing it going a couple of ways in terms of plot but im gonna let them cook even if its predictable im just happy its an actual horror series


really liked your background info on framing and horror alot of people just think horror is a bunch of jump scares and opening medicine cabinets but done right horror can be absolutely haunting and beautiful
the last thai horrorblish series i watched was shadow which was a major letdown then i ended up rewatching remember 15 which was better but not blow your socks off
really really hoping this series takes the charge forward and blows expectations out of the water


bocs cinematography
jump scares can be effective if used right but most of the time they are used really wrong because they kill any mounted tension by making the audience laugh at themselves for getting caught if you use a jump scare and dont let it ramp down the tension but just as an extra layer of the rampup it puts you really on edge as an audience unfortunately repeated jump scares are the hallmark of bad horror movies
i think they used jump scares effectively here because the quick pop of the ghost or whatever didnt have any moment of relief where the character and viewer could go haha im just being stupid and go back to a normal heartrate
im also just glad to see a horror bl thats not vampires i mean i like vampires but im kinda sick of romantic vampires i want my vamps to be evil predators dammit


cause of death the heart killers 
here for it so here for it just to bring peace to some people the characters in the present day are in their 2nd year of uni so the nc scenes are among adults the cinematography is excellent as boc is wont to have and the kisses the kisses top tier i have the worst headache but i had to watch 


top tier ta learned everything from his bros at kp  i saw tas potential way back when  when he grabbed that back of the head i was sat down and locked in i am in for the long haul


cause of death the heart killers 
you have the bestest of eyes i saw fuaiz white in dont touch my gang and he was too cute im happy he got a proper bl role and is already blissed out with tee 
also im so down with phi and jin having already a backstory which will speed out the kisses and everything else 


hey huntress where did you get this information i am seeing conflicting reports


cause of death the heart killers 
so the characters are in uni in episode 1 fuaiz the actor who plays white who has an nc scene was 17 while filming but his scene is really well crafted so yeah you arr gonna see a 17year old actor kissing as a uni student


ive watched a lot of horror flicks and have to say this is the most generous killer ive ever seen lending a helping hand to the young lovers and leaving an injured and totally helpless victim for someone to come and rescue by the time he showed up on the road with the scooter boys i thought he was going to pop out with a spare tire like yall need a little help there


i guess with 15 episodes they need to draw it out a bit

sorry im late commenting but this has me cackling 

them being like reginas mom from mean girls 


i really liked jjfuaiz  they are lovely together were they already a thing in thc 
also good surprise from copper and also very pleased with ta 
how their relationships are normal is very healthy i loved it no question about homosexuality just normal relationship drama

all i can say is if the black shadowy hand is gonna be involved in sexy times i hope it doesnt end up like in shadow be a good angry spirit boyfriend for once


it has nails 

welp its not going into any hole anytime soon


the question is is that a supernatural entity or barcodes character non 
i mean can you imagine if our boy goes from  baby porchay must protect  to  evil vengeful threesome ghost  


okayi wanna watch but im a huge chicken how scary is this


in my villain era
i put timestamps in my post above its pretty on brand with any slasher movie


thank you maybe i watch thru my hands


i am a scaredy cat and never watch any horror things and i say it is kinda scary there are random jumpscares not too scary but a bit which makes your heartbeat go fast for a few secs


that was so much fun at least 50 camp i am not sure if they want me laughing at the places i laughed at but i dont really care are they really going to kill off one of their leads so soon looking forward to next week


 okay i was laughing at some scene too hehe i was worried it was ganna be too scary but they balanced it out 


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
oh no or yes another bl to add to my currentlywatched list


that jin guy reminds me of i cannot reach you lead kentaro maeda i didnt know he was paired with ta and us character almost dead in 1st ep this plot reminds me of grand guinoi japanese bl movie and barcode is ghost here i think it involves that cult its good 

lets gooo i love slashers and this is also a gay slasher wow


its very camp


daaamn i dont really like horrorthriller but watching for the kids and i already screamed my heart out at that one jumpscare moment with the motorcycle scene  idk how ill survive the next episodes but first episode was so crazy already 
i didnt expect that intro at all i actually didnt expect anything but the kids had really natural acting expressions i really laughed at the random funny lines istg im defo hooked at the story now and will be following 


be on cloud gives me bighit enthybe labelskpop company vibes im eager to see what theyre going to serve  i hope it has an interesting plot and horror that gives people goose bumps

love how we got right into the story in episode 1 with tons of things already happening wow both couples are  that tension between phee and jin and the looks they were giving each other were  i was definitely a little perplexed at the abrupt ending with the next episode preview playing right away also with the after credits with the deleted scene and behindthescenes clips i was wondering if i needed to watch to see any extra scenes lol
i am glad that they are not shying away at all from the horror aspect i cant wait to see how it will build every episode its interesting how the group is a mix of people who were present during the past incident and also people who have no idea who non is at all im looking forward to the flashbacks there are a lot of relationships to uncover i wonder if well get some more info on phee and tan since jin commented on those two having some kind of relationship


watch process of a scaredy cat
watch without sound subtitles only distractedly on the phone tilting the phone allows to see general shapes without being scared able to see steam and characters
watch without sound but with direct visuals just put sound for non scary scenes which we know about because first watch steamy steamy
watch completely and hide when you know what is coming so that only sound may be scary


as a fellow scaredy cat thank you for this advice going to do this going forward cus i literally watched half of this show with one eye open two hands over my eyes and face


 tell me if it works for you  the no sound really helped me remove part of the fright and there were obvious scenes where i was like nooope and tilted the screen away slightly



ghost black crispy hand crotch grab  half a butt in seconds watz the jumper cables for can a motorbike jump start a pick up trucknice try tho waiting for barcode

its giving american horror story the  grabbin ghoul hand still got me thinking over here

no bc they way i physically jumped when i saw that


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
that phantom dicktouching hand was me btw


i must have watched a different show than everyone else cause i thought it was kinda awful at least scriptwise first introduce your characters then start the slashing lol i mean i barely know anyones name and honestly i dont really have any connection with any of them to really care this was all over the place imho at least the kissing scenes were pretty good boc knows how to do em 


in my villain era
you arent wrong but you pretty much just summed up the horror genre characters are pretty one dimensional and we get right into the slashing
you could start digging into the psychology of horror and how ultimately the audience often roots for the slasher but i think in this instance theyre just pulling on the traditional slasher tropes episode one reel them in and the background will start unfolding over the next episodes


horror movies usually lay the groundwork at the beginning usually with a killing or at least letting the audience have a peek at the upcomingshenanigans couldnt find a better word lol and then gives the audience time to know the characters this had lots of characters to introduce and was too fastpaced to really work as the introduction to a 12episode series im sure were gonna get to know everyone better eventually and hopefully they wont be one dimensional but my main issue is where do we go from here exactly when everyone already knows theres something creepy going on will everyone spend the rest of the show on fightorflight mode this was too much too soon imo but idk guess we gotta wait and see


in my villain era
my guess would be we they maybe going to tarantino this were staring with the end and then go back to the beginning especially with a 15 episode run


shut up you did not bring up my most favorite tarantino 


i hope its that and not a ton of flashbacks and sorry about the confusion re the episode count i was going off of what is listed on mdl


in my villain era
pffft mdl is full of lies iq lists the episode run which is always helpful

i think they started off this way because theyre going to do flashbacks etc and things may be calmer there so they wanted things fast and furious so to speak in this episode to get people hooked




earthmix 

isnt this a bit scary for a bl i mean it legit feels like horror movie and bl is just side of it wasnt expecting this to be the case ngl wheres my feel good vibes  

thats one episode down and 101215 depending on your source to go not sure i can stand all the hysterics each week gets tedious very quickly at least friday the 13th and all the other horror movies are over in two hours or less this feels like we will get all the sequels to them at once
cleveraliens208


so in my opinion thai horror is a hit or miss they either do real good at it ghost lab shutter or real bad most of the other horror things im holding out for this one though
i was real nervous about tee and top when they were on the moped thats for sure im really sad about us character not because im particularly fond of por hes real stupid but because i love us however he kinda got what he deserved for making stupid decisions lololol
all in all im so looking forward to this tbh i cant wait for the next episode


one thing i cannot stop thinking about is that phi ta white fuaiz and tan mio are all confirmed to have only transferred to the school in 12th grade  have not been there the last time the gang came to the house with non barcode we got plenty of scenes with phi  jin  tee kissing white in highschool uniforms though so im guessing its after the 1st cabin in the forest shenanigan so there will be at least 03 periods of time to be unraveled since thats the only way the storys gonna last for 12 eps imo
grade 1011 ish with non  meuk isnt meuk  non the same person he was the one in the mask choking top  was single out for being weird right  1st visit to the house to film the movie tee wore the killers costume here too jin seems close  protective of non kinda im curious about their dynamic here aside from their shared love of film making plus the way jin looked at non too lol there was some interest there definitively also some notable tension between tee  non 
grade 12  bloody toilet  haunted highschool halls non disappeared phiwhitetan transferred to the school  befriended w the gang tee  white dating  phi  jin hooking up  tan is hinted to have been involved somewhat so he might have had a crush on phi idk jin being obsessed with filming everything including him  phi hooking up at the school  i need to know how the scene w blood splattering on jins face while he slowly smiles like a maniac plays out  also im guessing perths character will play a part here
present days where the gang is in their 2nd year of uni its kinda suspicious that if so much bloody gory haunted shit has happened for the last 4 years of their life howwww are they so calm going back to where it all begined lol  it doesnt seem like their memories are altered since they still remember non will they start killing eo fluke w the gun  white slamming  a possessed  por  tee acting suspicious

uham i the only who thinks tas acting is weak he always has this up to mischief look even during the scene where he confronted jin abt their relationship

i havent finished the episode yet so i dont want to read through the whole thread but i am soooo curious so i will ask first and read after finishing the episode because i have a goldfish brain
does someone know how the film scenes like the blowjob  i mean i dont want to sound stupid but i am curious how they cover the front side if the backside is naked etc 


i dont know the specifics of dff but some possibilities i can think of
 use of doublesided tape
 guardmodesty garment eg sock
 onesided underwearthong
if people are comfortable its also possible for scenes to be filmed without coveringthis week on i know what you did last songkran this show is hilarious there are so many classic stupid horror movie decisions i do believe that they missed an opportunity for a skin care product placement when white briefly developed those boils
i love the preview for the next episode and theres an autopsy we all will be doomed because they might figure out what killed the guy whose head is not attached to his body 
need sexy time next time
this one is really great out of context


in my villain era
i have serious questions about med school in thailand as glasses keeps insisting he will be a doctor


that uncles scene has made me fear strings now 


in my villain era
this is campy fun for days every horror trope you can imagine and i love it
poor por just laying on that couch bleeding out for someone whose been in medical school his first aid is pretty shit
i do love asian horror theyre all on board with the ghost business
and of course we know somthing bad happened in the past but sadly no spice this week just the usual screaming and running
episode 2  timestamps 
  sexy time   scarygore time
615  jump scare 
2700  2758  gory little jump scare 
3706  beheading 


no sexy time 


in my villain era
no  not this week sadly


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
in fairness theres not a whole lot he can do in this situation they knew enough not to pull the branch out but beyond that the kid needs a trauma surgeon and antibiotics to keep from getting septic

that uncle deng kill is comical they really went from a humble impaling to that in a single episode 


sad that this doesnt have many comments enjoying it tho the acting and effects are marginally questionable
the scare at the end was pretty gross but enjoying the tropes and the characters the ahole characters escaping without their friends is irritating but plays into the genre well bit sad cuz tee is so hot and was enjoying the couple but oh well


in my villain era
i think the horror part is deterring some also no sexy time this week


bocs cinematography
still loving that this is a horror show first also love that were seeing the divide between the friends group in the ones that helped film the first video and the ones that came after  you need a good divide in a large ensemble in a horror flick and we have the two shithead characters that you always get in horror that are freaking out and are just out for themselves in the panic at the motorcycle duo in tee and top tee is also hella hot
i also like that they arent afraid to show that killer mask in the daytime daytime often makes things look less scary and daylight is obviously less forgiving than dark light but even in bright light it still looks creepy i love the exposed teeth and lidless eyes


not panic at the motorcycle 


i am horrible  i started laughing when you know what happened with uncle dang he was gonna get that food to them no matter what


it is still a horror first and a bl second which is good  i am looking forward to the development and the various reveals concerning their relationships
also scary 


am here for jin coz he looks more and more like yamato i cant reach you ok first rule of survival never go off alone thats a sure fire way of getting killed beware of that hysterical screamer characteram talking bout you tophave we not learned from all those scream franchisemission destroy hard drive of nons short film coz its cursed the ringanyone who sees it will die the motorcycle duo went back the same way where uncle dang got decapitated wheres the wire when trying to escape stay on the hiway suddenly motorcycle duo was in the woodseverybody was hallucinating sights and sounds there must be something in the water lack of sleep stressedam still waiting for barcode


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
its always interesting to see what rules we have in one country that other countries dont follow in the us shows rarely have characters with names that start with the same letter because its more confusing for the audience to remember who is who meanwhile this show has nine characters 3 of whom have t names and basically all of whom have 3 letter names so far there are like 2 characters that i know their actual names versus the nicknames ive given them in my head



ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
have you ever watched tharntype that one is even worst like 75 of the characters on that show have t names its such a struggle 



i hope they take the route of one of the boys being the killer and not the ghost being the responsible
up to now jin is my favourite he is probably the murderer or at least he is at the center of it
phee is probably the main character and the most rational but i dont understand his relationship with jin he seems to like him nice scene in the woods  but at the same time he is very cocky with him
top and tee i think they wont last too much today they betrayed the group even if tee regretted it with he thought about white so maybe theyll die stupidly trying to run away or in a fight with the other boys

i know it wasnt funny but i almost laughed my lungs out when the uncle got decapitated his smile and then boom dd here is your food dalmost the entire episode i was more terrified of fluke rather than the actual masked murderer
why on earth was he acting so scary who yells and shakes a guy who is already bleeding to death
plus the way he looked and talked to white when he saw him playing the disk
luckily from the look of next week he returns to normal
that masked murderer movements come off as laboured and stiff i think if they all werent so terrified they could overpower him


hope hes next to go


bocs cinematography
 my guess is that its actually top under the mask there might be some sort of possessionspirit transference thing going on like a summoning with the altar and the blood like with how por has been bleeding from the eyes then sleeping and now seizing thats just me throwing a prediction out there
 the locations in this show are gorgeous the cabin is both lush and lovely but also has that perfect isolated horror cabin feel and the woods around it are also stunningly and yet feel claustrophobic and the temple is beautiful but eerie the location scouts nailed it
 white is my fave character hes peak final girl i also love that he and tee feel like a real couple there is a lot of casual touching when they are around which we dont often get in bls unfortunately i believe that tees love for white is genuine like in the last episode got scared and swept up in tops hysteria but when he thought of white he realized what he was doing and how his first thought wasnt to save his own skin but to run to white even though it was running towards the killer
 top is panicky idiot 1 sorry were looking for a duhduh idiot  iykyk but fluke is suspicious idiot 1 not only does he not know anything about police procedure i dont like to give cops a ton of credit but they do know how to deduce when fingerprints are on a body incidentally and rule people out but being a creepy weirdo isnt helping your case bro i kinda like top even though hes hysterical honestly cant blame him  everyone likes to think they would be calm and collected in a horrific situation but thats actually not the norm but fluke can totally be the next person to die theres always at least one hella annoying character in an ensemble slasher that youre glad when they have a gruesome death axe murderer do you thing
 is it gay if you hide from a slasher in a coffin with your bro whose dick you just bit the day before asking for a friend


fully agree fluke is being so creepy i hope white is final girl but i am so scared hes gonna be an early out i feel like jin and phee are definitely solid as final couple final 2


in my villain era
filler episode this week gang no time stamps required  no spice no sexy
white is my favorite i like a character in a horror with common sense he was giving me bimbo vibes before but hes pretty collected
all the tropes again this week could have bet money tee would fall 
i was hoping wed get more backstory this week but looks like were just tension building and red herrings itll come
we end in a cliff hanger this week as well nicely played

i like white too hes giving final girl vibes or in this case final boy


in my villain era
im of the belief that final girl is final girl regardless of gender comment image

i feel the same way about white he pays attention hes smart and hes brave  he knew it was risky to go and try and watch the video but he did it anyway


bocs cinematography
i havent watched yet but i also love white he is peak final girl

im really enjoying this its a bit campy at times and this was more on display this week imo but i get the feeling that this was done pretty low budget haha
my favourites so far are phee jin and white but i really need to know more about phee and jins background because right now im very  about what happened between the two of them


bocs cinematography
i like the campiness because it makes it feel even more like a classic 70s80s teen slasher


wannabe doc is highly suspect he wants to shut up por might as well kill himconfrontation at the temple dude there are 4 of you only 1 of him he is not superhuman you already bashed the masked murderer he was down should have bashed him more removed his maskoh well still no barcodemaybe well get lucky next episode


we did see barcode dancing in the video for a few seconds 


cause of death the heart killers 
white should be protected at all costs i dont know how i feel about tee hes been falling out and in of my good side at least hes going back and he was all my faen and im also rooting for jinpheen i hope now that they are locked in that coffin theyll talk things out and kiss 
this story is giving me ten little indians vibes

this is sooo good oh my god i couldnt breathe
lmao i loved when tee was running after the murderer and fell down meanwhile the murderer just casually rode the motorbike dd


its so camp i was losing it

i love these kind of horrors

well now the killer is just not scary anymore  him taking the motorbike especially its a mundane sight that i never expect to see in a horror
but hes different from the spirit no so hopefully theres still some horror left


in my villain era
i loved the camp of it made me giggle just casually getting on the motorbike
now it could be one of the boys in disguise like a misdirect but im guess its probably non

im curious what makes you say this the slasher genre is oldschool horror actually some of it reminds me a bit of the scream series


which part
the one about the killer being not scary is just how i feel at this point i dont really watch horror so i have no point of reference that said in my imagination you wouldnt see how a killer get from one place to another they just appear and disappear so watching him get on that motorbike feel scooby dooy
the one about the spirit its because it seems that the shadowy hand that was involved in ep 1 sexy times is unrelated to this killer

it depends on the type of horror sometimes there is the element of the unknown but sometimes you see them doing mundane things the fear factor comes from the fact that their identity is unknown and that theyre trying to kill the main character for example here i think theyre also adding a heavy dose of mystery so the suspense comes from that more than from watching what theyre doing but theres also a teenslashercamp element thats a factor here
as for whether or not theres a spirit well have to see itd be unusual if they mixed genres but they may very well be boc is known to do things like that


oh god fluke trying to kill por shaking him up and moving the branch in the chest to shut him up its something i didnt expect clearly they did something horrible to non and theyre shitting bricks for it
white has been my favourite this week i like that under that apparent fragility he has the brains
at least its clear that the murderer its human that slopiness fighting and then running away with the motorbike tell clearly he is not a spirit 
i know its unlikely considering the situation but i would love if jin and phee have sexy time in the coffin 


man im loving this show so much and also cannot get over former macaus eyes like when did the baby get hot my brain and body are so confused


is this series worth checking out im currently watching the sign and pitbabe i also just watched kinnporsche for the first time so now im trying to find other series to get hooked on


if you like slasher horror with a lot of camp this isnt it


i feel the k is none other than nons dad or brotherhorror tropes were tropeing but i liked it fluke is so paranoid and had a full psychotic break hes dead meat soon 
it seems like non may have been killed as a sacrifice by his friends to grant their wishes they said something about that in the beginning 


cause of death the heart killers 
fluke is so paranoid and had a full psychotic break hes dead meat soon 
for half a second i was feeling for him when he was explaining about the video and the impact on his career but then he went back to being stupid and threatening baby white and i just cant have it


bocs cinematography
man the episodes feel so short i am engrossed
 who is mr keng was that body bag of dry leaves an effigy of him
 fluke you fucking moron there is always that one horror trope character that isnt the killer but it so selfish and paranoid that they just ruin everything for everyone else
 white and phee best boys poor white was so scared i love that phee is the calm one but still caring about jin i want to know their backstory and even though there is something off with tee i actually really like him as a character i cant wait to see his backstory more and him immediately throwing himself in front of white to shield him  i said it last week and ill say it again that tee and white have such a good casual intimacy about them


cause of death the heart killers 
and him immediately throwing himself in front of white to shield him  i said it last week and ill say it again that tee and white have such a good casual intimacy about them
ill give him that but foes he really deserve white though


oh almost definitely not but despite being a controlling dck he does genuinely seem to care for white


bocs cinematography
we dont know  im sure hes done some shit but maybe whites not as innocent as he seems


cause of death the heart killers 
white is best boy and im dying on that hill like he can kill someone and ill think they deserved it


tee literally tried to leave once already white deserves better


cause of death the heart killers 
im gonna say that he was freaking out at the time and when he got his senses back he went back for him bit im starting to feel like no one would be enough for our precious baby white

i agree so much literally in this episode baby white and phee are my top fav like at first i thought phee was a horn dog but apparently his also someone good to have in a horror situation also wtf baby white was almost left alone his bf almost left him like damn i felt so bad for white his so innocent isnt if he dies before the finale i swear their will be hell to pay

im so fascinated with this show and really like how its keeping me guessing as to whether theres supernatural involvement or not like even now im still a bit sus as to just whats going on
cant wait for the flashback scenes to come i want to know what went down i want to see jin and phees past in particular because i have no idea what happened between them i want to know what tee did and whether he deserves my baby white


cause of death the heart killers 
i want to know what tee did and whether he deserves my baby white
this 100


bocs cinematography
i havent had a chance to watch yet i cant wait though  im fucking loving this show but one thing that is sticking in the back of my mind is from the first episode where tee said to white you promised to be obedient if you came or something along those lines either tee is mad controlling or possessive or theres something more to white that we havent seen yet because its not like white is a terror who is flirting with everyone and is hard to control  so unless tee is a complete bastard which he may be it just struck me as something odd to say

tee seems like an asshole so id bet on him being controlling and possessive 


in my villain era
im low key thinking tee has a thing and he and naut had a thing


bocs cinematography
hmmm interesting tee is definitely not a squeaky clean character i still like him though  im intrigued as to what his past is so that would be interesting


cause of death the heart killers 
wait whos naut


in my villain era
sorry non not naut barcodes character we havent met yet


cause of death the heart killers 
no worries im always so bad with names that i get anxious when im missing someone


in my villain era
was trying to think where the name naut came from then i realized it was one of the playboyy charicters 


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant keep those straight too many characters in so many shows i cant


in my villain era
no sexy time this week whole lot of horror tropes and screaming
white continues to be my favorite character and honestly the actor is the strongest so far this whole episode was mainly fluke having a meltdown and yelling the standard sanity slippage trope i would have honestly thought it would have been tee and not fluke and i was surprised with the mask reveal not who i was thinking well done poor por guys been dying for 4 episodes
white calling out fluke mid rant was actually fantastic shouldnt you use a clean needle and thread
looks like next week were finally going to find out what happened to not
timestamps
600  jump scare 
1400  gory sews up por 
2740  gory top pulls out the stick holding por together 


there are so many layers to that story
non
keng
and all these past relationships we know nothing about 
also yeah i just love fuaiz i also think jjay plays really well his character is despicable but the good kind of despicable very egoistical and dark
and we still dont know what is real what is hallucination what is possession what is just craziness
very interesting

man i cant get enough of this show i cant wait until next week honestly these eps need to come out faster  it looks like were finally gonna get a bit of a backstory and context im excited to see their relationship with non esp jin cuz the ep preview looked sus as hell with that whole thigh caress 
and they better give me more pheejin in the next ep 


im a little disappointed about the guilty party being a spirit or some kind of possesion i hope they explain that top was poisoned or drugged
fluke is probably innocent but so stupid and paranoid that he fd everything telling the rescue team not to come to them
por is gone and top probably too fluke is at the deep end and probably will be ended up soon by tee or even by white i still insist that he is no so innocent and weak as he seems
we got just two scenes of jin and phee but were very cute i wonder why they fell out
finally in the preview we watch what happened one year ago jin and non seemed more than friends or at least jin was interested in him i still say that jin has something to do with everything


cause of death the heart killers 
im so invested in whites survival im about to throw chanclas at my screen whenever topfluke appear and the jury is still out about tee tbh
is there something wrong with me because i was bummed there were no spicy shenanigans happening inside that coffin phi was cute to jin though hes getting those brownie points not to get bitten next time
so excited for next week because well see what the whole thing was about but i will be missing white and phi non looks cute though


fluke really went down the spiral this episode and his paranoia and obsession with keeping his profile clean to protect his future prospects was so believable and relatable to me because i was damn paranoid and sensitive during my final year in uni too and it was stressful af to protect my grades and making sure everything was fine
top really upped the scary and creepy factor to me  im so damn happy im not alone tonight
also them crying during that scene was just great acting because it looked natural to me who went into the drama not expecting to be amazed as most really didnt have any stellar works to look at
someone protect white the little baby 
barcode finally showing next week screaming  someone take off those sus hands away from him im watching your every move jin 
why cant we get two episodes at least per week i need answers and one ep isnt enough 



when the masked villian removed his maskwas that top or nonbarcode i couldnt tell oppsie it is top i looked at the shoes so top is part of a revenge plot conspiracy with whom non at this point everyone is guilty and complicit in what they did to non
fluke wanna be doctor was so unhinged super paranoid he is definitelygoing cray cray por rip
flashbacks with barcode at last looking forward for more horrific developments


the masked villian was top if you look back at the ground youll see his white and black adidas and his white pants with the black line down the sides
also im super excited to see the flashbacks with barcode to i really wonder what happened
i think por had the idea to use jin against non so he could win the film contest he wanted non to write the script so maybe the only way it would happen is if jin convinced him to thats my theory but also i think maybe jin started to get feelings for non idk
another thing i think the whole reason tee and top think non is dead is because of what we saw when top was having a seizure someone was going after top i think non and then non on the ground my other theory is that non got to into the film and character and they got scared and hit him after they hit him its possible he stopped breathing for bit so they thought he died 
maybe they left him there thats why fluke said to white who would want to watch the video of a friend disappearing
but right now i still dont know what to think


fujoshi
with top puking up sludge like that i assume he iswas possessed im not sure if hes been the masked murderer this whole time or just since last episode watching week to week quite frankly i dont remember when he got separated from the rest of the group 


i think there are two of them like in scream last episode when tee and top were fleeing using the motorbike after that decapitation the masked killer threw an ax at them thats why they fell and got separated


hope everything makes sense and dumb doctor only few will survive now i guess next week preview seems promising and finally flashback ep with barcode  for next weektheres so much more depth here than some people are picking up on imo none of the characters are really being presented as purely innocent or bad i think and i believe that the ones who seem one or the other are going to develop more depth as we go along
por  is a spoiled rich baby but also seems desperate for the approval of his parents or at least of his father his father also seems to be abusive from the clip we saw of next week
tee  i have to go back to pay closer attention to the dialogue but it seems like his father is possibly sick hes beholden to his uncle who is using him for his own benefit by getting him involved in the money laundering we know that his uncle ends up in legal trouble later on what happened
fluke  doesnt seem to be directly involved but keeps getting dragged into his friends messes this happens in the earlier eps too  he hasnt done anything but he keeps getting affected and we can see the mental toll its taken
top  hes actually one of the characters we know the least about and im curious to learn more hes obviously very self serving though and willing to let non take the fall for him
im curious about some dynamics here
tee and non  well actually non and all of them except jin why do they dislike him so much it seemed to go beyond just bullying i wonder if non did something in the past had a breakdown or something and thats why they have this dislike of him
keng and non  non did not look comfortable when the teacher offered him the ride is he the heart emoji in nons phone what happened to keng since he seems to have ended up dead
new  who is he the obvious link that seems to be staring us in the face is pheephi and nonnong but is that the case
tan and white  how do they play into this particularly tan white is tees partner but is he as innocent as he seems or is there more than meets the eye why has tan been asking so many questions
tee and white  how did the two of them connect and fall in love the two of them actually fascinate me
perth the actor  whenhow will he get involved
and lastly phee and jin whats phees history how did he and jin end up together whats jins story beneath him protecting non etc how did he become friends with the others or is it just a matter of not realizing what they were like the difference in his character is obvious in the flashback hes become much harder unhappier imo
so many questions im loving it i cant wait until next week


you are so on point with your analysis 
this mixed with what we had in the trailer really make me wonder specifically for teewhite it seems like white pursued tee more than the contrary also they are part of the  university  crew for which again only in trailers and sneak peek with phee jin white tee and por the tangle is deep

i think white is really the clueless guy hes the final boy  poor him tho i wouldnt want to date a guy like tee 


honestly after analysis of other trailers white cant be that much of a clueless boy for me thats more tan
white is seen fighting with jin in a trailer i think it is him he is part of the university team to which stuff seems to happen whether they are just acting for jin or something truly happens is yet to be seen but there is like a whole preview on that specific period i also think i saw him being traumatised in one scene and there is this whole entanglement with tee which is more than just a passing romance they have a lot of scenes together
there is also this strange scene where jin is filming himself in a mirror and the picture glitches and white suddenly appears next to him 
i dont know what to do of this but that does not scream innocent final boy that will simply make it through


im inclined to agree the general reaction to white makes him come across as an audience surrogate channeling last survivor in a horror movie vibes however one of the fundamentals of the horror genre is that everything is not as it seems at first glance friendly faces might be enemies and monsters could have been the victims of tragic circumstances so i wouldnt be surprised if he turns out to be not as innocent as initially portrayed


imo none of them are innocent maybe with the exception of non at the start they all hide something and have all or will all do something nefarious it seems like the serie is good like that
they will all have reasons and circumstances ok maybe some will just be nefarious but i dont believe any of them to be pure good i am really looking forward to knowing more 

hmmm i think dating someone like tee is kinda weird if youre good  who knows i hope hes evil too

isnt it obvious that tee is hiding things from him white doesnt fully know his partner its probably going to be devastating for him when he finds out the truth 

which trailer are you watching there seems to be one that may be unrelated or just thematic to the show thats the shorter one that boc released first it doesnt seem to fit at all with what weve seen so far in the show


there were three videos i recently analysed in a post on thaibl first the prerelease video the sneakpeek and the official trailer


oof this episode was hard to watch poor non  this friend group consists of only assholes and their followers apart from jin why is he even friends with these guys they are the worst

maybe jin has a secret too


he certainly does one does not get splattered with blood smiling like he did in the trailer


cause of death the heart killers 
ok the jury is out tee sucks and he doesnt deserve white like i get that everyone has their issues that make them do what they do but in the present tee doesnt seem to be repentant just regretful i really really hate top liars and people that cant accept their wrongdoings just make my blood boil on the other hand i can see where por is coming from maybe because i know he just died in the present now how did fluke get involved in all this mess
one thing for sure i cant blame the guys for not knowing the answer to the calculus problem that teacher he would make me stupid for sure
barcode is killing it as non though hes giving innocent but in the brink of losing his mind really well if this ends up being paranormal i cant blame him for going off from the afterlife  teamnon tbh

jokes on you im into that
that teacher would make me be like did you just say words with your face


cause of death the heart killers 
what are words

jokes on you im into that
were in calculus i thought this was chemistry


cause of death the heart killers 
all the same the moment that man walked through that door tbh

looks like trigonometry 

the teacher was like let me explain and then he just wrote something and he didnt even explained it  what a great tutor


cause of death the heart killers 
no one was paying attention thats for sure

typical math class 

yeah tee needs to gtf away from white
but that teacher gave me sus vibes 


cause of death the heart killers 
hes a sleaze but a hot af one


maybe he has all this pressure on him to get good grades and get into a good school maybe scholarships sometimes parents especially east asian parents will put all this pressure on you and even more so when are from a poor family lucky if they dont have a restaurant or business because then you will be pulling double duty with working for them and heavy school load because a good education to good job can take you out of poverty at least thats the goal and the ideal
also idk if new is favoured over non because momma was all about sending new money is new at university cant work a job like she was going to get an emergency loan like i hope it wasnt a loan from a loan shark because girl thats gonna kill ya


cause of death the heart killers 
definitely the pressure is doing nothing for his sanity i feel new might be the son who says hes studying while hes wasting his life away doing nothimg bit get the money from his parents 


you are right plus do we know what country he is in is he in usa london singapore australia because if he was say in usaaustralialondon then even his parttime wages assuming he has scholarship to schoolwork study or under the table is more than what he would make in thailand unless hes just partying it up and getting money from parentsguess we will seethey better tell us and show us lol


cause of death the heart killers 
so many questions too few answers


i wonder if bible was the math consultant for this 


cause of death the heart killers 
you got a point there


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i cant wait for top to get murdered
also tee is an idiot why is he getting the smartest kid in class to be involved with this bank account scam when he has a moron like top right there

he has leverage over non and doesnt over top though

i agree and he doesnt know hes struggling with money and non is unfortunately the easy target 


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
except that top broke the camera and panicked about being able to pay por back it seems like a lot fewer steps for tee to be like dont worry i can help you out vs going through the motions of setting up my sweet lil sweet face non
i know its because he is friends with top and doesnt care aboutactively bullies non but still seems like a lot of extra hassle

hes just a bully 

the bullying was brutal damn i cried i was bullied too and it really leaves you with an indescribable empty feeling what does jin want tho just to date him
also i translated the messages between non and the mysterious person
who could that be wow the backstories were so interesting i love this show


is that a white circle next to the i miss you  
is that white  

no its this emoji 


complete ghost ship right now but i would melt for barcodefuaiz

yess me too but im scared of jin


i am honestly not difficult i would ship anything with barcode or anything with fuaiz if the have to be a polycule i take it 


it looks like an smiley type emoji


oh god i loved and hated this episode with passion
what these motherers did to ton is beyond hideous im so glad theyre all going to die horribly
por is dead and i think top too because fluke was beyond crazy when he shot so two less motherfers tee is going to fall soon because everyone blames him for what he did to ton
its clear who is the guilty party here nons lover and new nons intelligent brother
if you ask me those two are phee and white dont know who is who
i dont think white is so innocent as he seems he is very intelligent so i believe him able to infiltrate the group becoming tees lover and the same with phee with jin
i dont know if jin is guilty too he is the only one who was nons friend so i dont know if he is just a victim whom they hid what happened to non or was the one who stabbed non at the worst moment
the next episode was going to be painful and probably where these aholes take non to the vacation house and kill him so grab the tissues and brace yourselves


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
oooh i like the theory that white is the ex and phee is the brother and they teamed up to get revenge it would make sense that theyd target tee who is clearly getting non caught up in something illegal and jin who was closest to non maybe the hotsuss teacher was doing something unsavory to non and became their first victim
ngl my macauchay ghostshipping heart was hoping barcode and ta would make out at some point but im willing to sacrifice that for a vengeful brother murder spree


bocs cinematography
the fact that someone in the pheetanwhite group that wasnt there for what went down with non also immediately jumped to my mind one of them is definitely the heart or the brother


you managed to put into words my feelings
in the clips white going for tee seems purposeful like he really went for it and it would make sense if it was for long game revenge
also fun note but fuaiz had to say an aggressive line in some of the extra games and he was like i never played a bad guy and everyone howled and laughed i dont know what to make of it 
also would go with the white being sad clip the white fighting jin and white appearing from nowhere
and phee being the big bro would make sense but may also be a red herring salmon know how to play with us 


finally found out some of the backstory and this group of friends are bullies as expected  i dont know why jin and fluke are friends with them maybe peer pressure or to save themselves from being bullied too but they share some of the blame for whatever happened to non  
 the tutor seems sketchy too and i think may have done something to non as well



i love the plot kudos to the writers wow this ep was so good and barcode woah from porchay to non with his entrance he nailed his role and this ep was interesting and unique screw those frnds especially tee and that top guy so selfish and whats with those drugs tho that non intakes something is fishydirection is lit and acting is fineto certain extent love the plotand also the actors and jj looks so different i couldnt recognize him here with his dyed hairteacher role 
i guess its revenge either by that tutor jj or maybe his brother newto whom their parents send money to in abroad idk but i love the story and what they do to non is just so worseand im excited how his ghostmaybe drugged murderers will take his revenge 
i guess jins crush is one sided and he later did some nasty shit to non in the end and that guy is a mystery is he the tutor idk


wasnt non texting with guy before we met the tutor im kinda hoping against hope that we get a jeff satur cameo 


delulu is trululu thatll be a surprise element tho itll be lit

omg that was jj i couldnt even recognize him 


yep thats 2j from kinnporsche to differentiate him from jj or jjay which is paired with fuaiz amazing

i always know him like time from kinnporsche


the only one i feel bad for dying is that old man bringing them food that had his head sliced off by the wire he seemed innocent unless he isnt lol


bocs cinematography
so someone from the pheetanwhite triumvirate is totally a plant they are either the brother or the heart emoji on nons phone or there are two plants and they are working together for revenge
the fact that mr keng is dead he was there for a reason
jin seems so nice here but there is definitely more going on with him he goes from being kind to the school outcast to what we see in the present tees a bastard but im fascinated with him hes not wholly bad as we see with him needing money to help his father and in the present he is willing to run back into danger for white and top being top it seems since the very beginning just wanted to run and save his own ass
por is totally one of those dudes that tries to start either game streaming or podcasting and gets all the expensive cameras and microphones and equipment first before he even knows if hes going to be successful like your iphone would have done the job just fine especially with a found footage movie bitch you want the grain
barcode is killing it with this role though i would have maybe given him a makeunder because they call him greasy and hes got gorgeous shiny hair and is one of the prettiest boys in school
this show is so fucking good so fucking good even though nothing scary happened you could feel the rising tension that we were on a collission course with disaster


someone maybe on tumblr analysed that greasy may be linked to poverty instead of simple appearance 
its like dirt poor and the notion that poor people are dirty which also explains why they wipe their hands after touching him
but agreed barcode is truly beautiful and a pure delight to watch acting


in my villain era
we could do a horror trope bingo with this series they are throwing everything at the wall finally barcode makes his entrance and we are getting the backstory looks like well take a couple episodes to get the full story but there is a lot of episodes to go
flowers to jet he plays the asshole character really well hes absolutely insufferable in this episode
i an sus about the tutor get the feeling well be seeing more of him soon and who is nons parents sending money too what happened to non that hes on meds so many questions as the plot thickens
no timestamps this week as no sexy time and no scares but tw for bullying


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i think its nons brother the mother said something about non studying abroad like his brother does when they were eating dinner



barcode is inda haus barcodenon is brainy he takes medsbipolar pors group is envious they dont have his brain and talent its obvious theyre just using him with jin as the leadman use him and drop himwatabunchofaholesnon still hopes with what he did for them theyd include him in their cliquei can see that set up a mile awaynon is now a mule for money laundering tnx to u evil tee


quick question  has the show established the ages of these characters are they all the same age or just the same class at uni but white is def the youngest right 
 the show heavily hints that new is like an older brother to non but i dont think they explicitly state that new is actually an older brother   my first thought was that new are one in the same but the  emoji is a red herring to make you think that this is a separate person who has a romance with non  except the actual texts are misleading too because theyre not romantic in nature  just i miss yous are you at school are you free to talk very generalized   
but we all know theres no way the new trio whitetanphee came into the friend group by chance at least one or all three maybe is pulling the strings and manipulating things bts in a big way  i would love if theyre all in this for revenge because they all had some specific relationship to non either by blood friendship or romantic entanglement 

oh the theory about  being new is nice i like we see that  is very caring asks if he took the meds asks if he arrived safely i think  but not available when non called them multiple times and the i miss you could also be something between siblings since we know that new is abroad
maybe i misunderstood but who of them 3 is related to non by blood 
but my friend and i had similar theories about at least phee and tan serving reasons to believe in this theory


the show hasnt established that anybody is related to non by blood yet  im just theorizing at this point  but i wouldnt be surprised if it is phee which i would love  possible scenes between the younger brothers of kp count me in  
also correct me if im wrong but dont pheenong translate into older brotheryounger brother in thai  but this could be a mislead though   

yeah i wrote that i could have misunderstood you  english isnt my first language so its hard for me to always understand everything in the way it was meant and thats why i ask  sorry if this bothered you i didnt watch kp so i dont even know who the younger brothers are  i only know ta is playing the younger brother of vegas i think but i dont know whos brother barcode is 
i dont think they would choose these names without any meaning 


just saw this  no worries at all i figured it was a misunderstanding 
the more i think about phee being new the less likely i think itll happen though its way too obvious with the big brotherlittle brother translation and the timeline probably doesnt add up
but i do want some kind of connection between non and phee to be revealed though i just want a scene with them 
you should watch kp its ridiculous and fun at the same time but ta played macau whos the younger brother to vegas and barcode played porschay who is porsches younger brother

porschay and porsche thai and their names 
i have so much on my cw list i need to finish something else first  but kp is definitely on my plan to watch soon list


barcode casting is really spot on he is born for this kind of character i just cant wait to witness his duality i usually despise bullying plots it just pissed me to the hell they do really make a good bullies i hate them

soo everyone except jin is a bully and a piece of shit that makes it so much easier for me to watch them get killed off


in my villain era
i hope before tee gets killed white finds out what an absolute ass he is points if its white that kills him 

same i need tas character jin barcodes character and white to ride off into the sunset while everyone else gets stuck at the murder cabin forever


bocs cinematography
tan too he hasnt done anything wrong yet


see hes the one i feel like were all sleeping on do we know anything about him other than hes phees friend i was thinking maybe he could be new andor   he just comes off as collateral damage and the character that has to ask all the questions so the viewers  can find out more info  hes the most sus to me at least right now of the trio whitepheetan  


i have a maybe crazy theory
what if jin is behind the mask ghost attacks he seems to be genuine with non at least from what we have seen its clearly a group effort more than 1 ghost and prioritizing the  who bullied non and are involved in nons disappearance that will also make sense since he wants to leave everything behind after this trip and go abroad also maybe the ones with him are the new non brother and the one non was texting heat emoji
i cant wait to see what will happen


i dont think its jin because he gets attacked too and he hears these crazy voices that phee didnt hear episode 1 balcony scene only top heard them too as far as i remember so the attack wouldnt be a reason to negotiate the theory but the voices wouldnt make sense to only act as if he would hear something if phee doesnt hear them too and he sees mr keng and hears voices again but phee sees and hears nothing


i see your point and i agree and i assume jin is not totally innocent in the end maybe something that involves the tutor
i really like the theory that many people are involved for revenge and have a mole inside the group there is so much going on and i really want answers and a lot of twists


in my villain era
not crazy that would actually fit in horror trope wise for the unhinged character out for vengeance


i would just like to hold poor non in my arms

wow i definitely feel a bit scared to watch the next episode and i do not even remember flinching while watching the glory


bocs cinematography
im at stupid work and customers are being stupid and i just want to watch this shoooooowwwww but i cant just leave because im management and have to close


lol ditto i just want to flip the on eternal lunch break back when im good and ready sign


i had so many thoughts about this episode its insane my friend threw the guess in that she would love a twist that  is actually one of the boys in the house who helps non to get revenge i think it could be she named tan for example and oh boy now i see 23930 things that would totally fit in this theory what also fits to it phee was the one who assumed to watch a movie searched through the stuff suggested to make a remake insisted inetc also white randomly encouraging tee in this wanting to see them making the remake although they didnt see a lot of the movie yet so why are you so down bad for this lmao they saw nothing much interesting to be so excited for a remake but thats probably nothing  only us getting lost in theories
i assumed  was perth in the beginning since we dont know him yet the teacher is also sketchy but he didnt know him when he got the message so but obviously something happened to the teacher  wonder if non was involved in this what happened to the teacher i mean oh i hope thats nothing connected to abusesa or something like this like someone mentioned non looked so uncomfortable with the teacher alone in the classroom he looked pretty okay almost proud  i mean the teacher looked okay and nice but heyits always the nice guys  but back to the  it would totally make sense if it would someone we already know because there is no name but they give us immediately a message from jin to show its not jin what many people probably assumed because jin is so nice to non
so far tan and phee are the only ones who never saw the killer alone only when they were with others or i oversaw something my memory is bad so i wouldnt be surprised fluke didnt see him too but i guess thats because hes always with por and he got strangled lol
the moment we saw non taking meds i screamed what if they get drugged and seehear things because of this  and of course the question for what does he take them its a lot of stuff hes taking
i think we definitely see that phee white and tan are less involved in things happening to them than the boys who knew non so far white tan and phee also didnt hear the mysterious voices that jin and top heard in the first episode
i also wonder how phee and tan join the group in the beginning and how tee and white met
fluke looks so fucked up all the time  hes so passive and quiet only wants to become a doctor but everyone around him fucks up and drags him into it this guy seems mentally absolutely not okay  i hate him a bit because hes so harsh to my crybaby white but i also understand himkinda hes confusing af as he should be i know he looks very observant but not obvious there to see for others like in the scene with the broken camera  and it doesnt make any sense for him to stay there longer and destroy the walkietalkie if it would be for his career because things are only getting worse if they stay longer and dont get out of this freaking cabin i am so curious about his character why hes always so annoyed and fucked up why he is friends with them well that also counts for white tan jin and phee this group seems so off why do they even spend time together phee and tee also have this tension all the time that they are fed up with eo what is his role here expect of a sophomore med student and a detective conan viewer 
i am definitely looking forward to next weeks episode although i find the flashback a little bit too draggy sometimes i just love how interesting the story is it leaves so much room for theories although it starts with a clich plot a group of friends a cabin in the wood a bully victim disappeared and yet its not predictable what really happened so good considering that its the second  show from this company rookie actors and we all know that bls doesnt have a huge budget this show is really great so far
edit another thing that leaves me confused the bathroom scene with white in the beginning of the show where his skin had those bubbles on it he doesnt really look concerned about this and he doesnt really care about them just disappearing 



profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
at first i was like awwww poor por just dying out here now im like idgaf theyre all such bullies omg  minus sweet jin of course big fan of jin but omg my heart hurts for non 

jokes on you im into that
everyone is analyzing the clues weve gotten and my ass is over here omfg thats names room why would they reuse names house for yet another character that gets overlookedtreated badly by friends boc youre some sick people i highly doubt it was plannedugh poor non going through so much abuse  barcodes acting is really great though i hope well continue to see more of him in the next few episodes before jumping back to the present
that said
tacode tacode tacodeeeeeee 
pheejin is probably going to be endgame since were assuming non is deadmissing forever but man my inner macauchay from kp has reawakened and is absolutely vibrating at the pheenon were getting next episode



ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
my ghost ship tabarcode is actually sailing truly i have never been so lucky
i was cackling when the boys were sitting at the table at school and jin was just casually watching kinnporsche
tee and top are garbage do we know what the favor was that tee asked of him or is that still to be revealed still v excited for top to die
now that we know phi is the secret boyfriend i wonder if the brother will be making an appearance perhaps tan ive been wondering how hes going to fit into all this especially since hes very much taking initiative in the present day to find out what happened to non
based on the preview it looks like the shady tutor is finally making his move my assumption is that non tells him that he needs money to pay back the customer and the shady tutor offers it in exchange for sleeping with him because hes gross also excited to learn who gets to kill him


omg if tan is the brother i will actually like scream i think thats honestly such a good answer to so many of my questions but idk because this series is always making me shocked
i agree so much that tee is garbage but at least we got his backstory of why hes an asshole i wonder what shit top has gone through to excuse his actions they probably wont be
if white is with tee for real and isnt a part of the revenge i sincerely hope he dumps tees ass so hard he should get with tan frfr cuz hes the only not trash and single guy


bocs cinematography
not sure but top definitely knew about the whole plot because of his 3 looking smirk when the others were asking if they got the letters about the bank accounts what letter what letter im totally innocent nothing


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
im changing my mind i think white is nons brother we dont know for sure he was older and it would make sense that he attached himself to tee since we know tee was the main person who fucked non over
i still dont know who tan is though

there are strong hints that tan is the brother considering he is asking the most questions 


i honestly think white is nons brother


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
yeah ive since changed my mind to white as the brother


i will officially be there for at least the next week the tear  both their expressions  the gentle hold of phee and the grasp of non  their hands 
i am absolutely feral


ngl it one of the most beautiful pictures ive ever seen so intimate



yo the pheejin arc gonna hit soo different now also the visceral rage i feel every time the boys disrespect non means that they are doing a good job lmao


i am just so freaking happy that some of my theories got proven right i love this feeling  i am so so so excited for the next episode it really looks like the teacher is giving non money in exchange for his life what would prove the theory that hes part of the cult and they indeed sacrifice people  i agree with the people who like couples that arent fixed and have them mixed up but stilli kinda feel sad and betrayed for jin  at first i thought tan would be  and i think that wouldve been also pretty exciting but it makes sense that its phee  since hes somehow like the main main character
i still dont exactly get why por apologized for taking money from non maybe because he wanted money from him at all because so far he obviously didnt steal from him like i first assumed
and im guilty i laughed at nons shirt im sick of everything is such a mood
and i loved how jin is casually watching kinnporsche at school 
ah its really really exciting and thrilling i cant wait to get over all these flashbacks and come back to the present 


not them singing porchays song when filming their short too  that made me snort so badly so many easter eggs
i really like that teachers theory but then is he now dead  and why would only jin see him  or is he part of the revenge team 
also about por thats very interesting did por inquire about what happened hence the newspaper about tees uncle  did whatever happened to non made him want to know what truly happened  and now that consequences are facing him he regrets what for him was the trigger to all this 

which song is it i was about to ask because i didnt know the song but i assumed it was an easter egg
por told us in the beginning that the people who make the sacrifice for the cult also kill themselves at the end so maybe the teacher sacrificed non and also killed himself
about por i dont know it felt like he regrets what happened back then since he apologized for it and said i shouldnt have taken the money from you but in the other hand before he was very chilled with tee while they were talking when they got the camera upstairs in the room tee said what if they find out and he was like yeah whatever its over why should they care or something like that


its the song from kinnporsche that porchay barcodes character writes for kim his love interest  its this song is called you barcode has two songs at the moment no more dreams and this one huhu
damn that would be gruesome but then where does jin go in here 
yeah but por being and egoistical spoiled boy with too high expectations that destroyed him as a person maybe only properly reflected while half dead on his couch 

yeah thats what i meant regarding por 
thank you for the song i havent watched kp yet so thanks for the spoilerfree description d
mhhhh i dont know i doubt that non told jin about his plan  its hard to spin further because i dont know how much jin knows

bruh i just finished the episode and i actually screamed at the last scene and the preview like wtf phee is nons secret  on the phone 
im shocked i tell you absolutely shocked and how do phee  jin end up fwb when they both seemed to be crushing on non 
im so sad for non and i want to put tee on the list next fr


i though is that phee wants revenge for what they did to his boyfriend


oh my god i am so ready for more
as someone who wants less established closed couples of actors i love the perspectives
damn i dont know what i am allowed to discuss here lets jump
so phee is there for revenge probably got tan with him on it as planned beforehand kudos to people that has this on their theories 
they were friend with benefits and then boyfriends  or is that just phees line but its actually said to jin 
barcodes acting daaamn dude
sammon really looked at him and was like people love you and you cry well lets traumatise you so much as she should
also i have to give it to us he does not look one year older than the rest of the group great acting
tees character is incredible so stuck in a bad place but no will to go out can he  probably not but he doesnt even try anymore really looking forward to how white enters the picture
we still havent seen non strangling top so they will go back in the woods later how  why 
tas arrival  i loved it even with the spoilers i already had i was so ready
so many layers of story
so non is someone with a mental sickness so many pills a disappointment compared to his big brother a source of dispute between his parents probably both for his mental sickness and his upbringing damn what a life
and damn do a lot of people have the hots for that boy as they should he is glorious

im so invested in this the layers to all of this unfolding is just  im so intrigued in seeing how tf phee plays into everything that happened in the woods 


there are layers and so many details did you catch that the news channel is called boc for beoncloud  
i want more this is really so much more than just a slasher serie
i am imagining exaggeratedly of course then pitching the idea to ta  so dude youre gonna be steamy with copper of course but also in love and steamy maybe  i kinda hope with barcode also you will violently avenge him in blood with any weapons of your choice
we dont really know but phee has to be around for a reason i really hope non is around too
i have to go back to my analysis thread and see we came to happen and what is still pending 


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i liked that jin was watching kinnporsche on his tablet i see you vegas you cant get past me

at least can we be a couple is something he says safe to non since we see his mouth moving to the words


yeah in between i went to rewatch the last scene and the first part of the preview at least 20 times and realised that 
as much as i did not like macauporchay damn am i invested in pheenon such a word play on the classic we are phi nong pheenonjin and any variation of that


throuple yas lol too bad this isnt one of those series where non went and got plastic surgery and became white lol


i dont know why the plastic surgery doesnt appeal to me
now the throuple though thats something i can get 1000 behind


i meant in some revenge series people may get plastic surgery or lose a lot of weight maybe i watched too many lakorns


yeah i heard that type of theory with phee being non then tan or white being non  i dont watch lakorns  that may explain why the idea is so alien to me


this series is seriously fun it makes everyone guess we are all going to be doing this


yeah its crazy we have no script no book to be based on and anything can happen with these guys
sherlock homlsing to the extreme 
i never went second by second to analyse trailers for bl before that
this is really compelling like its excellent storytelling on top of which its a healthy bl no homophobia they are in simple relationships its even fun the homosexuality is the simplest part of the plot 


pretty much the extremes are the adults from parents both rich and poor as well as those mafia scammer pyramid schemers to the possibly pervy culty kinda hot teacher
i hope they write a novel that uses the drama and gives us different povs and extras that fill in time gaps that theres not enough time for the series to use since its only 12 episodes


yeah its not a surprise that pheenon knew each other since the thai nicknames always have a connection if they are used in this way the question was only if they are siblings or lover  i would have loved if tan was  but as i said in another comment it makes sense that its phee also given the fact that hes something like the main main character kinda leader of the group etc


so i went back to watch nomoredream mv because of course i am obsessed and hyper fixating
maybe the second person in the mv is ta there is a faint trace of his tattoo on a finger in one pictures
also the preview show is phee and non next to a body of water in the mv its phee and jin that are near a very similar body of water jin is often show a with stripes and he appears in clip behind barcode singing multiple times phee is holding a camera these are mixed with jinnon shots
they are muddying the trail so much my dudes
and someone holding a nice picture of teeportopflukejin and non after filming non is holding the terror mask so its the part we are still missing where non strangles top and plays the bad guy

do you mean this httpsxcommintyqrtstatus1749809323960889474s20



yup  i dont have x its too toxic for me to bear so i missed this  thank you dont you think the place is similar to the one phee and non cuddle in in the preview for next week 

i didnt watch the mv so its hard to say but yeah could be and i dont use x often someone in mdl linked the theories of the person and i find them interesting so i just come back to read their stuff 

this show is amazing i dont think theres been a bl before where the main couple got turned upside down and im sat like even if it ends as pheejin now they have to work for it oh god im so excited


the revenge plot is clearer now pheenon id like to know morejin is innocent and kind i dont get any malice and bully vibes from himi think he likes nontee is just a criminal dont care about his reasonstop is an ahole who thinks only of himselffluke is aware but does nothingpor is a spoiled brat who runs to mommywill see how all these unfolds

that bullying is brutal poor non
but i loved that jin was watching kinnporsche on his break and tabarcode im excited 
its really well done big thumbs up to the cinematographer screenwriter and director 



bocs cinematography
damn this show is fucking incredible there is so many threads barcodes acting was phenomenal this episode no wonder everyone is in love with him i loved the way that they showed how jin was falling for non  how everything was fading away for him except non and his voice and he was just pulled to him like a magnet professor is giving big red flags why was he targetted as an effigy of leaves what did you do keng
we see that phee isnt what he seems but i still think neither is white he saw himself covered in boils and there is the supernatural element im still wondering if hes secretly evil tee is a very interesting character hes absolutely doing dick move shit but hes caught in a tough spot too so hes not good but hes not wholly bad either i need to know how this whole thing comes together because its so damn interesting
also por and his entire family can fucking die oh wait  por already did hahahahaha


we think alike here  also love your flair
i really dont know where to stand with keng but 2j acting is impressive i barely recognise him and he goes that line between creepy and caring with mastery i am a teacher myself and he makes my head spin
white hides something thats what i think too but i wonder how he fits in the rest trailers have me the feeling that he targeted tee and was the one to pursue him romantically
they give us crumb by crumb thats really masterful


bocs cinematography
at first i thought tees line in the first episode about you said youd behave if you came was tee being controlling but honestly what if it was to keep white in line we already know that tee associates with bad people  maybe white is involved with that part of his life somehow
if white is some evil janta cult acolyte i will be gagged gooped and gooned


maybe since white came unto tee tee sees him as a flirt and see any interactions he has as flirty  dunno

are you implying that white is not as pure as he seems interesting 


i definitely think he is not if not simply because every character we saw is multidimensional and i dont really see the author being like everyone has a back story and multiple layers and is grey or plain black except you my special snowflake cinnamon role who did nothing wrong 

white  non both fall into this box for me which is why im hoping the show lends more nuance to them like at least jin has the depth of being friends with questionable characters and going along with the whole scheme etc but so far white and non are presented as completely innocent


in fairness non is the victim whose desperately lonely and in need of friends so the pure part we see is still nuanced in his pain and becomes layered in becoming presumably the psycho murderer

white always striked me as such an interesting character i really need to see white and tees backstory to make some proper judgement
but right now i think him tan and phee are definitely working on something together because i remember when the three of them plus jin were talking and idk would you get along with your friends boyfriends that well
i think rn my guess is that white has something to do with the revenge so im just rly curious to see whether hes with tee for his plan or he got together before then learnt the truth about him still the way he didnt question anything about tees uncle when fluke asked him rly got me thinking def not a normal relationship

i am not sure for me the teacher is alone involved in the cult where on the other hand we have phee tan and white together
we know nons parents have money problems we also know that non isnt really interested in staying alive the teacher in the preview offers him money in exchange for his life at least that is what it sounds like so my theory is the teacher gives him money non takes it to help his parents and therefore gets sacrificed for the cult  which is a winwin for non since he doesnt want to live anymore and suicide doesnt seem to work since everyone is interrupting all the time  and maybe phee also keeps a closer eye on him now


i kind of agree with you but those little staring contests the teacher and non had rly put me on edge i actually thought the teacher was nons  just because of the staring do you think that tension was like because he wants to buy non or something else


i dont know the time line for phee and ji being friends with benefit but i assume phee started it after whatever happened to non i remember when they mentioned that they became friends with the gang a year after nons disappearance
so my theory is that they all had long term plan for revenge phee tan but i feel white can be the older brother or someone they know because he is so far removed from the story that his place in the story seems cruel


i knew that phee had to be the brother or the loveri wonder what this means for pheejin does he actually love him or is it just an revenge plot as suspected 


bocs cinematography
it could be both or started as revenge and turned to love im sat for this show


ive seen a theory that phee was two timing both non and jin if that happens it would be so messy 


this would make my head spin

i already feel bad for jin although it was before he met phee and i think phee and non are cute together i dont want two timing being involved 
but since there are also mysterious blurry quotes from the writers about if its really okay if they kill people and split up a couple i just expect the worst and no happy ending for anyone 

nons im sick of everything shirt  just misery upon misery dumped on him and a sketchy af teacher too ew 
so far phi jin and white i guess are in the clear will tee get a redemption arc  he has problems but dragging your classmate into it is such a dick move omg


thats some form of pyramid scheme right there these are the worse



bocs cinematography
pheephibrothernew he was the one that was the most insistent on seeing and remaking the movie
edit well nevermind lol

gladly phinong isnt just used for biological siblings 


like oppa and gege lol

more of hyung since both are guys but both of them are only used for older people so not really a perfect equivalent here 


yes hyung


wowowowow what a twist


the only thing i wonder is why that uncle bringing them food had to die by decapitation in previous episodes lol like did he do something bad


well he is acting in the movie we see him on their reels what does that mean exactly  i dont know but he is part of the stealing of nons work


oh yikes i didnt notice i thought he was innocent lol

it seems like the culprits are reenacting the movie imo

i thought that was to prevent him from helping them leave the houseforest i think hes innocent but they were going to ask him to get help



that was plot twist and poor non pheenon was fwb when they were high schoolers wownon is a silent introvert but also boldjin still seems like a good guy tho and hope tee top will get miserable ends  i dont care tee needs money for his dads medical billsthey brought in an innocent person and drove him to do what he did screw themit must be a delight for tabarcode shipper during kp era and jincopper he really is handsome and talented love this show its getting betterwith barcodes entry like his character makes the story interesting


cmon boc give us something good today 


anybody catch perth around 214 mark btw blue jacket white stripe


cause of death the heart killers 
i just realized he was there because im watching the reaction vids im gonna have to circle back to every onair i couldnt figure out how he was going to fit the plot but he was already there


i am glad i stuck with this show it is really growing on me and i definitely wasnt expecting that ending i might need to do a rewatch asi am sure i have missed loads of clues 


oh god its phee i thought he would be nons brother not the lover but i really like it
definitely he is out for blood and im loving it after what those monsters did to non they deserve hell especially tee and por well he bit the dust already 
phee told jin he wouldnt allow anything happen to him so i wonder if he is in the revenge plan or at least phee knows that like him jin loved non and its innocent
by the way tees uncle appears death at the first of the story in the present day i wonder if phee will kill him for threatening non and the same with the teacher who seems a pervert
im loving this series



another fun ep i am rooting for a pheenon revenge plot and rooting for them to get away with murder lolol barcodes misery was so good i totally relate to phee willing to kill for non because same so hype to watch all those jerks die
however i am somehow still weirdly fond of tee idgi when he was such a dick lmao maybe this is handsometall privilege in action oops i will accept it but be sad if he dies


lmao same about tee honestly i hate him so much but then i see him towering over everyone else and my moral compass disintegrates
tho loving phee being in on the whole non drama curious to see how it plays out


yes super curious also phee being especially hateful towards tee makes sense now that we have this backstory he can fake it with all of them except tee lol

this episode had me shook
when i finished kinnporsche while kimchay were just okay for me i secretly would have loved to see chaymacau and never in a million years did i think i would get it in another universe
im still team pheejin though but im going to enjoy tabarcode as much as they will give
poor non just couldnt catch a break like how on earth did things go so wrong
its a first for me to watch a horror setting and root for half the cast to die horribly rather than survive
if non is still alive and getting his revenge its por down and top and tee at least need to pay there is not a single redeemable quality in either of them
fluke and white are still a mystery though i wonder if white is clean he will end up as collateral damage for tee going down


okay so its looking more and more like this is completely planned by humans and like realistic fiction right but what about that dark hand in episode one where tee and white were making out like is that even related to the plot and who would be controlling the hand because theres no way someone was just sitting there omg if this turns into some supernatural thing i dont know if im going to be happy or upset

not him watching kinnporsche at schooli screamed
1112


so i chose the right time to start watching im suddenly not opposed to tabarcode and uhmmm yeah  im too dumb to put 11 together so ill just let the show surprise me


ok got to ep6 nothing seems crazy or unexpected tbh went back to ep1 again and phees scene with jinfor science lol and it is still one of the hottest scenes ta is really giving it his all copper is just so pretty his features are so delicate and they kiss amazing togetheryes i got sidetracked ok
so non getting bullied by all the boys who are trying to cover up the original movie footage no surprise there phee ta being nons lover ok that one is unexpected sort of in ep1 the way phee was acting i 100 thought he was nons best friend or brother or some other close person to non and was coming back under cover to find out what really happened to non or to get revenge for non
also tan when he said he would go under cover with the other side the original movie boys immediately made me think he was secretly plotting with phee and also here undercover so i guess rewatching the hot scene in ep1 between phee and jin makes me think that jin and phee were friends and were hooking up and jin knew that phee was also hooking up with non and maybe it wasnt that jin liked non maybe he was trying to see why phee liked non that triangle is interesting and by interesting i just want ta to make out with copper again tbh  i dont think barcode will make out with anyone tbh so putting all my chips on jin and phee
fluke being a selfish prick and knowing but allowing non to be blamed is onbrand with how he acted throughout no surprise top same tee same por same blah bullies are horrible and i hate them all no redemption bye off with their heads
white is a cutie eventhough binging the episodes make me find him annoying with proper dosing i like white i didnt even like the hot scenes with tee and white because from ep1 tee felt like a coward and a bully
so i only need white jin and phee to survive and non if he wants to make out with white i will take that the rest of them can all disappear honestly no redemption needed  i dont even need them to make out because their bullying immediately unhots them so no need bye bullies off with your heads the tutor teacher sammon makes me think human trafficking  maybe although why did the tutor teacher smile when non got the math question right made me think he would find him useful for gambling and counting cards otherwise why would you want a smart kid for human trafficking purposes


i havent even watched yet but the spoilers ive seen and the hints at next week honestly have me contemplating putting this show on hold until its finished and i know exactly what ive signed up for
considering that ta and copper won thc and this is supposed to be their prize im not really a fan of where this seems to be going though itd explain the lack of marketing for them as a pair it feels like a bit of a bait and switch with pheejin being pushed in the first episode only for everything to be something else entirely
again i havent watched yet but i really dont know if i even want to because the spoilers have left such a bad taste in my mouth
edit having now watched the episode im still not a fan of how they are handling the romances here which is a pity because the rest of the show is well done and layered also i said this in a comment further down but im really not a fan of how non is being centered here in a show that is the prize for thc it just feels unfair to ta and copper to have barcode  who already has a huge following  be centered in their show on top of that his character also lacks the depth that the rest of the characters have because he has no shades of grey to him so far  hes just an innocent baby victim who has done nothing wrong in theory this is fine but it has pitfalls in a show like this where you have other characters doing awful things due to the situations theyre in hopefully this changes
that being said im a tad more hopeful that this isnt just pure revenge for phee but i think i need to put my blromance hopes thoroughly on the backburner for this show and center the horror again and basically expect anythingeverything


do you need to know the endgame in advance to enjoy the show 


its more a matter of deciding whether or not i want to devote my time to something i watch shows because they make me happy or i enjoy them if im going to watch only to be sad and frustrated then i dont see the point you know like i just decided against watching last twilight for example due to spoilers i saw about how it ends i dont need that sort of disappointment
its partly my own fault for forgetting that boc does really push the boundaries of traditional bls etc i know whats typical and expected in horror i love the genre but i didnt expect some of it here because its a bl and i probably shouldnt have let my thoughts go down that path
this show could still be salvageable to me but i think the main fear i have is that itll turn out that phee is faking everything and doesnt have any feelings for jin at all which would really sour my thoughts on how the show presented them and how ta and copper have been treated
edit i dont usually complain but cmon people i dont downvote you for being excited for stuff i dislike so itd be nice if you didnt downvote me for not being happy 

i understand why you wouldnt like it but i like that boc seems to be pushing boundaries and not going the typical bl route but we have to wait  and see what they do with it for the rest of the series 

oh i know  i think im just really nervous about the possibility that theres no feelings there at all partly because some of phees actions will then not make sense if thats the case like why did he save jin in episode four
if this was a horror movie id be completely fine lol im used to this sort of thing scream anyone but its still marketed as a bl and i want my pheejin hahaha plus i really dont like love triangles or cheating and im a little nervous thats whats going on


bocs cinematography
i think the feelings are genuine the way he was in the coffin about protecting jin didnt seem fake unless hes a supreme actor personally i love that they arent doing it the typical bl route since im kind of atypical bl watcher in that my faves are the ones that are about something else besides the romance  im never really a romance first genre person and like the ones that are more just queer content than a straight up romance like moonlight chicken only friends manner of death not me this show etc
im very intrigued at how we got here maybe phee got feelings for jin because jin was the only one of that group who treated non like a human and he at first found solace in him after non disappeared dunno its a shame if you do give up the show because its so damn good but you gotta do what you gotta do its for entertainment after all

the way he was in the coffin about protecting jin didnt seem fake unless hes a supreme actor
yeeeeah whats making me nervous is that this is a tried and true trope in horror  supposedly the one person has feelings but in truth its all a lie and theyre out for revenge and will do anything for it combine that with one of the pairings wont get a happy ending and im very  about it all
i think i just need to adjust my mentality back to this is horror first and foremost and stop worrying about the bl aspect the bl aspect can be saved in fanfic but in the show im just gonna assume that phees out for revenge and nothing more that way i can be pleasantly surprised if he does have genuine feelings after all
oh one thing ill add is that partly what has me feeling so sour about this is the marketingpresentation in the context of the bl genre like in traditional horror its one thing to be sold a relationship and then have it turn out to be all a scheme in bl that feels a bit like dirty play but again boc is a company that wants to push boundaries so its probably my fault for forgetting about that in my excitement about pheejin


i get you im heavily on the pheejin train too but i love this twist  the one thing i wanted was for tabarcode scenes and im getting my wish so im excited  
i dont think phee is playing with jin in the present time otherwise his actions make no sense  he literally only thinks about this boys safety who is getting hurt a lot by the way plus i cant see jin doing anything wrong to non at this point so phee wont touch him
i think non disappears leaves phee broken hearted but hes vengeful  he uses jin to infiltrate the friend group and im sure he catches feelings but he wont take it further cause hes on a mission  
pheenon are my fav characters at this point so im excited to analyze further about their history  but i really want phee to go ballistic on everybody and we know he doesnt back away from a fight so lfg
only thing that throws me off is the damn supernatural element this part stumps me and its annoying 

if you asked me for a list tabarcode would be at the bottom lolol mostly because ta and copper won thc so tbqh part of me is really quite salty on their behalf that this has become the barcode show i adore barcode but dff is supposed to be ta and coppers show not his and he has wuju coming out so the bible fan in me is also steaming about this
i think im going to continue watching under the assumption that phee is just in this for revenge and not expect anything from pheejin it seems like the safest especially with the fact that the writer hinted at one of the pairings not getting a happy ending i just assumed itd be teewhite because you know this was supposed to be ta and coppers show

if the writers actually said that then its still a toss up who gets a happy ending imo we still dont know much about phee and white and thats probably on purpose 


i hope none of us alive so phee  non can be together happily

it was one of the writers back at the beginning talking about how he discussed with boc about what they would let him do and two of the things were whether or not he could really have one of the pairings have an unhappy ending could he really kill off x character etc etc it could all be misdirect but this latest twist has me wondering


sorry if i sounded judging i was just naively wondering by the way  not judgy at all
i really wonder because for now jin has been nothing but lovely and infatuated with non i really wonder how they will meet how they will start their relationship as friends with benefits
i personally love that we dont know where this is going in regard to coupling i love a good old love story like in kp where we knew porsche was never going away from kinn for real etc but i love that more realistically things change and the options are real people and not just challenge to overcome for main couple i started with no opinion tacopper leaves me indifferent even if their first scene was absolute fire so something like that is really interesting
anyway as i will absolutely watch the rest if you need someone to give you info without spoilers i would gladly help 


well hes playing as a side character and his role is really important they are all connected to non if non was not their the whole plot wouldnt make sense and i feel like you are annoyed that non is getting in the way of your pheejin ship when both jin and phee love non and it seems like they still have feelings for him which im happy because those three have amazing chemistry
you should go look at the theories on ticktock because a lot of people think that jin has an obsession with non a lot of people dont trust jin they are sus of himmy heart broke for phee especially when he was crying silently during the first confrontation about non and keng phee would have walked through fire for non if only he knew about what was going on i really wanted phee to understand that non was basically groomed by keng but it would be unrealistic to expect teenager to think that far
at the same time i felt so sad for non he is back to being alone now that the only person who loved him is left i dont see what non did as cheating per se because i think non was overwhelmed but didnt want to burden phee with his problems so he basically fell into kengs arms when keng showed him the slightest bit of concern
i was also rooting for jin to stand up to his asshole friends but nah bro has no spine oh well i guess its realistic for teens to succumb to peer pressure and bully others or be a bystander
now ill just wait for phee to enact whatever master plan he has to yeet all these mofos off the face of earth


and seriously jin your first reaction upon seeing your teacher and your underage crush doing the bam bam in the ham ham is to film it rather than call the popo teenagers arent the best decision makers especially when emotional but this takes the cake

its very agetypical though hell even a lot of adults would look at this and label it just sex and that keng isnt doing anything wrong jin was wrong to record it but as an angry heartbroken teen in love i can kind of understand he wasnt thinking clearly


yes i agree and this is the impression i get so i look forward to seeing how th storyline with the leaked video proceeds as i assume they will just push it under the rug


bam bam in the ham ham
i rolled hahahahahahaha but yes jin lost all my respect this episode in the past persons were saying he is just as bad as the friends he keeps but today he proved it sigh

fujoshi
yeah im getting really tired of jin always comforting non but never actually doing anything to help him


cause of death the heart killers 
i was also rooting for jin to stand up to his asshole friends but nah bro has no spine oh well i guess its realistic for teens to succumb to peer pressure and bully others or be a bystander
definitely i cant blame them for being teenagers but i still hoped for the best and was crushed to be proven otherwise comment image

not me pausing every 2 mins  absolutely losing my mind phee has been my favorite character from the start and this ep really solidified that
i feel bad for non he was going through so many things at once and on top of that some creep ass teacher just had to come and groom him
im excited to watch how exactly phee plays into everything in the present day and how exactly his complicated relationship with jin started  next week cant come fast enough

the pheejin relationship is sort of twisted if you think about it phee seems like hes trying to find out what happened to non and it seems like during the process he falls for jin meanwhile jin was sort of the catalyst for the nonphee break up  it could be a sad ending for them  because im assuming non is dead 


cause of death the heart killers 
unless phee already knows about jin posting that clip when they reunite im kinda digging all these plot twists because it seems they were really well thought of since the beginning and they werent just writing thinking what next im so here for this series tbh

it was left vague if jin posted the clip or not it seemed like he didnt and it may be one of the other boys  i have doubts that phee and jin knew about each other prior to nons disappearancedeath they kept having near misses this episode probably on purpose when they finally tell each other the truth its gonna be a big moment in the show 


cause of death the heart killers 
definitely they didnt know each other before non disappeared but i do believe that things might still happen before we go back to the future
but its true that he uploaded the clip to that drive and that anyone might have got to it and posted it anyways he did record it and he was responsible of leaving it to the others mercy


unless phee already knows about jin posting that clip when they reunite
agreed at this point anybody could be manipulating and we do not know


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant wait for the upcoming weeks the plot is really tight


yessssssssss what i love is we know part of the future so we can answer some questions we had from there and accept some deaths as those characters are garbage


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant wait for top to bite the dust 


yesssssss i call front row seats to that demise


cause of death the heart killers 
since joffrey baratheon i havent been this invested in someones demise 


yesssssssss joffrey was the target of all my disgust during my got days i see were like minded individuals 

hun i had to pause and go eat my dinner and when it ended i was shaking what a trainwreck best watch for me in months
i 50 agree with non and the teacher i hate when people do something nice and need something in return but when non leaned him and kissed him back i was like wtffff

it took me two hours to finish watching because i had to keep pausing to process what i was seeing non should be happy and it sucks sooooooo many things keep pushing him in the direction hes going
i wish jin had a backbone when it comes to his friends ultimately im here for phee and idc what happens to everyone else
people dont act like that with their brother smh


cause of death the heart killers 
i almost let a sigh of relief when he said nong and 1 second later he was leaning in comment image


yesss i saw brothers in the subtitles and was saying oh thank the most high then he leaned in and i was like ummmmmmmm no sir


cause of death the heart killers 
i was screaming no no no no which my dog translated into i must leave the premises i sounded so disgusted


hahahahahahahahaha i hate when someone does something nice and wants something in return as you wonder if it is genuine but when non went back in for the kiss i was flabbergasted and wanted to know what is going through his mind i think he is a master manipulator or he likes the thrill i was shaking when the episode ended as i was sooo stressed


cause of death the heart killers 
he just got 300000 baht i think he thought it was the least he could do 


 im pissed because he should have told his boyfriend first and then see how that works out but kiss and sex with your teacher out of nowhere makes me question his intentions


cause of death the heart killers 
teenagers not always make the best decisions 


neither do many adults


cause of death the heart killers 
true that 


same


keng i see you as a brother
me aww thats great non definitely could use someone like that and
keng kisses non
me facepalm nevermind pretend i didnt say anything
seriously what kind of relationship does keng have with his brothers d

this is honestly one of the best bl ive seen in a while i was turned off by the horror premise but stuck with it and now its definitely in the running for one of my favorite bl ever the one thing i really appreciate about this show is how intricately written it is every single character has good believable motivations for their actions that range across the morality spectrum and you find yourself vacillating between how you feel about characters from one episode to the next i love it sammon and the rest of the writing team did that also as spineless as he is fluke is the only character im really behind excluding non and phee of course


cause of death the heart killers 
yep all of this it really is captivating and fore people that were complaining about the uneveness of kps story this one is keeping it tight im in awe


its definitely in the running for one of my favorite bl ever
the episode literally left me shaking the last time i had this feeling was watching shadow and to sir with love i am hooked and genuinely surprised as i did not expect it


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
oh jin



ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
upon reevaluation though it doesnt seem like he sent it before the laptop died i wonder if this was a misdirect if he put it on a shared drive or something that the other group members could see its super plausible that one of them was the one that did it
honestly though even if jin wasnt the one to send it nons life was basically ruined by jin having a crush on him jin brought him into the group which set off the money problems is convincing him to stay to finish the film etc
poor phee  also i had to pause about 1 minute in because excuse me papa phee who is he he is an absolute snack
the tutor is the worst and im glad he will apparently die painfully based on the bloody ghost vision they saw in the previous episode


yesssssssssssssssssssssss exactly my feelings but i guess he is the perfect representation of show me your friends and i tell you who you are sigh

poor non what else are they gonna put this poor kid through ffs
actually poor phee 
but still poor non hes only doing this stuff because he feels like he has no other choice


bocs cinematography
non has been made so desperate by everything around him that hes making bad decisions ie lying to phee about the money and about keng preying on him phee would have moved the world to help non which is the saddest part

one of my youtubers said she thinks non is a master manipulator and i am inclined to agreee as i am wondering if he is using his pitiful attitude to get his way secretly


he is manipulating whom his life is a misery one after another did he force the teacher to rape him the only reason he lied to phee was a mixture of shame and not wanting to get him involved in his miserable situation

this show has me so good with the way i was ready to abandon it last week and got sucked back in anyway 
i feel terrible for whats happening but at the same time im also thrilled at execution of some character development that i had been hoping and waiting for
we finally got two things non shifting from being purely an innocent character who has done and can do no wrong particularly in audience perception to someone who is more nuanced than that and insight into phee
i think its very likely that non has been abused or had something happen to him in the past or perhaps its just the family dynamics and what hes facing at home but either way its clear that he has a few things going on hes desperate for physical affection hes depression hes anxious he feels the need to take care of himself and not be a burden to anyone all of these drive his behaviour and make him make terrible decisions that are also completely understandable and human
also i just want to state this clearly non is not cheating he is being sexually coerced by his teacher there is a difference where he goes wrong is in lying to phee and manipulating him into second guessing his thoughts etc and it seems that hes cheated in the past and thats obviously wrong but when it comes to whats going on with keng he is clearly being manipulated and coerced
i feel so badly for phee after this episode right from the start i felt like there was more to what was going on there and that thered be an explanation for him having jin at arms length etc and i got it i feel so badly for him also im more sure than ever unless boc really does go down the stonecold killer route that his involvement with jin isnt just revenge we saw how upset he was about non and how he feels about cheating i just cant see him using sex as a weapon like okay if he used it to get close to jin in the past but again in the forest it just doesnt click for me
and my poor baby boy jin i wondered what changed him from the fairly happygolucky boy in the past to how he seems in the present and i got the answer personally i dont think that hes the one who released the recording we saw his laptop short out so at the least we know that he didnt do it deliberately theres also a scene earlier in the show where fluke talks to white tee and tan about a video being released and since we know that white and tan arent involved my money is on tee top or por having been the ones who did it theres a screenshot floating around that shows icloud drive in the sidebar so im guessing jin saved it somewhere the others could access it
also im amazed at how many layers we have going on here
we have
pheejinnon
nonkeng
non vs the bullies
the money laundering
kengs sidebar with the investigative reporter
the mystery in the past  the mystery in the present
how do white  tan fit in
who does perth play lol
and there are still so many questions we need answers to what happened to non what happened to keng how did tees uncle end up dead
is it next saturday yet


your second paragraph put my feelings into words
i did not have enough and had way too much at the same time
damn was that good


so they really looked at barcode and were like  so you did not kiss anyone during kp  yeah thats sad lets have you kiss people now 
i mean he only misses us and he pinned the whole exkp cast 
oh god these kengnon had me so uncomfortable i had to walk back and forth in my homeroom to try to disperse some awkwardness while tabarcode was unexpectedly excellent and cathartic 2jbarcode was close to incest in my brain 
also i am now going to go watch the start of the episode over and over and act as if thats the only part that aired thank you
for real now that serie is truly incredible that whole episode was great and still did not answer half the questions we have about current time i am barely coherent
shits about to go down next week 
also ta your the mvp we talk about barcodes acting and boy is our code excellent and brilliant again and again but tas acting is brilliant too he was getting there but he just entered with burnished letters my bl actors hall of fame


me before the episode  daaamn i hope that tabarcode are going to kiss
me starting the episode  holy spaghetti


i had to pause and go and take a drink of water as i was shook


i was cooking and giggling crazily my husband was like the hell happens with your pasta

boc really waited for barcode to hit 18 before rubbing their hands together and giving him all the kisses and sex whewww 
im with you im also replaying and living in the first scene in fact i wont lie i felt transported back into kp and kept imagining an au where chay hooks up with macau while heartbroken over kim


that was such a whiplash for me like i was like oh i hope baby barcode has a kissing scene he never had one guess what hahah he has sex with 2j
but phee is so much more sensitive and cute than macau who let us be honest did not really have a personality apart from being spoiled i love my phee and i love ta if i could i would send him all the kudos and the love because damn that glow up


yeah the entire scene for me was like nonuh uhno way theyll show thatnonoooonononono 
ta is definitely coming into his own in this series i actually thought his acting was a bit weak in the first couple eps since there were some scenes where i could tell he was reciting his lines vs acting them and pausing between words for dramatic effect it was more noticeable for me since i understand thai though after this ep i am a firm taphee believer and would follow him to any other series he lands


damn i envy you for understanding thai the syntaxe is so different from what i am used to i can only recognise isolated words i wish sometimes i could remove the burden of the translation it sometimes feel unfaithful

yeah thats sad lets have you kiss people now 
no to mention he was on his back getting it blown out hahahahahahahaha
in kp not even a proper kiss and now is he doing the deed like it is nothing i am shook
agreed that the first part was beautiful and that ta and barcode are doing the damn thing


cause of death the heart killers 
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
when i tell you i screamed this show is blowing my mind its going where we havent gone before with a young cast like this im shocked
like theyve been selling tacopper but boy those of us that were shipping tabarcode in kp we were served those first minutes of this episode then creepy teacher got real creepy and i screamed so loud my dog went outside thinking i was scolding him my husband came to check on me and everything non is really going the tstl path going back to those friends they bully him he knows they are only taking advantage of him i need to know whats in it for him it must not be only the movie jin what were you thinking he was all jealous and he had only a lousy attempt at kissing non what in the entitlement was that
now phee i remember we wanted him to suffer a little bit after what he seemed to have done to jin but boy i get it i totally get it he gave his heart to non and he was crushed and i suppose hes gonna learn about jin posting that clip and i ugh those are gonna be the last words hes gonna say to non right ominous
my heart this episode was everything and now we are getting non embracing wholeheartedly his villain era bring it on


oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
i was shaking after the episode ended that i had to take a walk and watch something else to calm down that was the biggest trainwreck i have watched in a while it was soooo bad and sooo good at the same time i am shocked how hooked i was


cause of death the heart killers 
thank the bl gods i left fluffy cherry magic at the end because it was so heartwrenching i just cant deal right now i also replayed the first 6 min of the episode because i was a tabarcode shipper way back when and i feel vindicated


yesssssssssssss tabarcode from kp days they gave me the life i wanted to see in kp but sadly it did not last long in this show but i am sooo excited to see how it proceeds


cause of death the heart killers 
they had only lived in ao3 fanfics but our patience was rewarded 


bocs cinematography
i was like am i reading the side couple in one of my own fanfics truly wild


cause of death the heart killers 


fujoshi
god poor non
part of me wants to say why doesnt he just get away from those bullies or why doesnt he just tell the teacher no but i also understand why it isnt that simple why should he let them make the film without him and take all the credit when hes the one who wrote it and obviously when it comes to the teacher i cant blame him for that he feels obligated because of the money and of course the fault should always fall with the creepy ass teacher in this situation because of the power imbalance
but i still feel very bad for non he cant catch a break i do not feel sympathy for jin talking about waaah i didnt mean to upload the video but like you drafted the tweet if you were a good friend you wouldnt have ever even done that taking the video i understand i thought he would use it to help non report the teacher but that wasnt the case
i wish non would just tell his friends that tee is the one behind the shady bank accounts also im curious how phee ends up getting involved with the rest of the group i appreciate these flashback episodes of course but i am also eager to get back to the present to see what will happen next in conclusion fuck all those people except non and phee poor babies 

heartbreaking how phee is trying his best but hes just too young too inexperienced for the problems non is going through
barcode killing it this week again he really mustve impressed them with his crying scene in kp ya boy is crying enough to flood the world
jin 


this is exactly why in the future phee could not commit to jin non ruined him and this is how good men turn bad


okay it makes a lot of sense that barcode had to stress so much that he was an adult making his own decisions this role is getting more and more complex and theres still more to go though i feel like next episode will be climax of his arc after which we will return to the present
the beginning montage was everything ta and barcode have consistently given us top notch aesthetics the way they fit together is unreal they were cute yet sexy truly the sweetheart romance anyone would ever want
the way it contrasts with the badwrong aesthetic of barcode and jj is a whiplash ngl i need to put a genuine apology i did think jj would be a nice wholesome teacher who just happened to be super hot but i guess no such thing
still cant believe such a show actually exists and got made and next saturday is too far away


bocs cinematography
im loving how this show is structured in three acts just an educated guess this is how its going to unfold act 1 eps 14 the present setting the scene act 2eps 58 the backstory act 3 eps 912 back to the present with the new info resolutionrevenge
also with the newbie gang of phee tan and white  supernatural stuff happened in front of phee and tan but they didnt see it but white saw himself with boils all over him which has nothing to do with any of the other supernatural stuff thus far is he tied with kent and the cult

this episode was nuts best ep so far
the pheenon relationship montage in the beginning was soo cute its clear that phee wouldve taken a bullet for non the whole red bracelet breaking in the end too ah
i cant wait for how the remaining unfolds


godddddd the first scene absolutely served in the tabarcode department now i feel spoiled and want an actual tacode series to happen  they were so soft so warm together ugh just makes me want to ignore what happened throughout the rest of the episode  boc was ready to drop barcode into all the mature scenes once he turned 18 lol
2j you are hot and i love you as a person but wow you play the creeper teacher so well i couldnt even enjoy your shirtlessness because the scene with non made me so uncomfortable non looked absolutely anxiousscared during those scenes like ugh im so sad non got groomed by this man and probably thinks he has to repay him with his body to feel like he doesnt owe him anything also side note i wonder if the ghost of keng that we see earlier in the series is because keng was investigating the boys at their set and got caught and killed by a hitman sent by tees boss based on the ep preview 
and jin i trusted you he had so many opportunities to actually help non but didnt act on them  and when he finally did something it ended up ruining non and phee he mightve not been the one to actually leak the sex tape but he was def complicit for filming it in the first place gah there better be a redemption arc for him if they want me to get behind pheejin when were back in the present 
regardless of all the drama and feelings im sooooooo pumped for the next episode this show keeps on giving in the meantime you can find me replaying the first couple of scenes over and over again pretending that its an extension of my happy macauchay fantasies 

boc was ready to drop barcode into all the mature scenes once he turned 18 lol
2j you are hot and i love you as a person but wow you play the creeper teacher so well
lmao me starting this episode man i hope barcodes comfortable enough to do a kiss scene
me by the end of it not like this 



bocs cinematography
holy fuck what an episode
 these people are all so fucking punchable por and top especially us and jet are doing a great job with just looking like smug pieces of shit im so glad that por died in agony lol
 even though tee sucks massive shits i still kinda like him where por and top are just absolutely selfish narcissists and fluke is so fucking spineless and only caring about being a doctor tee has some dimensions to him hes obviously in his life to help his father and in the present we see that while top and fluke are only out for themselves tee at least cared about white so he has the capacity to care about others and also the capacity to be a complete asshole
 well we all knew that keng was a giant predator
 jin jin jin holy fuck i did not expect that to happen it makes sense though  he is the nicest one of this group but he still hangs out with them so he definitely had the capacity to be shitty he immediately knew that hed done bad though he fucking ruined nons life with one click because he was jealous and upset which hes a teenager so it does make sense
 phee is so in love with non he would or at least would have gone through hell for him and is currently going through hell for him the way ta and barcode acted the first confrontation was so good and the way non crumpled just a little in phees arms when they hugged  if only youd just been up front about everything non phee would have helped you but now this paints phee and jin so differently than even we thought last week from week to week the perspectives are changing i cant wait to rewatch this show afterwards with all the new perspectives
 damn next week looks like non is going to lose it i cant wait to see it
this show is so goddamn good


in my villain era
i like that all the motivations make sense ever choice a character is making is based in reality of their situation im not having to do mental gymnastics to justify it


bocs cinematography
yes yes yes exactly everything makes sense  they are acting like very realistic teenagers with dumb decision making that isnt just for plot but feels like what would really happen with these mentally flawed characters when teenagers like these who have stripes of shittiness in their personality are met with emotional situations and have zero critical thinking skills this kind of stuff happens
this show is so good its so much more than just a horror show or a bl show or a psychological thriller show its everything and more


he is the nicest one of this group but he still hangs out with them so he definitely had the capacity to be shitty
yessssssssssssssssss i guess he is the perfect representation of show me your friends and i tell you who you are sigh


honeslty as much as i try to hate tee he just keeps serving i mean the dimesionality of him is honestly incredible easily one of the best thought out characters ive ever seen the way that his bullying of non caused like literally everything but still doesnt do petty things like shove non is so psychopath i love it but hate him i still wanna believe that white doesnt like him at all but bro is so hot like do i blame him if he actually does
idk im going through it rn especially after that one smirk haha i wanna know all the white theories tho the two characters who get in my brain the most xd

i just want to say one thing  boc really have gold on their hands with their actors the emotions i felt while watching this episode  from sadness to frustration to feeling sick to my stomach it all felt so raw as if i was there experiencing whatever the characters were i hardly get to feel so connected and emotionally affected by a bl series but this one is doing it for me
i dont understand why this series is so underrated  although its been gaining popularity i still think its one of those gems that deserves to be appreciated more maybe people are put off by the horror aspect of it and this is why theyre not giving it a chance but anyways i hope more and more will get to appreciate dff in the future
now about the episode i am so curious to find out exactly what the friend group did to non and i think that well be getting the answer to that question next week also i am excited for when the flashbacks are over and we are back to the present because now ill be watching with a so much more different perspective and will be seeing all the characters from different lenses the mystery is so good and this whole is there something supernatural or not thing keeps me on my toes too
another thing i cant wait to find out is whether the theories about tan being nons older brother are true or if not how did he get involved with those shitty ass friends same as white im so curious about how he ended up with all of them too i cant wait to see if phee and jin are working together and exactly how much do they know of each other and of course the main mystery  is non alive and who is the murderer
speaking of jin i am so disappointed in him first of all his first reaction when seeing non with the teacher was to pull out the phone and record then he posted said video sorry but with this he hurt non so much more than tee por and the others ever did ive been cheering for him even if it always rubbed me the wrong way how he knew how much his friends hurt non how he knows what they did for him to disappear and decides to stay with them despite it but in this ep he reached a different low unless it turns out he wasnt the one who posted the video i wont be rooting for him and phee

wow what an episode people making bad decisions left and right and it just snowballed at the end 

omgggg barcode and ta were such babies in kinnporsche and now theyre all grown up and soo talented 
oh my god and i thought the bullying couldnt be worse i
this is literally the best show thats airing right now the story suspense in every minute wow

bocs cinematography
i cant stop thinking about this episode if the quality keeps up like this its going to be my fave bl ever along with moonlight chicken
one thing ive been wondering though  did we see the suicide attempt out of order chronologically did phee come back to help him after the breakup because after he cooled down he started connecting dots and couldnt reach non and got worried i mean he wouldnt have been so furious if he didnt deeply care for and love non


i think the message where non voices his fear of prison is right after the suicide attempt at the end of ep6


in my villain era
this episode woke up and choose violence lot of people are not going to be happy there is so much to like about this series i quite like the complexity of nons character and this episode is absolutely his villian origin story its be nice if we could get some more horror but looks like next week non is going to come unhinged
3252  surprise kiss
4204  oh boy we finally got some spice but probably not the one you want


cause of death the heart killers 
this episode woke up and choose violence
it chose murder i barely got to the other end alive
i barely got to the other side alive

phees cop dadnon should have listened to pheechanged schoolsnon why cant you see and feel what theyre doing to youyou keep coming back for more abusehave you no sense of pride and self preservationwhat do you hope to achievethese are shitty peopleeven jin is not enoughomg nonwhat kind of vibe does non give off theres phee jin now creeper teacher this comes with that condition where he takes lotsa medscreeper teacher will not give that much money for nothingone big stink bomb just blew up in their faces

my heart breaks for phee im gonna defend phee with everything i have
also jin turned out to be such an asshole so disappointed with him

ive had phee apologist in my bio since early on because i was sure that there had to be more than him just being a fuckboy who broke jins heart 
i still feel for jin though he got his heart broken and reacted instinctively

cause of death the heart killers 
those first 5 min have me with horny tears and the widest grin ever its not gonna last i know but boy they are so cute



profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
my heart broke for phee 

im screaming and crying and throwing hands and pulling out my hair 
wtf are they doing to non he ended up hurting phee because of all these idiots
phee is like the best thing that happened to non and because of a bunch of insecure loosers non ended up lying and hurting phee  im shaking ffs 
what did non ever do to anyone for them to bully him so much to take advantage of him so much and i was freaking having hopes that jin was a good person but god damn what the heck when he did that i was screaming into my pillow for 10 minutes straight 
i wanna take them all put them in a bag and throw them to the sharks along with those stupid scammers
and to know phee end up with jin later on not knowing what jin did 

i just want to see the reaction tomorrow  barcode was like  guess what im an adult now so how many kiss do you want  
i just want lightening the mood because im so mad right now and i still believe jin is innocent  it wasnt him 


just stab me please it would hurt less 
that aside i seriously need tabarcode to be a permanent thing boc pls hear me out


tabarcode are so good together i feel like boc dont intend on pairing them up together in anything else so they used this opportunity to give people what they kept asking for since kinnporsche tabarcode even though it wont end with them together


well in conclusion nons life sucks and all murders by him will feel justified
i mean im assuming its him 
keng 
phee 
jin 

in light of this episode i went back to watch from the beginning and sooo many dropped hints are making sense but theres still so much to figure out the show opens with jin and non being hunted by the masked figure but where does that land in the timeline is there more than one killer as i type i can only come up with more questions
theres also the aspect of how do tan and white fit into this group we know they come into play in 12th grade so how do they and phee become key parts of the group this show is going to do my head in lol a week is too long for the next episode

is there a novel for this series

well i wanted tabarcode scenes and boy did i get them  what a rollercoaster
dont come for me but theres only so much of the constant pile on of a character that i can take before i just get annoyed with the story im ready for a break from non its just too much all the time i get theyre showing us how he gets to his breaking point but ive been over it and i do considering it cheating in a really disgusting manner and he lied to his boyfriends face he digs his holes deeper and doesnt use the brain hes got
phees the  for me this episode only confirmed what i knew i couldnt help but feel he was being manipulated this whole time by non i thought ta was wonderful esp when he sees nonpedophile teacher coming down the escalator together
im ready to jump forward in the flashback to tanwhitepheejin parts


bocs cinematography
i dont see it as cheating so much as the lying part keng groomed non when he was at his most emotionally vulnerable but the fact that he didnt tell phee about the money in the first place and then about having sex with keng when phee asked him outright twice if there was anything he was hiding that was the part that broke phee if non had asked for help with the money or with help with keng phee would have given it to him i mean he already got a police investigation fixed for him

yeah im sure the lying part hurt the worst for phee non was wrong for that 

its not cheating hes being sexually coerced by his teacher it seems possible to me that he may have been abused in the past would explain a whole lot about his characterization and mental health
like fault him for lying to phee sure 100  but dont call him being preyed on by his teacher cheating

a comment definitely not cheatinghe was preyed on and taken advantage of



sorry if my post triggered or pissed anyone off ill admit i posted this right after it aired so i was irritable venting and typing 
of course this is way more nuanced way more complex than cheating and i know its all being ripped away from him but i still view non as still having his own agency at least at this point so the choice he made to lie not be honest is what burns the worst and the escalator scene just came off so casual on his part
im ride or die for phee at this point i just always want him to have the upper hand but that wouldnt be interesting at all so ill just have to deal with it cause i cant quit the show now that its gotten good
i thought his story was a revenge story but now im really not sure anymore he might reluctantly get pulled back in by someone else like new
glad im rewatching last twilight to offset this show mhokday definitely help with the feels


im speechless at this episode barcode acting is so damn good im   hahahahhahahaa bro but ngl the teacher is kinda hot  and the fact he gave non money  sugar daddy vibes fr  but is the teacher a bad guy or something


the characters i despite are tee his so horrible fluke just goes with the crowd top blames everything he does on someone else or gets his friends to fix his problems por is horrible hes very arrogant and superficial he thinks having money gives him status jin is such a bystander he literally watching his get bullied rather than to help him no back bone he should grow one non is literally just a victim whos just succumbing to peer pressure non literally is naive and believes that those group of people are his friends when in reality just using him to escape from their own problems when non has his own problems phee is literally such a sweetheart hes so in love with non that he would go to the end of the world with him literally do anything for him and mr kang that teacher is a groomer who just using non for his sexual pleasures which is disgusting since non is literally underaged


i also want to add when i first watched this series i thought to myself that no one is innocent in this no matter how innocent the story portrays them as


i am interested in watching this but i hate horror does anyone have the timestamps for the scary stuff on all the released episodes so i can skip it


oh man what an episode this might be an unpopular opinion but non certainly just keeps digging his own hole deeper and deeper making a bunch of shitty decisions even if desperate at this point im kind of done with him im sorry
also phee is such a champ im very curious how this situation with him and jin will work out since jin leaked that video and all phee better be alive by the end of this
also damn jin i did not see that one coming

where do yall watch the episode

im at work still processing this episode i was struggling with a lot of the bullying hi autistic sense of justice but this episode was tough to get through i need to go back and rewatch the series so far because theres so many different truths coming out but also i get jin liked non but he never tried saying anything and his attempts to save non from his friends felt weak idk idk idk its so much to work through

still watching the episode but so far nons shirts are always on point love them


probably you wont believe me but i swear i was having anxiety watching the episode and i was not wrong
oh non my poor child you were so obsessed with not needing help that you ended up hitting rock bottom
im so glad that the teacher ends up dead in the present he rd a teenager using money and nons despair
jin didnt leak the video but he clearly shared it with his shitty friends and one of them probably tee top or por leaked it just for the laughs stupid jin you were the last nail in nons coffin
non probably will go apeshit and end up murdered by the bs or taking his own life in the forest
poor phee he and non actually were the real victims of all this shit phee telling non to get lost and die were probably his last words and it took a toll on him and its probably the reason of the revenge
at this time i want phee killing all of them in the forest nobody of these trash deserve to live


does anyone know how old non is suppose to be please i mean is he 18 because otherwise keng is being awfully calm consider that someone filmed him have sx with an underage student


hes in his last year of high school so most likely around 1415 and age of consent in thailand is 15 which still doesnt excuse what keng did tbh

i finally was able to see the last two episodes and omg so much stuff is going on
as some of you mentioned already i am not sure that jin is the one who released the video he didnt press the button and the computer crashed because of the beer and not the keyboard getting pressured to post the video and it may be one of the other a since apparently the video has been saved on the cloud i am not justifying the fact he took the video that was an a move of his part but hes heartbroken and he saw that non was with a guys in clearly a romantic way  i dont think he saw phee face so for him i think the logic is non  cheater and liar i need to confront him or something
poor phee he deserves so much love for how supportive he is
speaking of phee and non yes non is so much in his mess that he will do anything to get out  that explain the teacher thing but  it is a controversial idea  it seems that he used to have a certain behavior according to phee and is under a load of medication so maybeand again it is a controversial idea it is not the first time he cheated on phee i doubt that or he used to have more than 1 fwb also hes still lying to phee not about the money but about the movie too the scene when he talked to phee about continuing filming even though they were bullying him make me think that he may have a bit of a feeling for jin and that what make phee worried about also maybe non have some emotional issues  go back to the pills ill say depression and a kind of imprintment disorder or im totally wrong and just overanalyse everything



waah im mindblown tbh i was getting bored with the show in the beginning no offense to the actors but it was full of unnecessary jumpscares and bloodi was not feeling itit felt slow
but entrance of non changed this show and wow boc really did good job hiring barcode he really is so talented im impressed with his acting out of those frnds i only can forgive fluke that med student with glasses he was a silent bystander which is a bad thing still he didnt directly hurt non yet so i think he needs to be exempted
others all can got to hell even that tee guy screw him i know ur fathers health matters and hes stuck with his uncle still he really messed up nons life terribly just bcoz ur miserable doesnt mean u can drag ppl to hell nd nxt week preview seems like hell help his uncle to kill non
and non i might sound like a sadist  but i support him hes spiralling like crazy in next ep and is about to diebut im curioushe lost phee and is all alone i know the tutor will ness up everything so with no support no wonder he goes crazy
now pheehis cop father is involved too i know its going to end badly
jin too like waah hes the wolf in sheeps clothing screw him idc abt pheejin now eventho phee forgives jin etc etc whatever ill never forgive him for what he did to non its horrible to be viewed when doing stuff nd sharing in twitter disgusting
and  i always thought jj was hot in kinnporsche  nd hes still hot aaaaaahhh boc will survive if they continue making unique shows and also if they dont let go of the writer especially writer sammon she wrote triage ofc i know shes talented love her
i cant imagine how a teen like non will handle all this shit i pity him poor soul
waah love this series  it has all the elements i like waah im enjoying itthey gave tabarcode jjbarcodestill against grooming tho   but barcode really is that hidden card in the series


these flashback episodes have been so heartbreaking i was literally bawling at the end of the last one but they are also an absolute masterclass at constructing a persons downward spiral and it would be completely understandable if non did snap and is the killer or if he killed himself tbh if the latter did happen though my heart would break for phee he probably blames himself the most for not being able to protect the guy he loved and telling non to go and die probably haunts him
also in present day it has got to be phee and tan in this revenge plot together i remember jin having mentioned that they were particularly close even to the point that jin thought they were sleeping together too if tan was the brother  new  it would make complete sense that they infiltrated this friend group together white though i feel like he may have been a victim of bullying in the past it would be a huge conflict with tee once all his previous actions get revealed and maybe help tee realize the gravity of his actions not a redemption because lets be honest he doesnt deserve one but an interesting arc for sure


originally posted this on the wrong ep but i figured it out
i honestly wondered if boc would be saving barcodes first onscreen kiss for jeff in wuju bakery but lord
that young man got some this week
like i genuinely gasped at the sneaky kiss and then my brain me l t e d with what followed
so so so proud of barcode and ta this week acting was incredible


awww how i wish non and phee will be together again cus they were cute together


jin didnt do well even he wanted phee he could have done it in a nice way than taking that video of them so he was the cus of the break up but no matter what he did when phee took jin to the river side you guys remember what he said to jin he will never forget nonoh man i just had a terrible thought  when a gangster says i had them work off their debt and they are pretty and young i really hope that uncle joe didnt sell non off into sex trafficking


oh my gosh thats a possibility


amazing acting by barcode in this ep when his dad slapped him i felt it in my bones however ep7 remains my most fav ep thus far bc of how much emotional turmoil it brought
my thoughts for ep8
jin have not redeemed himself imo this ep a bunch of stop calling non greasy or feeling guilty about the leaked video isnt enough to absolve him you know your friends is shit but just let tee and top carry non away and lied to the police if you have enough guilt and seen the person you love so distraught youll care for him till the end
i know everyone is happy mr keng is implied to be hit by the car and died but imo it was too quick and not enough he dies thinking himself a hero  a good guy who try to solve crime and helped a poor boy he deserves worse
i think the redshirt guy at the cinema is white not tan reason 1 tan was immediately shown in the preview so why cut himoff to create suspense 2 the exposed forehead haircut is closer to whites style than tan 3 in the bts photos when white was in school uniform his pants are blue same as phees school
side note por is shit but the person who deserves torture and death the most is tee por did a lot of mental bullying but tee is downright criminal i know hes powerless under his uncles instruction but choosing non as his victim was all on him


he just trusted his friends with non how could he even believe that nothing would happen to non and then lie to the police i cant forgive him at all


i really like tee as a character he is a true villain and at the same time he is trapped by his circumstances so really no way out for him


true i know i said i wish him the worst of torture and death but hes honestly my fav character out of the 5 bullies whereas por top and fluke feels a bit 2d tee is interesting bc for all of the bullying that he did we get to see the other side of it the pushing factor the writing for tee is great bc he did unforgivable villainy stuffs while still gaining some sympathy points from audience compared to like top for example whos just shown to be mean for the sake of being mean


ooof non breaking down and completely giving up was a hard watch barcode the actor u are
the teaser for next week clearly show that tan and phee have plotted together so excited to see them interacting with the group now this show keeps getting better and better



bocs cinematography
man these people are such fucking pieces of shit even how fluke is just like i didnt do anything like bitch you still just stood back and let everything happen same with jin like sure getting them to say nons name just erases everything i do like how the group is seeing that they are just as expendable to por as non was
tee you are in way over your head what did you think that your evil gangster uncle was just going to send non out to the teenage boy farm so he could live happy and free range with all the other poor young kids
barcode acted the fuck out of his descent you could feel how he was just pushed to his breaking point like a physical weight on your chest
man i started tearing up at the pheenon flashback goddammit especially it cutting off at phee telling non to just get lost and die
so jin seeing kengs ghost doesnt bode well for non ten and phee not being able to see the ghost stuff makes sense if they were working together but where does white fit into this he was seeing himself with boils all over him which has nothing to do with anything else and how does the cult really fit into it did non curse them as he died
i need it to be saturday again im so fucking obsessed with this show
edit right now jin and tee are my fave characters they have done garbage things but there are a lot of layers there


i thought they killed him when he went a bit psycho and them going to the police and acting like because of the sex tape they didnt want him around them while filming the movie i was later confused when tee was acting brand new with uncle about status of teacher and non so i had to rewind lol


still group didnt do anything that warrant killing except tee for targeting non  jin for recording

lets put our societal hats on for a sec none of them have probably done anything that really warrants it jin has defended non multiple times and in this episode we can clearly see that tee doesnt want non to die even by horror rules i find it difficult to clearly label many of them with the exception of maybe top and por

omg those first 10 min were hard to watch and then we got to the snap and boy barcode is nailing every aspect of this frenzy color me surprised tee gave the uncle nons money the audacity of this gang i hate tee with a vengeance and i hope white is gonna kick his ass in the future if non doesnt get to him first tees words non is with mr keng he must be happy when he knows he gave non to his uncle its ominous vecause we knoe keng is dead so no good oitcome for non and thats on tee the way they all lied to the police about non  the way por took credit for the script
but nothing hurt as much as those flashbacks with phee  i knew his last words to non would come back to haunt him ooh tan is on phees side maybe white will be too how many more eps do we have left i cant wait for next saturday


i just dont understand why non ever thought hed get credit for the writing when he has been treated like shit the entire time those boys were never giving him credit ever poor kiddo


maybe just like jin said he thought he would gain value in their eyes over time after all his work was golden and they said it they just never attributed the gold to him in their smooth brains


cause of death the heart killers 
he understood that too late but he did have the receipts about sending the script so on that regard he knew he could fight that


i assume that the file details encoded will show nons name if thats what his computer settings were and assuming he used a word program or whatever program on his computer would have those details of course thats in our world irl idk if the writer of the series is using dff world building details and our irl programs encoding stuff doesnt exist in dff world lol


cause of death the heart killers 
i tbink sammon tries to keep things realistic im more and more positive this is not gonna be a ghost story


i am so pumped so ready guys
tonight our special snowflake breaks the mold and will bare his fangs
the drama will continue
oh who am i kidding i am not ready


ok guuuuuuys the acting was sooo good i still need to pull myself together after that episode


have you guys clocked that non took a picture of the apple he shared with phee and has it on his desk  and also kept the flowers phee gifted him  if anyone ever truly doubted it they were both so in love 
the effort put into keeping all these characters multidimensional and the actors really deliver even the pieces of shit have their moments of humanity like damn no weak link in that group
the rhythm of the episode is perfect not too quick never boring it is really impressive i will be able to rewatch it all without cherry picking
and i had barely recovered from pheenon and they give us the flashback with new footage 
i have so many theories are multiple will conflicting  like is a severely damaged by the mafia non trying to get revenge while tan and phee are still investigating his disappearance will he see phee with the fucker group as one more betrayal  it is even non i actually hope so i want him back did he see phee and jin and is out for them because of their bond 
what i would like to see 
tee sacrificing himself for white yes please i want him human to the end and it would be so fitting
non to be back and shenanigans with phee and jin whichever they are and whichever couple ends up happy if there even is a happy couple maybe he kills them all for real


i didnt clock that was it when he was rewriting the script im loving these small details this really is a good series that more people need to jump on board with
to your end point
maybe phee has to kill non im just sayin im just sayin i need my  to survive this mess


730 just before he breaks the group picture
yeah maybe  to protect jin such drama i am so ready i want drama but i also want love i dont really know what i want i just love that show so much


im going to guess that white is probably connected to keng if tan does turn out to be new i bet white will be kengs younger brother
what a hard watch this episode was por is crazy for not stop filming when top was getting stabbed by non just shows how hed do anything to get his film done hes so slimy
tee such a complex and interesting character like i love to hate you  he is a victim in his own way but imo he is worse than por pretending not to know what his uncle is capable of to try to lesson his guilt i cant imagine when white finds out the truth
jin  i cant hate him because of his beautiful face ughh but doing nothing is just as bad as doing something 
now i wonder  phee clearly approached jin so he could get into the group but did he end up catching feelings for him as we see him protecting jin in the present


well you see we have opposite feelings for tee and jin also it would have been so easy to make tee just a bad guy but he really worries about what happened to non asks multiple persons and probably harrows guilt about that yes he did not care about him even hated him yes he used him in the scheme but at the end of it death is never what he wished on purpose boy

yeah we have to remember he is just a teen in a difficult position he cant go against his uncle and his father is sick so he needs money deep down he knows he signed nons death but he is powerless to do anything about it

i was just saying to a friend that the way people are reacting to jin is really frustrating for me because to me hes the least wrong in the friend group but weirdly is getting the most hate


i dont hate him but he is complex i neither stan him nor think he is the worst but thats the good thing  they are all greyscale and some are muddier than others
a lot of people are using black and white they choose a viewpoint mainly non but sometimes also phee and judge every other character according to that thats how non gets hate for cheating on phee and phee for not being empathetic with non or jin for taking the video but there is so much more to all of them

yeah the lack of nuance in fan reactionsperception has been bugging me for awhile its clear to me that the writers have deliberately added depth to each character but its being overlooked or ignored by some


im definitely guilty of this but i am admittedly an og minor family loyalistapologist so im certain that any character tabible play ill fall hopelessly in love with pick their viewpoint and defend it till the end  the  carries over from series to series


hahahaha well ta actually won my heart for real this time but i just keep collecting favourites at that point he still managed to steal fourth spot in front of bible in my list
but yeah in this specific drama i try to be careful to not stan too much i am in a anything can happen mind



ill admit i was harsh with jin in my review post i definitely dont hate jin its just that his lack of actioncourage when it was needed is what hurts the most because jin is the closest to non in the group
its like when non lied to phee about the kiss with the teacher it hurts the most bc phee is the closest to non period
on the bright side i think jin will redeem himself in some way by the end and the pheejin to come softens the blow at least for me cause im looking forward to the complexity it presents i could definitely see them finding a comfort and solace in each other but they just dont know their grieving over the same thing phee doesnt know that jin was the closest to non but hell come to learn maybe


i think a lot of people see him as farcical he wants to hold up his righteousness but hasnt done anything to actively help non or even stop the bullying he pulled non back into the vicious cycle when he was ready to leave this group behind i dont hate him per say but i honestly dont think he is much different from his friend group
a lot of people probably see that duplicity as more malicious too because even non gives him the benefit of doubt and thinks jin is on his side but is he really does he actually care beyond his own self interest of having a crush on this guy again like all the characters he is complex

bocs cinematography
tee is honestly my fave character hes shit but there are layers to unpack there with the others aside from jin in that core shithead group what you see is what you get but tee and jin have a lot of layers

ohhh hurray someone else who likes tee ive been defending him from the beginning haha and its been very lonesome hes done horrible things but i understand him


count me in too  third favourite character for me really like the layers and the performance


bocs cinematography
i just find him a really interesting villain hes far more nuanced than someone like por i mean i love to hate por too and im glad that bitch is dead hahaha

hes my fave too the chance is small but i actually hope he survives so he has the opportunity to get away from his shit family even if it means going to prison or something similar as an ending


i cant hate jin too hes so pretty i keep getting distracted i mean the only bad thing he did was record non  keng and probably someone else uploaded it idk i love him too much

barcode the actor you are
thats it 


barcode gutted me this episode yet again really selling the misery and then the descent these flashback eps have been brutal just watching all these men preying on non in every way emotionally monetarily sexually etc there was an analysis i read too that stuck with me  everyone romanticallysexually interested in non thinks theyre going to be the one to save him and gets annoyed when theyre not  and i love how it all come to a head this ep really hope hes still alive
found it wild that the netizen comments that non read mirror some of the irl discussions about nonkeng ive seen online so that was especially heartbreaking to see reflected in nons breakdown like that amazing foresight from the writers and goes to show how nuanced theyve purposely been making these toxic interpersonal relationships
idk how im ever supposed to forgive jin tbh lol i really hope phee destroys him at this point even his last minute defense of non to the friends pissed me off it just feels so hollow when we also know he continues to be these peoples friends in college and lie for them plus the revenge porn filming was just cruel love jins character so much and im glad hes there his role is so so interesting but i do hope he dies hahaha
now tee logically i know he should die too i know i know but he has hot tall meow meow privilege in my head so im still rooting for a satisfying redemption somehow some way idk hes probably gonna die and deserve it lmao but ill miss his handsome face also his actor is definitely the strongest imo of the newcomers
another great episode its so engaging and i am absolutely loving this series

this was the first time they mentioned that non has a sibling new i wonder if white or tan is is nons brother trying to see whats good or out for revengeance 
also this show has such funnysharp really good characterspecificdefining dialogue like this is such a fluke thing to say lmao

new was mentioned previously in episode 5 theres been a lot of speculation as to whether hes in the show or not

oooh ok t4p


im glad i stuck with the series long enough for it to get to the non backstory i was not into the first episodes because im a horror fan so the horrorslasher stuff was not giving ill be honest but both the boys from kp are hard carrying for me barcode impressed me so much ta is giving me exactly what i need from him also very impressedthe backstory with all the evil stuff they did to him has been very good hard to watch because of how horrible what happened is but that section hooked me i just hope that the return to the slasher revenge stuff holds up because it was not very good at the beginning but im invested in the plot now so that will definitely help just no more slow menacing walk ups while the boys scream and stumble awkwardly if they can make the revenge attacks feel tense and fast it could redeem the whole first part for me

what an episode i have never watched a horror that im left rooting for the masked killers before who is tan brother maybe is non alive would they really kill off the tragic protagonist was the film a hint at jin being the one to survive but then what did white do is he in on it every week im left with more questions but each episode is getting soooo good


bocs cinematography
phees smash brothers sarcastic clap is everything



im a certified fan of barcode now wow he was a kid crying and a loving brother in kinnporsche but him as non his expressions when he was going crazy wow hes so freaking talented i really like his characterin the series hes the life to the series i said what i said wow pond really did a great job recruiting him im impressed his micro expressions were not awkward i can feel his emotions he knows the correct angles and what makes him stand out like i didnt feel anything off with his acting and jj too is nailing it jj us and barcode are my favs here like they really can acti was so into kp once so maybe im biased i guess i also like others too
tacopper flukeglasses guy tee top and tan are good too wicked gang is perfect  i also dont know who tan is like i thought he was nons brother but hes abroad nd a college student so  idkunless he dropped out bcoz of lack of funds or wants revenge on his frnds bcoz their family fell aparti cant think of anyone else who was close to nonand i also like pheeta like he got cheated still he seeks justice for non  like he got moralsim also sick of jin acting so pure i guess someone else uploaded the video bcoz laptop turned off and he was drunk etc bcoz pheejin are like leads so theyll detoxify jin i guess still id only give fluke the pass he was bystander and selfish tho but atleast he did not hurt non directly
i cant wait to see whats yet to unfold  i really love this series they really spiced up the show a lot
also special mention nons parents fighting was so realisticive been there lol like i felt nons painand barcode really impressed me in that scene



best episode yet i was hooked from start to finish this show has gotten sooo good
non  theres nothing else i can say about barcode hes everything  i cheered when he got a piece of top with the knife but where the fuck is he i dont care about keng
phee  lfg sir lfg get to the bottom of it and make em all pay  him slow clapping in the theater i loved it i think he was eyeing jin specifically so hes found his way in i think soooo here we go
the quick recap of the of episode 7 and the last 10mins really confirmed for me that i need a tabarcode series of their own something about barcodes explosiveness and tas quiet subtlety that would be amazing i wonder howd they do at comedy
the shitheads  i to hate these assholes tees still my favorite i really like jjs face cause of his storyline hes complex with his uncle who is the key to nons whereabouts flukes the effects team me me and me line had me giggle por is trash and im here for it cause i love us who doesnt top i can takeleave probably hes my least favorite
jin  oh how far youve fallen  i was rooting for you you really are spineless and its gonna eat you alive at this point i hope phee is playing you in the present and hes the better actor and he doesnt even act
edit i dont hate jin he clearly cares for non im just disappointed which is always worse  but ive got a feeling hell redeem himself so 
finally tan but is he the brother 999 sure he is but  but please dont tell me white is just an innocent bystander in all this and just hooks up with tee i really want my tanpheewhite schemingrevenge trio
but now that i think about it im ok with him just being the innocent bystander he was just there for a good time
hi there perth 


i saw on tumblr something about schrdingers non and i am both crying and laughing
the way my jaw was on the floor for 98 of this episode mom and dad fighting really got to me so many adults failed non at so many levels and its shown a lot this time and jin not admitting his own faults out loud and fluke saying hes not part of it the fuck
also i have a question and im on mobile and spoiler tags havent been working for me so spoiler of a question was that tan in the theater i tried pausing and couldnt tell im assuming yes because of the teaser but idk and we saw perth maybe he becomes a bigger player as time goes


it looks like mio so yeah i would say it is tan but i have been looking through the crowd for that red shirt and found it nowhere so they were not seating together with phee who is clearly seen on a lot of scenes in the theatre


update friend  iqiyi posted on xitter asking and pinging fuaiz and mio if they knew who is that person the eyes dont look like fuaiz imo so it has to be mio what is interesting is that he was not here with phee but randomly so who is he really and what was he doing there


cause of death the heart killers 
does look like it


non has the most tragic life in all of bl history it was horrible at least if hes dead hes finally at peace 
finally we saw perth i wonder who is he tees cousin dd


in my villain era
weve all been waiting for it and here we are non coming ungluedhonestly i think they could have leaned into it harder flowers to barcode though he is doing the absolute most in this series
plot heavy episode no warningstime stamps are needed
they teased non writing about the deaths but im thinking its a red herring and as the preview is implying phi is out for revenge uncovering the truth
love that everyone has ulterior motives and trash people


cause of death the heart killers 
yep everyone seems to have their own agenda and i pray white is on team phee 


in my villain era
so i was thinking what if phee is playing the long game here hes intentionally trying to lure jin in because he found out what he did and is waiting for his chance to get revenge
i think non being the killer is too obvious what if its nons brother helping phee
this all conjecture is based on the aggressive amount of horror i watch


cause of death the heart killers 
im trying to think like sammon here i dont think this is gonna end up being a ghost story ive assumed new was older than non do we have confirmation of that or its just something we all thought because he didnt live with his parents what if new is younger than non and as you say hes helping phee what if new is white


i am starting to think we have three forces here that are not working together and will collide 
phee and tan which are best friends and tan has been recruited by phee to help him find what happened to his precious lover
white who is new the brother i cant see him knowing phee i mean we dont see any kind of attempt at communication between new and non right  even at his bottom  or worse tan or he knows phee from what he found in nons desk but cant be sure of his implications also appeared out of thin air after parents decide to invest money into looking for non if new is white he is tech savvy and can find everything he needs in nons computer to trace troubles back either to phee or to pors group
finally non because as long as i dont have a body i will believe out there with his crutch trying to get revenge for himself has he been helped by perth or simply paid his debt after three years will he be disfigured i even wondered if they have like sewn together his lips so that he never talks or has he been freed when uncle went to prison but was unrecognisable
i am pretty sure they dont work together which explains the messiness


bocs cinematography
i also wonder if perth will have a bigger role to play where non is involved hes acting as joes masseuse when we see him but he could also be doing more sex trafficking and slavery is totally a thing with gangsters so if non is paying off his debt they could run into each other


cause of death the heart killers 
but phee and jin were spared when they hid in the coffin maybe that wasnt luck but intentional if pgee doesnt know that jin was the one posting the vid he would try to spare him top taking the spear off seems to me like he got drugged or maybe he is just salty about pors behavior during the premiere of the movie he was always saying he was pretty convincing as his character and everyone was dismissing him now who killed the uncle top so he could get the setting he wanted fir his own revenge


i dont know if phee and jin were willingly spared knowing that people analysed that it was probably not top under the mask because the clothes do not match except if its a production blunder but for the moment i would like to think it unlikely
so who is under the mask  tan phee and jin and every other boy apart from top are accounted for at that point but masked man had black shoes and top has white shoes so non 
and then wouldnt it be an artefact of non not wanting to kill phee he let go of jin and phee and goes for tee instead but why tan  maybe he does not recognise him or take him for por i really dont know
top clearly look out of his mind be it drugged or just so frayed at the edges that he looses it specifically his overall attack seemingly seizure and his denouncing of tees actions
was the uncle a mistake  or a fake or just something we are sorely lacking context for for me non can be crazed enough to just kill because it is useful uncle dent had to die as the one who brings food and drives the car maybe
i am so lost but trying to find what makes sense and nothing properly connects which is perfect because i both dont want to be able to plan what is going to happen but i dont want them to subvert expectations at all cost like some other occidental show did which destroyed their coherency
in my villain era
what if new is white
this omg that would be a fire plot twist we dont have an age confirmation just that hes the golden child son and not in the home they could be the same ageholy shit huntress what if theyre twins


oh my god thats literally what i wanted someone to say so badly also we literally saw how smart white is with the walkie talkies and everything so maybe thats bc he studied abroad ugh i never needed i theory to come true so bad

like fraternal twins that dont look alike or related that would be a big twist


in my villain era
you could do either i was thinking new turns out to be an identical twin and the killer working with phi


new being nons identical twin would probably drive everyone insane lol


cause of death the heart killers 
omfg youre saying white is new who is nons fraternal twin i need to lay doen for a bit im getting dizzy and everything 


in my villain era
lets call up sammon and tell her we got some thoughts about this


cause of death the heart killers 
we definitely do 


barcodes performance is so so good that these 4 episodes have been literally a torture for me non is gone and after how those motherf killed keng he probably had the same fate
por proves he has no soul in his body even recording when non attacked top for real but glad the others felt like non were they realized they were just expendable like non was
i dont feel any pity for nons parents they are probably the main reason non ended with a very low self esteem everyday compating with his perfect brother and then the stupid father slapping him my blood boiled so now you cry well fk you if you had supported your son maybe he should have ended in that mess
tee may be the most evil gay ive ever seen in a series lol he got rid of non selling him to his uncle and the he ask if he is fine sure boy a potential witness will be okay after being with a mob boss fking hypocrite it seems that white will just a bystander but i would have loved if he is in phees plan to make him fall
jin oh god jin what have you done you mess it big time you hindered an investigation and nons ghost will be following you for these 3 years you still defend non but when you had to do just just covered for them im so intrigued of how his relationship with phee will develop and why in the present timeline phee and tan are sympathetic to jin maybe they know something about jin we dont
phee and his eyes filled with regret for non and hate against the group are evrything tan and him are going to make their lives a living hell by the way can we say an is nons brother new he has been very smart in the present episodes and his and top disappearing and top coming back crazy is probably his doing
by the way in the present timeline that sleazy tees uncle is dead considering this series i doubt this is just a coincidence who do you think he kills him phee tan maybe nons parents


everyone must die not a single person spared 


another great episode i was so indifferent about this show up til ep 4 and now it consumes my thoughts every saturday morning boc cant keep getting away with these addicting shows
they gave us more pheenon flashback crumbs and i ate them up non having his mental breakdown and going between sad cryexcitementcrazy cryback to sad cry was heart breaking but wow kudos to barcode for acting through all those emotions in one scene
keng being hit by a car is the most stereotypical asian drama way to off someone lol seems like hes officially dead then though now i wonder why theyre being vague about non 
por is absolutely a piece of shit for using footage of the stabbing and taking credit for nons work but damn us looked so good during the premiere thank you stylists 
and look im still not thrilled by jin in this episode i realize tensions were high during the stabbing scene but its just so vague to admit to you were the one who hurt non the most and apologize but not tell him why and when hes being interviewed he lies about non being missing idk man maybe hell do something really big to redeem himself but as of this episode hes not my favorite copper was really glowing and handsome in his scenes though
im sooooo ready to see phee and tan infiltrate the group next episode and get the gears moving for whatever they end up plotting or if they plot at all  it could be that their only motivation for joining the group was to find out what happened to non rather than get revenge and therefore what ends up happening at the cabin is all due to actual ghostscult activity rather than a murder plot orchestrated by pheetannon



profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
oooft okay thoughts on ep 8 first barcode  what an actor honestly has portrayed non so so well por top tee fluke and jin  cowards bullies all round horrible people phee  i love you so much and your dad is a dilf  im so excited for next week tan asking all the right questions straight off the bat we love to see it revenge begins now


i just need clarification on the timeline
the stuff with non happens 3 years ago 5 years ago and then when do they jump forward to like when do tanphee join the group it just seems like months later
and then how long is it before we jump to the present time in the woods


in my villain era
i think its a year epsiode 1 when they were headed back to the cabin it was to party before they headed off to uni it is sort of nebulous though

am i they only person that noticed that non changed the whole script to make it more violent and gruesome for all the boy but jin survived i think that non made jin survive put of everyone because hes the only one he couldnt imagine killing i wonder if that point will come up later in the series when we get back to the present day i also wonder if jin was the one who posted the tape what would happen if nonmaybe ghost non found out about that

im 5050 on whether this show is going to have an amazingly compelling rich and intriguing ending or whether its going to be rather stock horror lol with what theyve given us so far im hoping desperately for the former but also steeling myself for the latter
first thing i want to get off my chest i remain an ardent and adamant jin defender its funny because at the beginning i was kind of like eh he comes across as kind of bratty i dont know what i think about him but as time has gone on and weve found out more  oh i really adore this character and the depth theyve given him
some of the fandom debate going on about his character is actually quite frustrating because i feel like its so black and white and ignores some of the things staring us in the face jin is the only one we see defending non over and over again including in situations where there is no benefit to him he defends non even when non is not around nullifying the to make him look good to non argument and catches flack for it from them nullifying the he wants to look good to his friends argument
is he perfect of course not hes an incredibly flawed character who has acted selfishly and made mistakes but imo hes the most redeemable of them all even when non is gone and jin has no idea whats happened to him and hes seen that his friends are capable of drugging someone yes he lies to the police  lots of people do when theyre scared shitless especially when they know that there are four other people who will say that theyre the ones lying
which leads me into the ongoing debate raging in the fandom as to whether or not this is a story of pure revenge or something more and i stand by what ive thought since the end of ep 6  im going to be so disappointed if this turns out to be a stock cliche revenge horror story revenge is like one of the most basic horror tropes and while it can be very satisfying to me it would not be the satisfying or compelling ending here
instead id like to see the show lean into the parallels that i can see here jin and phee both wanted to help non and failed both of them hurt him im not debating which one hurt him more lol and likely carry a lot of guilt over it that makes for some incredible potential if the two of them can find solace and comfort in each other also imagine phee got close to jin to find out information or maybe even with some revenge or justice in mind and then started catching feelings imagine the guilt and conflict that would make come up in him what about jin whenif he realizes who phee is
the potential is there in swathes and if the writers ignore it to go lol revenge im going to be so so disappointed i also feel like theres a lot in the narrative pointing towards it not being the case but thats another matter
questions
we saw more of perth but does he have more significance
who was talking to keng and what happened to their investigation
are non and keng still alive

i partially agree with you i can understand jin he wants to help but he doesnt know how hes in love and feels betrayed a conflict between heart and brain however one thing bothers me i trust that it wasnt him who leaked the video but the fact that he thought of filming it really bothered me 
i also want to see the relationship between phee and jin but if the series is to end like their movie with only one survivor i hope phee will be the survivor and i hope jin will learn the whole truth about pheenon before he dies if they decide to kill him 
for the questions i hope non is dead it would be better for the series but on the other hand i hope he and keng are alive for full revenge  keng was talking to the woman who was spying on the restaurant weve seen her in an episode before 


keng stuff confuses me like is he undercover police or newspaper or a cult lol

bocs cinematography
im with you on jin he has done extremely shitty things and some of the care for non has been performative but not all his feelings are genuine hes flawed but thats what makes him a good character its the same way i love and want to strangle tee his uncle was right in that hes a coward but to me there is more like jin has more whereas characters like por and top are just rotten top is absolutely a hired goon that sees himself as the main character and por is a rich piece of shit who will stomp over anyone who gets in his way of what he wants and fluke is totally spineless and thinks if he turns his head nothing happened


rwrb ofc bmftms
with three weeks late and without having seen more than ep 8 there is something that does not seem curious how is it possible for jin to see a bloody keng if no one knows his whereabouts since that scene i have thought that jin was involved in kengs death could he have been the one who ran him over in a fit of jealousy


i understand your point id view i love that jin is a complex character however for me his betrayal runs deeper than any one else its very difficult to forgive jin because his actuon had direct effect on nons life and for me he did all the bad things in disguise of being a good guy and loving non

stock horror with that kind of story its original and incredibly exciting i dont get what more couldve this show been

when i say stock horror what i mean is a stock trope thats used quite often in horror and as a motive
character has a secret connection to the victim in the past and is now here to kill everyone for revenge is pretty standard for horror slashers in particular often have this as a motivation for the killer
theres also the fact that from the very instant phee appeared on screen with non the entire fandom exploded with omg phee is here for revenge to kill them all  another reason its a stock concept its predictable and theres nothing particularly surprising about it
now can the surrounding storyline still be interesting and compelling sure but i wont find it nearly as fascinating as if they buck those fandom expectations surprise us and present something else entirely to resolve the plot



interesting i wonder how they could avoid the tropes but still have the ending satisfying in some way what would be interesting to you
its not original at all but i cant resist a revenge story like i fell in love with the count of monte cristo when i was a teenager its my perfect storyim typing on my phone so i cant italicize book title or i dont know how
before this episode i still had hope jin would still survive till the end but now i fully believe hell get killed
even though hes remorseful i think hes too far gone with the bully group to not be killed alongside them none of those 5 will survive
that leaves phee tan and white if they will follow the slasher trope with only one surviving final girl will definitely be phee while the other two will be casualties from the chaos

i just want jin to know all the truth before he dies i want him to know that phee loved non before and all stuff 
i kinda feel like phee fell in love with jin so lets see the endgame 

omg for some reason i went into this thinking it was the final episode so glad there is more phee and tan are gonna investigate i wonder when white comes in


i really hope white will come in next episode bc we all thought the backstory would be over by episode 8 but its clearly not haha maybe we get teewhite backstory cuz chronologically it would make sense if it happened at similar times as phee and tan getting introduced to the friendz


i have two running theories for white
hes new nons brother and comes back from abroad to investigate because his parents cant afford a lawyer he then finds tan and phee and works with them on the investigation and during it meets tee and either falls for him or takes advantage
very far fetched hes dating tan and decides to help with their investigation by getting with tee
umm either way i think white is affiliated in some way with phee and tan because they were really close at the house and i think being super close with ur friends young boyfriend is kinda weird idk
i hope everyone dies  im just unsure about the logistics with non being the killer 


every single one of them especially jins spineless self 


still believe non is alivetee drugged him thats why he went psycho on them tee and top disposed his bodymaybe they just threw him in the woods or down the river somewhere but he survivedphee is on a revenge fact finding missionta i think is older brother newbarcode


yeah but the issue is that the uncle said that te brought non to him so this doesnt work


you need to pay attention to what you watch the uncle got non 

this series is just so damn good  ill be honest i wasnt sure about it after watching the teasers but decided to follow along weekly and its just getting better and better usually i can work out a few things that might happen but up until this point i had no idea what was gonna happen the twist with phee and the tutor with non completely surprised me
barcode what a development hes made watching the first few minutes was heartbreaking but he completely sold it i see where phee and tan are coming into it from the teaser next week i wonder how white comes into the friendship group
what are your thoughts


considering they already revealed to us that tan transferred to the school with phee do we think it could be white calling out to phee in the movie theatre i couldnt see their face clearly so it would be a fun twist if white was in on it tooi shouldnt be laughing but omg white  i have no idea how he could be involved in this but i sure hope he has good reasons to be caught up in the revenge scheme otherwise imagine if he really just wanted to hang out with his boyfriend  he signed up for a nice little getaway with his lover and instead everyones just losing their minds and dying

that would be so fucking hilarious in a gallows humor way if that were true but i just cant think that sammon would leave this one character without the same levels of grey and nuance as every other character also there is that line that still sticks out to me as weird from the first episode where tee says that white promised he would be obedient if he came to the cabin like huh we know that tees a bastard hes still my fave character though but he doesnt seem controlling of white he melts to whatever white says and seems more jealous when other boys touch him
one thing ive wondered is that joe said non paid off his debt in gangster world we know that usually means prostitution perths character could also be a sex worker forced or not that comes into contact with non maybe white is similar



during the allout brawl when top was beating the crap out of tee whites face shifted from petrified to something like happiness for a couple seconds however in the next shot hes back to looking scared again since the cult doesnt seem to be a factor in the show so far its looking less likely that white could be part of the cult and more likely that hes connected to the mafia i wonder if he genuinely cares about tee at all or if hes at the house to enact vengeance on someone elses behalf like tees uncle with the revelations about phee and tan we know that every character except white in the house has their own agenda and secrets theyre hiding from somebody else
im super curious about whites identity at this point given that 23 of the new friends are infiltrators with ulterior motives if phees goal is to gather information and tannews is to instill fear and confusion to force a confession what could be driving white in the first episode its mentioned 3 times that he really wants to recreate the movie and implores tee to go along with phee and news suggestion since tan the biochemistry major is drugging them and inducing hallucinations is white the computer engineering major responsible for cutting the phone lines and tampering with the walkie talkies theres a couple instances where they seem to be closer than expected in episode 3 tan says he heard something and white tells him to have some water tan replies that he heard something for real as if he was trying to communicate with white when theyre looking for the hard drive he suggests that he and white go explore a room he found under the stairs and at one point he grabs whites hand as they run out of the room white tannew and non are also the only characters in the shows poster who arent splattered with blood although he does have a few specks on his face the implications of his name make his identity even more interesting in western literature the color white symbolizes purity and innocence but also serenity light and the allknowing truth and the flip side to white is black which is what the masked killer wears so many questions


white also had his worst fear revealed as std the blisters so i think he might maybe be a prostitute that tee met that way or he is on drugs i think he has some connection to the mob and thats how he met tee
and the uncle idk if that was a collective hallucination or something else but if hes dead for real then hes the true victim in all of this


the one on the scooter right with the drug in play it is possible that was a hallucination they will take the sheet off the body and find out there is nothing underneath


its possible that the uncle drove all the boys including non to the house and lied to the police afterwards so the killers would have a reason to target him



i have been rewatching episode 1 now that we know what we knowwhite is definitely in on it with phee and tan
they nod to each other in the first 10 mins of the show when phee puts on the film that they made
just the way the original ones nod to each other before the video is played not sure how they are linked but he is not there by chance in my opinion 
plus he is also keen for them to remake  continue the previous film he is vocal about that with tan  phee oh i cannot take the twists and turns
maybe white has a family member who got caught up in tees uncles business that could be the link

when he smacked his ass i fell i always knew he had it in him look who his brother is


ass worshipappreciation runs in the whole family and im thankful

definitely thankful

bocs cinematography
hahaha yeah i was kinda hoping that when he was taking jins pants down that he would dive in like that particular move with vegas and pete

same or i thought it phee would put jin on top of him you know


a minor family spinoff is what i need in my life come on boc make it happen

cause of death the heart killers 
im still reeling from that nc scene omfg that was good
but this comment is about the story and boy did we get some answers so tan is new which is great casting because he kinda looks like non  ive believed for a while now that this wasnt about ghosts but some other twisted story and im glad this is the route sammon took we have answers about the things they have been experiencing and im here for it
i wanna hug tan tbh because hes been through a lot but that smile at the end ugh the quiet part was the drug wont kill them but i sure hope they do themselves  this is a villain i can get behind
i still believe were missing a piece of the puzzle and that piece is white im not buying hes just a sweet bystander 
can i get more obsessed with ta i dont think i can but im willing to be proven wrong 

the part about hoping they do that was the vibe i was getting too tannew i also saw coming but im still living for it white was wearing the same uniform as phees before he went undercover so im assuming white must know phee in some capacity unless hes just an innocent bystander but given the plot doesnt make sense
also ta being double cheeked up is not what i expected but that was one of the better nc scenes ive seen recently granted im super new to bl so maybe theres better idk 

ive watched pretty much every nc scene ever made in bl even scenes from shows i havent watched im a nc sceneconnoisseur and it was definitely one of the better ones the only problem i had was the camera moving awayaround too much


cause of death the heart killers 
that camera shaking they have sometimes i dont know if they wanna give the vibe of found footage to this part too are we being inceptioned a film within a film within a film comment image


cause of death the heart killers 
ta was not afraid of success and i thank the bl gods for it boc seems to deliver in the cheek department and im here for it

that part ta saw how bible mile and apo did scenes and took notes 


he take after his brother bible 

another person commented here saying it must run in the family 

in my villain era
im hoping for an 11th hour twist with my final girl white
the twist in todays episode makes me think of the movie shrooms and it explains quite a bit but it felt like it telegraphed the rest of the series really hope they have more in store sammon though can be hit and miss


cause of death the heart killers 
ive enjoyed manner of death and triage what else does she have under her sleeve


in my villain era
i hated the mod novel loved the series though transplant the sequel novel was way better then the original
triage novel was better but the series was better
i am excited for spare me your mercy its by far her best book and track record shows the adaptation will be even better i have high hopes

bocs cinematography
i think there still might be something supernatural going on or its not all just newtan remember the first time they went to the mansion to film por saw something behind the shrine when he was filming and it vanished this was long before any drugs came into play and non was still very much around


cause of death the heart killers 
im mostly basing my theory on sammon usually not going the supernatural route well see how this goes although i believe new wont survive this and he wont mind he has nothing left 


bocs cinematography
oh absolutely  he was already ready to die when phee found him i think this is his own extended suicide but hes taking everyone else with him


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant fault him though 


bocs cinematography
no me neither i cant say what id do in that situation i have a really bad temper so it would probably be something similar hes in scorched earth mode because there is nothing left for him he gave up his real schooling in england his parents sold their home so he has no real home anymore both parents are dead and non is either dead or missing he has no future and no hope and nothing to cling to other than revenge


cause of death the heart killers 
this was really his villain origin story 

if there is an actual curse aspect its on nons family at this point but i agree that newtan is a sinking ship and he has no intention on leaving anyone behind


i stand by phee ta what the hell was that do it again please
on a sadder note poor newtan also i think phee fell for jin but for the sake of the whole revenge plan had to push him away


do it fcking again phee ta out did his character to the tea



bocs cinematography
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh another fucking week of losing my mind with theories
 it was in the back of my mind that it was a drug induced haze so if newtans drug induces their worst fears and secrets whats up with white seeing boils all over himself
 fuck i feel so bad for new he lost everything all he has his is cold cold revenge to wrap himself in at night hes become a batman villain plotting his revenge in his chemistry lab
 we still know nothing about white we see him briefly and hes already tees boyfriend but how did they meet he goes to a different school was it a dating app like how phee and non met still so many questions there and there was that one weird moment when they were filming the redo of the movie where phee held whites hand and they had a moment was it just because of oh thats tees boyfriend and tee is very jealous but then phee purposely had jin caressing white for the take knowing it would make tee hit the roof
 what if theres more to whats going on with jin we see that while he took the video there is definite probable evidence that he didnt leak it since his laptop shorted out so non betrays him then he develops feelings for someone else and phee rejects him honestly the pain in jins eyes when phee shut him down was such good acting on coppers part you could see his heart breaking what if hes like fuck all these people for forgetting about non and fuck phee and tan for going behind my back is what he thinks since hes convinced that phee and tan were screwing
 keng still alive in the preview for next week we see what could be him hes wearing the watch with joe and his goons but it could also be perths character since hes also got the blondish hair and when we see the hands holding up the mask its a similar shirt cuff to the shirt that keng is wearing
 i think that theres definitely more than one revenge plot going on here and there still might be supernatural things happening  when they went the first time to the mansion for filming por saw the masked figure hiding behind the shrine when he filmed it and there was no drugs in play there and non was still around so there was no reason for revenge on anyones part other than non
 wow that was an nc scene ass slaps and blow jobs and thrusting and nudity and everything and phee definitely caught feelings for jin and then seeing the article about nons disappearance made him realize that he really was cheating on non and it wasnt just fucking him for info the part at the lake where phee was describing non was so sad
edit also watching that nc scene again for research purposes of course of course they were framed in the window  not only was it just a cool shot cinematically but what if someone saw them

the boils thing i wonder if thats whites worst fear maybe an sti ive always wondered if hes involved with the mafia as a prostitute and thats when he meets non  in the preview next week we see non and the teacher on the rooftop with the mafia wearing the same clothes as the photo on the news article about them running away on a bus together which leads me to think they are both still alive you could be right about keng


bocs cinematography
i also was wondering for that path for white perths character has yet to be shown more and i think hes in the same path when joe said nons working off his debt we know what that means when a mafioso type says that  forced prostitution and that would kind of align with how jealous tee is of other guys touching white and how he said if you came you said youd be obedient

there was a scene when tee went to visit the mafia guys and there was a young looking boy with the men ive wondered about white since then i get the feeling phee or tan didnt plan the trap in the woods for por or any killing i think tan wanted to drug them for confessions and its icing on the cake that they are attacking each other so theres one or two masked people running around and weve already seen if given a weapon non will use it plus the ideas are straight out of his script we dont know much about keng why was he trying to get into the mafia casino is he the one capable of beheading poor scooter guy cant wait for next week

saturdays have become the day where i spend hours refreshing my iqiyi app so i can watch dff as soon as its available and wow todays was so much tan being new wasnt a surprise per se but given how many questions weve had about him this whole time we got some answers
white is still a mystery he seems to be an innocent bystander but he had on the same uniform as phee did before switching schools and my thought is he potentially knew phee beforehand in some capacity otherwise hes just being traumatized wanting to spend time on vacation with his partner which really sucks 
i also have to give copper his due credit we knew ta would serve its not his first rodeo as far as being in a series but wow he and copper served as soon as that first slap connected i knew this was serious ta being cheeked up twice in one series was not what i expected tbh jins reaction to ta makes so much sense now
this show is working my brain overtime and i have more thoughts but ill leave it at this is one of my favorite shows period so far and i hope the momentum keeps up

hi me again still working this episodeshow through my brain i wanted to mention the writing of the show here because i see so many parallels between character interactions and my mind goes to generational trauma and how that gets passed on and i see a lot of that written in a way thats realistic and that isnt shy about looking at how each characters own histories influence the cycles of traumapain being inflicted which makes some of the decisions made make sense even if they arent the best however you might want to define it some bls ive seen im new to them so my experience here is limited lol are very surface level which isnt necessarily a bad thing but i just really appreciate the depth given to dff i might be rambling here but yeah wow this show its a good one


this might be super crazy but what if white is phees brother honestly a lot of things arent totally adding up in my head but i just believe so badly that phee and white have some connections
i dont believe white is just colateral top was beating the shit out of tee and white took his sweet time to help his boyfriend lol  you could say that he was terrified but he legit waited like he wanted to punish tee lol  oh maybe its all in my head  we have yet to see


bocs cinematography
considering how all the other characters are i just cant see sammon not giving white some more nuance and grey and layers since every other character has it there is the definite desire to freeze in traumatic situations but sometimes he seems very calm and other times hes freezing up or being generally clumsy maybe purposefully i think there is definitely more to the story there


i noticed that too phee said he was unsure that theyll make it out so it seemed like their plan had gone out of control somehow tans plan involved hallucinogens only rather than murder unless he had planned further without phees knowledge i think phee and tan arent the only ones plotting revenge

omgg i was literally yelling at my phone white stood there for 3 to 5 business days

i went back to that altercation and you are absolutely right there was a brief moment where whites expression didnt look frozen but more exhilarated somehow he had a bit of a grin on his face as tee was getting pummeled and then went into frozen and then moved to help him white as more than final girl and the one who actually was punishing them would be interesting and we know sammon loves her crazy twists stuff that is completely off the radar
didnt expect tannew to be just as unhinged as non but both of their parents are dead so i guess it makes sense  phee does have feelings for jin so i wonder whats gonna happen when they find out the truth about everything the pheejin nc scene was hot


considering the mother it does seem like mental illness runs in the family so not surprised that newtan leans towards that as well

wow this was a muchneeded episode us viewers finally get confirmation on a lot of theories and speculations built up over the last few episodes
nons family is alltheway tragic i know a lot of the responsibility falls on the parents for how they turned out but adding variables such as their socioeconomic status the corrupt justice system societys poor regard for mental health its hard not to feely pity towards this family watching the mom was just so heartbreaking
finally we get to know tan after him being missing from all of act 2 im surprised to see that hes a more important character than i initially thought the biggest question mark we have now is white and i hope that hell be more than just a boyfriend that gets accidentally caught in a crossfire of revenge
i wonder what phee and tans end game is after the bullies expose themselves then what it definitely feels like theres a bigger fish to fry than just the bully crew somethings going on thats beyond the revenge duos control im so curious


bocs cinematography
yeah i also feel there is something else going on besides just what phee and tan have going on i also feel that newtan is on another level of revenge than phee wants hes got nothing left and is doing an extended suicide phee asked if the drug would hurt them and newtan assured phee it wouldnt  but im not so sure and i wonder if phee also has things going on that hes not telling tan the whole thing with tees uncle and his death still has to be answered
we got a lot of questions answered but i feel like those questions brought up more questions god i love this show
well phee definitely took his role of becoming jins friend to get information seriously even tried to slap the information out of him
seriously though im loving all of your theories 100 there is more to white and i cant wait to find out what phee clearly likes jin but had to support tan and his villainous plan that lab though lol i think its amazing how well they kept tan in the background until now ahh this show is so good

listen phee i dont care if you fall in love with jin were sticking to the plan so i dont want to see your heart flinch jin is one of the bullies remember  


that nc scene took me by surprise in the best way possible that was amazing i guess getting some answers was nice too but the 



im sorry but tans evil scientist lab with evil green lighting is kinda funny in the campy way
i need answers about white immediately he is too suspicious since phee told jin that he wasnt sure if theyd make it out alive either him and tans plan mustve gone out of control andor there must be some other plan in motion that he wasnt aware of
its pretty clear that tan had dragged top to the cult building and drugged him but are his hallucinogens able to mindcontrol top to become the masked murderer and kill por that seems implausible and i think there are other factors at play
and we still dont know who caused pors knife marks por being led to get stabbed by the branch and the uncle who was beheaded question is did tan do it im certain that he was involved somehow but whether he involved in all of it or if there was another party is another question
this episode delivered so muuuch im happy
first of all this episode finally answered something for me what set all of this off weve known since early on that the events in the past were quite some time ago which always left me wondering why the time gap and why phee and whoever else before today acted now
we finally got the answer to that question at the end of this episode with the reveal about non and news parents in news eyes he has nothing left at this point and hes riddled with guilt and rage even in the past he was clearly driven by both but theyll be even worse now that hes also lost both his parents i can only imagine the sense of responsibility that weighs on him because with each and every one of them theres a theme  hes not there
which begs the question what has he been doing for the past two years he didnt go back to his normal life that much is clear from his conversation with his father but he also hasnt been around in the preview for the next episode it shows a figure mixing something seemingly surrounded by the same hangings weve seen around the cult stuff  did new get drawn into the cult
now lets go to the other major arc in this episode  phee  jin
as soon as the cast started asking is pheejin real last night it confirmed for me that phee had been in it mostly for info so i wasnt really surprised
however i am deliciously pleasantly surprised by what this episode delivered in terms of pheejin crumbs
first of all its clear that phees actions are driven by a desire for information rather than revenge i know that some people have speculated that having sex with jin was a revenge tactic but i have to ask  revenge for what at this point all he knows is that non was involved with the group before they disappeared and that they stole his script would he really go to the lengths of deliberately seducing someone based on that
now thats not to say that doing it for information only is much better but theres still a key difference there one is designed to get close and find out more the other is designed to hurt and everything that phee did in this episode seems geared more towards the first rather than the latter
im also not convinced that phee actually had sex with jin for information only because  having told new that hes slept with jin to get closer and to get information  what does he do does he use that tactic to spend more time with jin perhaps try to go out on dates with teewhite or the rest of the group to exploit his connection try to ask jin questions about non
nope instead he promptly pulls away fast and hard  and that tells me that maybe the sex wasnt about information at all  or that he realizes that he cant keep staying that close to jin without getting in over his head his actions simply do not jive with someone who is trying to use having sex with jin for information or revenge keep in mind that he simply does not know enough at this stage to match a im going to break jins heart goal
now as to whats going on in the present  we see a few other things we see phee trying to call jin and my first thought was oh this will be when he suggests that they get together  because that would track with phees professed goal of using jin for information but that didnt happen jin didnt answer but also  por is the one who suggests the trip not only that but we then see phee trying to see jin in person and then in the scenes out at the cabin we see him seemingly getting really worried when jin starts hallucinating
now theres a small chance that phee is going to use this to try and get information from jin  i wouldnt really blame him tbh but with his overall behaviour etc i think its clear that phee is more conflicted than hed like to be about jin
other thoughts and observations
at the end of the episode we see a preview and at the very end of it we see two things non and someone else probably keng lying down and then a shot of tee  and guess what tees clothes are the ones that he wore during the interrogation scene in the last episode which is after the boys had gone back to town and people realized that non had disappeared we only learned just last week that tee was directly involved in nons disappearance in the first place but now were learning something else on top of that  he saw non after all the other boys did to our knowledge he may be the only other person who has
its hilarious that phee ends up going to school in jins uniform which has his name on it like can you imagine hahaha thats how tan knows that he slept with jin
i think thats it for now but im sat and hoping that this show continues to go the direction i think it might because weve got all the crumbs brewing for a delicious conflict
oh and also  im still soooo curious about white because we didnt even see his backstory yet whats the deal with our innocent boy and when are we going to find out about perth

cause of death the heart killers 
when i heard that first spanking sound i was deadly wounded then we got phees butt front and centered and it was the coup de grace

the spank was personal and i was shook
i am screaming tas naked little cute booty i am traumatically shook

wow ta is so hot that was one of the best nc scenes ive seen in a minute as far as the actors performance goes


yep undie free with buns included cant beat that p

im shook right now that was so good ta is incredible i hope he gets more lead roles in bl


two wordsthe spanking 


cause of death the heart killers 
so good rivs so fing good

pakin girlie 
woooooof 


cause of death the heart killers 
i was howling alright
2940 start there
the way i was screaming and hitting my pillow it was unbelievable  10000000010


gonna get this out of the way and say i want more nc scenes with ta my god i actually think i had an out of body experience when he slapped jins ass not once but twice and then gave us a whole shot of his backside  that man is serving in every damn episode phee is also so so boyfriend material the way he takes care of people nonjinnew ughhhhh i guess im a ta stan now  
now for plot stuff  i think we all knew new tans connection with the group so the reveal didnt seem surprising though i will say im impressed by how new portrays himself as tan vs how he actually is  definitely two different personalities
im curious if the pheejin romance is gonna follow the trope of i initially pursued you for ulterior motives but then caught feelings and now i must push you away but well eventually come back to each other and somehow overcome the reveal that jin was the recorder of the video even if he didnt leak it 
nons parentsomg what tragic situation for this whole family  newtan losing his whole family in 3 years and he still couldnt find anything about non
so it looks like drugs were the reason that drove the events at the cabin and not actual paranormal stuff  i had a feeling that was the case but does this mean tan also orchestrated the uncles beheading and pors impaling as well those were pretty gruesome and its hard to believe he would go that far with his plans
preview for next week looks so intense how many eps do we have left im not ready for this to be over 

considering both his parents killed themselves i think tan did orchestrated uncle and pors death he has nothing left to lose no reason to live other than vengeance and he might as well plan to kill himself after all is done i think he planned some things on his own without phee knowing


bocs cinematography
this he is absolutely in scorched earth mode hes going down and taking them all with him unlike phee hes on a oneway journey

hoeing for boeing
i cant i just cant i need to know the ending but i also need the messy ride


man this gets extra hot then extra dark but at least now we kind of know whats going on  
more importantly is his butt always that big and i just never noticed or is it just the angle thats the real mystery


bocs cinematography
i think weve only scratched the surface of whats going on this show makes you feel like now you know everything but you really know nothing

this show is so good 

this show is so fucking good 


taphee is the hottest thing on earth no wonder jin saw him the first time and immediately had a crush on him


this might be the show im most excited about to end so i can binge i almost always watch shows as they air but i also cant handle horror and unpredictable endings so i gotta wait on this one
but you tell me theres spanking now too oooooof im so ready

total ho for supanuts smile
anyone else feel like they need an emotional support groupanimalhug after this its not just me right
this show is dragging us through the ringer emotions wise i went into this expecting a horror show and what its delivering is so far beyond just a simple horror show


bocs cinematography
i saw on twitter something i completely forgot about jin was calling non during nons suicide attempt where phee came to rescue him what happened there they never went back to it

they also didnt show what happened to phee and non during that convo so im not sure if its going to become relevant or whether they just overlooked itcut it

yeah i was disappointed that episode 7 didnt pick up right where epi 6 left off like jin was heading towards the house and phee was already there with non also they never talked about nons suicide attempt either nothing thats frustrating for me


i am so thrilled ta came thru  i saw his potential way back when and he lived up to it woah  and copper is stunning and also did amazing
two epic  bl scenes back to back weekends

im totally saving that post and i definitely saved a bunch of photos

in my villain era
so as i expected the plan was to investigate what happened to non tan being new was a good little surprise i was thinking it was a possibility when he was introduced last week
theyve finally clarified the timeframe bigger gap then id thought that two year jump was a big one certainly took a dark turn at the end of the episode
i wish we hadnt got the big exposition dump though sort of took the fun of speculation out it it dose sort of remind me of the movie shrooms solid irish horror film
ta is single handedly pulling off what entirety of playboyy cannot
trigger warning   suicide
516  jump scare

profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
just came here to say i rewatched the soccer scene a few times thank you tee for being shirtless 


omg cuz same ugh why does tee have to be so terrible and yet so fine tt like white pls share but also tee give me white i can protect him while you pay for being an ahole

ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
im assuming most people noticed this but when tan asks phee if hes cheating on non phee is wearing jins shirt
one thing that really irks me is that in episode 1 tan and phee ask about the short film as if theyve never heard of it and one of them says that they never finished it obviously they did finish it and even showed it to people and phee and tan mention it to them multiple times in this episode
i definitely dont think that phee was fully aware of everything that tannew is planning for the cabin do we know who brought the gun up still curious to see what happened that got the uncle decapitated unless he somehow faked that to add to everyones paranoia and fear
now that we know so much more about all the backstory i want to go back and rewatch the first few episodes with all the new context and see what ive missed also now that i can actually tell the characters apart
also currently on team non and keng are still alive



this show is bonkers and im ok with that i was waiting on this episode most besides nons arrival of course ill go down the list
likes
phee  im in  with his character but i love ta so im biased but phee is less intense about the revenge than i thought hed be like hes so calm and level headed about this he seems to be trying to assess the situation as a whole and not jump to conclusions he should be a cop like his dad
pheejin  i wasnt prepared  but theyre  i just wish the scene was shot more from the side i wanted to see more of coppers body plus i wanted to get a good look at their kisses too also i got the impression that was their only time together and it ended just as soon as it began if so thats  this probably went on for awhile i just wish i knew how long the scene at the river idk lake was really lovely calm and warm i loved how phee described non to jin 
tan  mio was  he said oh yall wanna see me get ready surprised in the best way possible this poor family has carried so much sadness and heartbreak its like they were cursed or something mental health issues run in the family so id be losing my marbles too hes the one whos really out for blood the scene with himnon was  i dig how direct he is with the questions he doesnt beat around the bush whatsoever
white  im convinced hes an innocent bystander whos there for a good time not a long time  but hes definitely the final girl hes smart but just scared to death bc duh plus i think its perths character who was behind the door at the police station and hes investigating the horse account otherwise white could be pulling a 21 jump street
the quick exchange between toptan about the test you didnt study dumbass 
dislikes
the show subverts my predictionsexpectations but im not completely satisfied its like the episodes are a meal im getting the calories and there is flavor but its not enough so im not fully satisfied
so am i to believe that phee gives the game away to jin bc he feels guilty about the drugs is that how this goes down show huh thats not satisfying for me
i just really wanted a reveal either by accident or intentional to the whole group all at once i wanted all the shock that comes with it i wanted anger drama  tears yelling fighting i wanted por to know the truth before he died cause he was an awful person i guess we may still get a scene like that but 
i just wanted all of these asshats to know that non has people who love him they werent there when it counted which is eating them up inside but if the group thought this was put behind them it never was i wanted that flavor more than anything for this show
real world talk they all deserve prison time and non would go to a mental health facility he did try to kill these guys
unfortunately pheetan would get the worst of it if the drugs are the cause they inadvertently caused por to die cause he was drugged now the uncle is another story bc who set up the damn wire cutter was it top tan
i really dont think theres a supernatural element at all going on here its all smoke and mirrors and theyre hallucinating all this stuff

each week i am amazed
since episode 5 we are in a rollercoaster that gives everything we have answers and new mysteries things connect like a jigsaw some things we anticipate and some we dont it is so good gastronomic serie
new is tan is good we were all still wondering so much mio can finally shine and honestly for someone who did not want to act who just wanted to be like jeff satur and do music that boy served they all do but i am so happy with his part
the family drama is terrible the tiny things accumulating  forgetting about your siblings because your own struggles are more important comparing your children wanting the best for them and being absent in the process these four people loved each other as families well except from non to new because new never invested in their relationship and also probably jaleousy the parents fighting but loving each other so much the many regrets the mothers regret in berating non the fathers regret in hitting non news regret in being too absent first from nons life but then he does the same to his parents the fathers regret to have doted on new forgetting non in the process all this to end up with new not being worth it not really but i am voicing his feelings and non gone true tragedy and we all feel like it will not end well for new will non actually be the last one standing yes i am in denial my boy will come back
also the realisation that tan and phee know nothing they know there are two scripts and that one the last one found in his room is from non they know non had sex with the teacher and they are vaguely aware of the horse accounts everything else we know they dont no wonder they at least phee are still testing water
phee is such a lovely boy rightful warm also horny  ta is doing so well i hope he gets some recognition for his work here and i am not only talking about the nc which was incredibly hot no wonder they joke about their intimacy he deserves to rise in the rank at boc they dont have ranks but you know what i mean
i am looking forward to phees emotional journey because he is at a tipping point wouldnt it be terrible for non to come back now that phee seems to have decided to go for jin spurred by his future departure  yes 2 years ago phee was still in love but what of now
the mystery around white thickens so he arrived in between and we see him already being lovey dovey with tee so their thing is long term bumps mv revealed a lot of their future scene so following flashback will concentrate on teewhite i am so pumped
also the preview  whose voice is screaming about non will phee and jin die for each other or is jin truly the final girl like in the movie will their relationship overcome all the revelations coming is perth protecting non or just idk i need to know more about that scene


newtan thats right get dem ollike pokemoni guess top got the smokes with the xhe was most delulu and violentphee has developed feelings for jinlooking forward to the next eps


omg ta  i still see baby macau and i cant  anyways
thats complete nonsense with the cigarettes and antidotes anyways ill buy it xd
i love how the plot works and how we keep switching time like i love it im not even mad like its tense in all times so yeah xd
im way too invested ha 

is tacopper the mini mileapo because that was hoooot ta is hot fine fcking ass respectfully 

im late to the post but damn this series keeps surprising me and i have no clue what to expect next
i expected phee to try and get close to jin but i didnt expect him to take him to his spot he took non and then did that with him all of a sudden when he took him home  bruh
also totally called tan being nons bro their whole family was so fcked up and sad ugh now i can see why everything is the way it is
i suspected some supernatural shenanigans likeit cant all just be new using the hallucinations to trick everyone bc por died the same way non wrote it in his script 


i will be so mad if non and keng are both alive together it just ruins everything

im wicked late to this show and only just caught up but have to scream into the void somehow bc holy shit i did not expect this show to hit this hard i have no organization really to my thoughts at this point so im just gonna spew my random brain farts into the ether bc i need to release them somehow
first thought is barcode now ive never been shy about my distaste for his character and disappointment in his performance in kp i think porchay should have had more bite and agency and i stand by my opinion that barcode was too young and inexperienced for the role at the time however whatever hes done in the meantime whatever workshops boc put him through fuckin worked bc wow is he blowing me away and in my defense even when i was wishing theyd casted someone else and written porchay differently i always knew barcode was a good kid and hoped he got as much opportunity as he wanted to work on better projects and in healthier sets away from the disgusting groomer kp writers im so so glad that he got to do this and actually flex those acting muscles hes been quietly building since kp non is a wildly complicated character who goes through sooo many changes yet barcode is making him so believable and grounded despite the hysterics and crazy scenarios
second revelation was ta macau was a pretty minor part of kp he only had a few scenes and beyond some thirsting after fans caught on that hes packin a wicked body i dont think hed really gotten any chance to shine i certainly hadnt thought much of him since kp well thats a serious oversight cus wow is he also acting his tight little ass off in this show too he doesnt get to hit the sort of extremes that barcode or mio do but hes got me believing all of phees motivations and reactions which is what matters i do think he has mastered chemistry w his bl partners a little more than his overall acting but his romantic relationships are the center of our attention for his character so thats actually a smart thing to focus on if he can truly make me believe that he adored non which he does and is genuinely conflicted about getting close to jin for dishonest reasons which again im buying that fully then im less fussed about whether his got exactly the right reaction or line delivery in other scenes
weve only really had 1 ep of properly getting to know him but mio is also killing it so far as tannew i kind of had a feeling that tan would secretly be tied to non somehow from pretty early on and i had phees connection spoiled by twitter before i even started binging to catch up so as soon as they mentioned that non had a brother studying abroad i kind of knew it had to be tan but still i do really like how they revealed it and ye gods does my heart break for him when he loses both parents and is overcome by guilt feeling like hes the real cause of all of his familys deaths
although i wish wed gotten more of news decent into drugs and revenge it just seemed like an abrupt leap from him frolicking w the bully gang surreptitiously trying to get them to spill about non to suddenly being 23 years later and hes gone all walter white was he already studying chemistry where did this idea of drugging them into admitting the truth even come from what drove him to that extreme for that matter as tightly plotted as the rest of the show has been his whole plan w phee seems very flimsy how would he even get registered for school wout his parents knowing how did he avoid them seeing him for like 3 whole years when they thought he was abroad but really in the same city wouldnt the school have recognized him or did he go to a different high school than non did none of the others in the bully gang get suspicious that he never talks about his family or invites them home but they have skipped around quite a bit to reveal things out of order so perhaps well get more info on how this all came together later maybe he got the idea from one of nons stories or nons favorite old horror movie
the other loose end im hoping well get an answer to soon is wee baby white he just pops up randomly as tees boyfriend which sidenote regardless of how awful they all are its oddly heartwarming to see that not one of them has a drop of homophobia on display and unquestioningly accepts when one of them starts dating a boy kind of a fun reversal of the homophobic bully trope wearing a different uniform so clearly he never went to their school it doesnt make sense for him to have absolutely no connection to the main plot but again he never went to school w them so its not very likely that he knew non but i was thinking maybe he did know keng what if he went to school w phee before he transferred and maybe they were casual friends or acquaintances so he knew phee had a boyfriend and even saw a picture of them together he could have been groomed and raped bc minors cannot consent so it is always rape by keng in the past so when he saw the news about keng running off w non he went to phee to explain how predatory keng was so that phee wont blame non anymore and white decides to join the revengetruth plan bc he thinks keng might have been the one to disappear non so he needs the truth to be sure that keng wont come back for him when hes done w non or just for closure if keng is really dead or i could be overthinking it and hes really a follower of that suicide cult who stumbled into the jackpot of easy sacrifices lol

quick thoughts on the rest of the castcharacters i fucking hate top and i really dont like jets performance as him hes really the only purely awful character and i cant stand anyone who only communicates in screamshouts thought im sure jet is a lovely guy irl i just wish someone had taught him how to deliver a line without flailing i actually empathized w por a lot more before we got the backstory even tho he didnt do nearly as much to directly harm non as tee and top have the whole boo hoo my dad might smack me around a bit and i have so much pressure as the son of a politician really isnt working on me as an empathy tactic bc my eat the rich mentality is too strong lol fluke im kinda torn on i kinda feel like we dont know him well enough to buy his whole present day meltdown at the cabin but i also cant entirely hate him bc he did have kind of the least to do w nons downfall though much like jin theres an argument to be made for a silent spectator being worse than an actual assailant he knows for sure that top broke the camera and tee agreed to help cover it up so he has to have put the pieces together of what tee put non through yet he said nothing bc he is so stuck on that upward social mobility that being a doctor could get him that he wont do anything that might rock the boat and jin oh you poor lovesick idiot im not really sure why he even stays friends with the bully gang all its a bit odd that he repeatedly chooses them over non yet claims to be so in love w non that hes devastated by seeing him w another boy and enraged enough to post revenge porn when he finds non being raped by a teacher which would be child pornography technically and yet i do buy that he genuinely falls for nons awkward charms and creative mind just as much as he falls for phees chivalrous kindness and devastating dick coppers chemistry w both ta and barcode is undeniable in the end jin is just a dumb teenager in love who follows his emotions but like fluke is too afraid to rock the boat when it comes to his social circle tee has to be the most complex of the bunch even tho admittedly i dont think jjays performance usually reflects that hes clearly trapped in a really awful situation but choosing non of all people to drag down to hell just to save his own ass is a special kind of awful he seems to be so ready to throw non under the bus yet clearly feels guilty later and also appears to be totally whipped for white
oh and maybe someone can answer this question why is non even bullied in the first place where did the nickname greasy come from he doesnt look greasy at all nor does he really have any other qualities that would normally get a kid bullied did they specify somewhere and i just wasnt paying close enough attention or maybe thats info well get later i do remember when phee was asking non to be his boyfriend he mentioned that non had a lot of tough times in the past and hes obviously taking some sort of medication for depression or something perhaps he had a public mental health crisis a breakdown at school that caused the other students to ostracize him bc of the stigma around mental health issues or his weird emo stories got leaked to the school and he was branded a weirdo
overall its wild how theyve managed to weave a complex but mostly understandable web with even more complex characters even keng who only has a handful of scenes but occupies a big presence in the current part of the mystery as a paradoxical predatory rapist and freelance crime investigator though do we know if he was grooming non as part of his plan to expose the gambling ring or was that an unplanned manifestation of his worst urges the technical aspects arent always ideal you can definitely tell that they did not have a kp level budget for this and i still think a lot of the actors needed more time to mature before taking on these roles but damn the story is hitting all the notes the pacing is perfect even the time jumps back and forth are surprisingly easy to follow as long as youre patient theres still time to fuck up the landing of course though tbh i kind of dont care how it ends despite all my questions and it being such a mysteryfocused show im much more invested in the characters and the experiences of watching it all unfold so i dont think ill mind however it resolves or leaves unresolved everything
