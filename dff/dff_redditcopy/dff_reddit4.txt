Horror tropes were tropeing but I liked it. Fluke is so paranoid and had a full psychotic break. He’s dead meat soon. 

It seems like Non may have been killed as a sacrifice by his friends to grant their wishes. They said something about that in the beginning.

For half a second I was feeling for him, when he was explaining about the video and the impact on his career but then he went back to being stupid and threatening baby White and I just can't have it.

Man, the episodes feel so short. I am ENGROSSED.

- Who is Mr. Keng??? Was that body bag of dry leaves an effigy of him?

- Fluke you fucking moron. There is always that one horror trope character that isn't the killer, but it so selfish and paranoid that they just ruin everything for everyone else.

- White and Phee best boys. Poor White was so scared. I love that Phee is the calm one, but still caring about Jin. I want to know their backstory. And even though there is something off with Tee, I actually really like him as a character. I can't wait to see his backstory more. And him immediately throwing himself in front of White to shield him - I said it last week, and I'll say it again that Tee and White have such a good casual intimacy about them.

We don't know - I'm sure he's done some shit, but maybe White's not as innocent as he seems.

I'm gonna say that he was freaking out at the time and when he got his senses back he went back for him. Bit I'm starting to feel like no one would be enough for our precious baby White.

I'm so fascinated with this show and really like how it's keeping me guessing as to whether there's supernatural involvement or not. Like even now I'm still a bit sus as to just what's going on.

Can't wait for the flashback scenes to come!! I want to know what went down, I want to see Jin and Phee's past in particular because I have no idea what happened between them. I want to know what Tee did and whether he deserves my baby White!

I haven't had a chance to watch yet (I can't wait though - I'm fucking LOVING this show), but one thing that is sticking in the back of my mind is from the first episode where Tee said to White 'You promised to be obedient if you came' or something along those lines. Either Tee is mad controlling or possessive, or there's something more to White that we haven't seen yet, because it's not like White is a terror who is flirting with everyone and is hard to control - so unless Tee is a complete bastard (which he may be), it just struck me as something odd to say.

Tee seems like an asshole so I’d bet on him being controlling and possessive.

I'm low key thinking Tee has a thing and he and Naut had a thing.

Hmmm, interesting. Tee is definitely not a squeaky clean character (I still like him though - I'm intrigued as to what his past is), so that would be interesting!

No sexy time this week, whole lot of horror tropes and screaming.

White continues to be my favorite character, and honestly the actor is the strongest so far. This whole episode was mainly Fluke having a meltdown and yelling. The standard sanity slippage trope, I would have honestly thought it would have been Tee and not Fluke, and I was surprised with the mask reveal not who I was thinking, well done. Poor Por, guys been dying for 4 episodes.

White calling out Fluke mid rant was actually fantastic 'shouldn't you use a clean needle and thread?'

Looks like next week we're finally going to find out what happened to Not

Timestamps

6:00 - jump scare 💀

14:00 - gory (sews up Por) 💀

27:40 - gory (Top pulls out the stick holding Por together) 💀

There are so many layers to that story…

Non…

Keng…

And all these past relationships we know nothing about !

Also yeah I just love Fuaiz. I also think JJay plays really well, his character is despicable but the good kind of despicable. Very egoistical and dark.

And we still don’t know what is real, what is hallucination, what is possession, what is just craziness.

Very interesting

I'm a little disappointed about the guilty party being a spirit or some kind of possesion. I hope they explain that Top was poisoned or drugged.

Fluke is probably innocent but so stupid and paranoid that he f****d everything telling the rescue team not to come to them.

Por is gone and Top probably too. Fluke is at the deep end and probably will be ended up soon by Tee or even by White, I still insist that he is no so innocent and weak as he seems.

We got just two scenes of Jin and Phee but were very cute. I wonder why they fell out.

Finally in the preview we watch what happened one year ago. Jin and Non seemed more than friends or at least jin was interested in him. I still say that Jin has something to do with everything.

I'm so invested in White's survival, I'm about to throw chanclas at my screen whenever Top/Fluke appear. And the jury is still out about Tee TBH.

Is there something wrong with me because I was bummed there were no spicy shenanigans happening inside that coffin??? Phi was cute to Jin though. He's getting those brownie points not to get bitten next time.

So excited for next week because we'll see what the whole thing was about but I will be missing White and Phi. Non looks cute though!!

Fluke really went down the spiral this episode and his paranoia and obsession with keeping his profile clean to protect his future prospects was so believable and relatable to me because i was damn paranoid and sensitive during my final year in uni too and it was stressful af to protect my grades and making sure everything was fine.

Top really upped the scary and creepy factor to me 🥲 I'm so damn happy I'm not alone tonight.💀

Also, them crying during THAT scene was just great acting because it looked natural to me who went into the drama not expecting to be amazed as most really didn't have any stellar works to look at.

SOMEONE PROTECT WHITE THE LITTLE BABY 😭

Barcode finally showing next week!! screaming 🔥✨ someone take off those sus hands away from him. I'm watching your every move Jin 🤨🙂

Why can't we get two episodes at least per week. I need answers and one ep isn't enough 🤧

when the masked villian removed his mask,.was that Top? or Non(Barcode) i couldn't tell🥸🥸🥸, oppsie it is Top, i looked at the shoes; so Top is part of a revenge plot conspiracy with whom? Non? at this point everyone is guilty and complicit in what they did to Non🧐🧐🧐

Comment Image
Fluke wanna be doctor was so unhinged, super paranoid, he is definitely.going cray cray, Por (r.i.p.)😩😩😩

Flashbacks with Barcode at last, looking forward for more horrific developments😎😎😎

The Masked Villian was Top. If you look back at the ground you'll see his white and black adidas and his white pants with the black line down the sides.

Also i'm super excited to see the flashbacks with Barcode to. I really wonder what happened.

I think Por had the Idea to use Jin against Non, so he could win the film contest. He wanted Non to write the script. So maybe the only way it would happen is if Jin convinced him to. That's my theory, but also I think maybe Jin started to get feelings for Non idk.

Another thing, I think the whole reason Tee and Top think Non is dead is because of what we saw when Top was having a seizure. Someone was going after Top (I think Non) and then Non on the ground. My other theory is that Non got to into the film and character and they got scared and hit him. After they hit him, it's possible he stopped breathing for bit so they thought he died. 

Maybe they left him there, that's why Fluke said to white "who would want to watch the video of a friend disappearing."

But right now I still don't know what to think.

With Top puking up sludge like that I assume he is/was possessed. I’m not sure if he’s been the masked murderer this whole time or just since last episode. Watching week to week, quite frankly I don’t remember when he got separated from the rest of the group 💀

i think there are two of them, like in Scream, last episode when tee and top were fleeing using the motorbike after that decapitation, the masked killer threw an ax at them that's why they fell and got separated🧐🧐🧐😎😎😎
