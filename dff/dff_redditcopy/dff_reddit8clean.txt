oh man i just had a terrible thought  when a gangster says i had them work off their debt and they are pretty and young i really hope that uncle joe didnt sell non off into sex trafficking


oh my gosh thats a possibility


amazing acting by barcode in this ep when his dad slapped him i felt it in my bones however ep7 remains my most fav ep thus far bc of how much emotional turmoil it brought
my thoughts for ep8
jin have not redeemed himself imo this ep a bunch of stop calling non greasy or feeling guilty about the leaked video isnt enough to absolve him you know your friends is shit but just let tee and top carry non away and lied to the police if you have enough guilt and seen the person you love so distraught youll care for him till the end
i know everyone is happy mr keng is implied to be hit by the car and died but imo it was too quick and not enough he dies thinking himself a hero  a good guy who try to solve crime and helped a poor boy he deserves worse
i think the redshirt guy at the cinema is white not tan reason 1 tan was immediately shown in the preview so why cut himoff to create suspense 2 the exposed forehead haircut is closer to whites style than tan 3 in the bts photos when white was in school uniform his pants are blue same as phees school
side note por is shit but the person who deserves torture and death the most is tee por did a lot of mental bullying but tee is downright criminal i know hes powerless under his uncles instruction but choosing non as his victim was all on him


he just trusted his friends with non how could he even believe that nothing would happen to non and then lie to the police i cant forgive him at all


i really like tee as a character he is a true villain and at the same time he is trapped by his circumstances so really no way out for him


true i know i said i wish him the worst of torture and death but hes honestly my fav character out of the 5 bullies whereas por top and fluke feels a bit 2d tee is interesting bc for all of the bullying that he did we get to see the other side of it the pushing factor the writing for tee is great bc he did unforgivable villainy stuffs while still gaining some sympathy points from audience compared to like top for example whos just shown to be mean for the sake of being mean


ooof non breaking down and completely giving up was a hard watch barcode the actor u are
the teaser for next week clearly show that tan and phee have plotted together so excited to see them interacting with the group now this show keeps getting better and better



bocs cinematography
man these people are such fucking pieces of shit even how fluke is just like i didnt do anything like bitch you still just stood back and let everything happen same with jin like sure getting them to say nons name just erases everything i do like how the group is seeing that they are just as expendable to por as non was
tee you are in way over your head what did you think that your evil gangster uncle was just going to send non out to the teenage boy farm so he could live happy and free range with all the other poor young kids
barcode acted the fuck out of his descent you could feel how he was just pushed to his breaking point like a physical weight on your chest
man i started tearing up at the pheenon flashback goddammit especially it cutting off at phee telling non to just get lost and die
so jin seeing kengs ghost doesnt bode well for non ten and phee not being able to see the ghost stuff makes sense if they were working together but where does white fit into this he was seeing himself with boils all over him which has nothing to do with anything else and how does the cult really fit into it did non curse them as he died
i need it to be saturday again im so fucking obsessed with this show
edit right now jin and tee are my fave characters they have done garbage things but there are a lot of layers there


i thought they killed him when he went a bit psycho and them going to the police and acting like because of the sex tape they didnt want him around them while filming the movie i was later confused when tee was acting brand new with uncle about status of teacher and non so i had to rewind lol


still group didnt do anything that warrant killing except tee for targeting non  jin for recording

lets put our societal hats on for a sec none of them have probably done anything that really warrants it jin has defended non multiple times and in this episode we can clearly see that tee doesnt want non to die even by horror rules i find it difficult to clearly label many of them with the exception of maybe top and por

cause of death the heart killers 
omg those first 10 min were hard to watch and then we got to the snap and boy barcode is nailing every aspect of this frenzy color me surprised tee gave the uncle nons money the audacity of this gang i hate tee with a vengeance and i hope white is gonna kick his ass in the future if non doesnt get to him first tees words non is with mr keng he must be happy when he knows he gave non to his uncle its ominous vecause we knoe keng is dead so no good oitcome for non and thats on tee the way they all lied to the police about non  the way por took credit for the script
but nothing hurt as much as those flashbacks with phee  i knew his last words to non would come back to haunt him ooh tan is on phees side maybe white will be too how many more eps do we have left i cant wait for next saturday


i just dont understand why non ever thought hed get credit for the writing when he has been treated like shit the entire time those boys were never giving him credit ever poor kiddo


maybe just like jin said he thought he would gain value in their eyes over time after all his work was golden and they said it they just never attributed the gold to him in their smooth brains


cause of death the heart killers 
he understood that too late but he did have the receipts about sending the script so on that regard he knew he could fight that


i assume that the file details encoded will show nons name if thats what his computer settings were and assuming he used a word program or whatever program on his computer would have those details of course thats in our world irl idk if the writer of the series is using dff world building details and our irl programs encoding stuff doesnt exist in dff world lol


cause of death the heart killers 
i tbink sammon tries to keep things realistic im more and more positive this is not gonna be a ghost story


i am so pumped so ready guys
tonight our special snowflake breaks the mold and will bare his fangs
the drama will continue
oh who am i kidding i am not ready


ok guuuuuuys the acting was sooo good i still need to pull myself together after that episode


have you guys clocked that non took a picture of the apple he shared with phee and has it on his desk  and also kept the flowers phee gifted him  if anyone ever truly doubted it they were both so in love 
the effort put into keeping all these characters multidimensional and the actors really deliver even the pieces of shit have their moments of humanity like damn no weak link in that group
the rhythm of the episode is perfect not too quick never boring it is really impressive i will be able to rewatch it all without cherry picking
and i had barely recovered from pheenon and they give us the flashback with new footage 
i have so many theories are multiple will conflicting  like is a severely damaged by the mafia non trying to get revenge while tan and phee are still investigating his disappearance will he see phee with the fucker group as one more betrayal  it is even non i actually hope so i want him back did he see phee and jin and is out for them because of their bond 
what i would like to see 
tee sacrificing himself for white yes please i want him human to the end and it would be so fitting
non to be back and shenanigans with phee and jin whichever they are and whichever couple ends up happy if there even is a happy couple maybe he kills them all for real


i didnt clock that was it when he was rewriting the script im loving these small details this really is a good series that more people need to jump on board with
to your end point
maybe phee has to kill non im just sayin im just sayin i need my  to survive this mess


730 just before he breaks the group picture
yeah maybe  to protect jin such drama i am so ready i want drama but i also want love i dont really know what i want i just love that show so much


im going to guess that white is probably connected to keng if tan does turn out to be new i bet white will be kengs younger brother
what a hard watch this episode was por is crazy for not stop filming when top was getting stabbed by non just shows how hed do anything to get his film done hes so slimy
tee such a complex and interesting character like i love to hate you  he is a victim in his own way but imo he is worse than por pretending not to know what his uncle is capable of to try to lesson his guilt i cant imagine when white finds out the truth
jin  i cant hate him because of his beautiful face ughh but doing nothing is just as bad as doing something 
now i wonder  phee clearly approached jin so he could get into the group but did he end up catching feelings for him as we see him protecting jin in the present


well you see we have opposite feelings for tee and jin also it would have been so easy to make tee just a bad guy but he really worries about what happened to non asks multiple persons and probably harrows guilt about that yes he did not care about him even hated him yes he used him in the scheme but at the end of it death is never what he wished on purpose boy

yeah we have to remember he is just a teen in a difficult position he cant go against his uncle and his father is sick so he needs money deep down he knows he signed nons death but he is powerless to do anything about it

i was just saying to a friend that the way people are reacting to jin is really frustrating for me because to me hes the least wrong in the friend group but weirdly is getting the most hate


i dont hate him but he is complex i neither stan him nor think he is the worst but thats the good thing  they are all greyscale and some are muddier than others
a lot of people are using black and white they choose a viewpoint mainly non but sometimes also phee and judge every other character according to that thats how non gets hate for cheating on phee and phee for not being empathetic with non or jin for taking the video but there is so much more to all of them

yeah the lack of nuance in fan reactionsperception has been bugging me for awhile its clear to me that the writers have deliberately added depth to each character but its being overlooked or ignored by some


im definitely guilty of this but i am admittedly an og minor family loyalistapologist so im certain that any character tabible play ill fall hopelessly in love with pick their viewpoint and defend it till the end  the  carries over from series to series


hahahaha well ta actually won my heart for real this time but i just keep collecting favourites at that point he still managed to steal fourth spot in front of bible in my list
but yeah in this specific drama i try to be careful to not stan too much i am in a anything can happen mind



ill admit i was harsh with jin in my review post i definitely dont hate jin its just that his lack of actioncourage when it was needed is what hurts the most because jin is the closest to non in the group
its like when non lied to phee about the kiss with the teacher it hurts the most bc phee is the closest to non period
on the bright side i think jin will redeem himself in some way by the end and the pheejin to come softens the blow at least for me cause im looking forward to the complexity it presents i could definitely see them finding a comfort and solace in each other but they just dont know their grieving over the same thing phee doesnt know that jin was the closest to non but hell come to learn maybe


i think a lot of people see him as farcical he wants to hold up his righteousness but hasnt done anything to actively help non or even stop the bullying he pulled non back into the vicious cycle when he was ready to leave this group behind i dont hate him per say but i honestly dont think he is much different from his friend group
a lot of people probably see that duplicity as more malicious too because even non gives him the benefit of doubt and thinks jin is on his side but is he really does he actually care beyond his own self interest of having a crush on this guy again like all the characters he is complex

bocs cinematography
tee is honestly my fave character hes shit but there are layers to unpack there with the others aside from jin in that core shithead group what you see is what you get but tee and jin have a lot of layers

ohhh hurray someone else who likes tee ive been defending him from the beginning haha and its been very lonesome hes done horrible things but i understand him


count me in too  third favourite character for me really like the layers and the performance


bocs cinematography
i just find him a really interesting villain hes far more nuanced than someone like por i mean i love to hate por too and im glad that bitch is dead hahaha

hes my fave too the chance is small but i actually hope he survives so he has the opportunity to get away from his shit family even if it means going to prison or something similar as an ending


i cant hate jin too hes so pretty i keep getting distracted i mean the only bad thing he did was record non  keng and probably someone else uploaded it idk i love him too much

barcode the actor you are
thats it 


barcode gutted me this episode yet again really selling the misery and then the descent these flashback eps have been brutal just watching all these men preying on non in every way emotionally monetarily sexually etc there was an analysis i read too that stuck with me  everyone romanticallysexually interested in non thinks theyre going to be the one to save him and gets annoyed when theyre not  and i love how it all come to a head this ep really hope hes still alive
found it wild that the netizen comments that non read mirror some of the irl discussions about nonkeng ive seen online so that was especially heartbreaking to see reflected in nons breakdown like that amazing foresight from the writers and goes to show how nuanced theyve purposely been making these toxic interpersonal relationships
idk how im ever supposed to forgive jin tbh lol i really hope phee destroys him at this point even his last minute defense of non to the friends pissed me off it just feels so hollow when we also know he continues to be these peoples friends in college and lie for them plus the revenge porn filming was just cruel love jins character so much and im glad hes there his role is so so interesting but i do hope he dies hahaha
now tee logically i know he should die too i know i know but he has hot tall meow meow privilege in my head so im still rooting for a satisfying redemption somehow some way idk hes probably gonna die and deserve it lmao but ill miss his handsome face also his actor is definitely the strongest imo of the newcomers
another great episode its so engaging and i am absolutely loving this series

this was the first time they mentioned that non has a sibling new i wonder if white or tan is is nons brother trying to see whats good or out for revengeance 
also this show has such funnysharp really good characterspecificdefining dialogue like this is such a fluke thing to say lmao

new was mentioned previously in episode 5 theres been a lot of speculation as to whether hes in the show or not

oooh ok t4p


im glad i stuck with the series long enough for it to get to the non backstory i was not into the first episodes because im a horror fan so the horrorslasher stuff was not giving ill be honest but both the boys from kp are hard carrying for me barcode impressed me so much ta is giving me exactly what i need from him also very impressedthe backstory with all the evil stuff they did to him has been very good hard to watch because of how horrible what happened is but that section hooked me i just hope that the return to the slasher revenge stuff holds up because it was not very good at the beginning but im invested in the plot now so that will definitely help just no more slow menacing walk ups while the boys scream and stumble awkwardly if they can make the revenge attacks feel tense and fast it could redeem the whole first part for me

what an episode i have never watched a horror that im left rooting for the masked killers before who is tan brother maybe is non alive would they really kill off the tragic protagonist was the film a hint at jin being the one to survive but then what did white do is he in on it every week im left with more questions but each episode is getting soooo good


bocs cinematography
phees smash brothers sarcastic clap is everything



im a certified fan of barcode now wow he was a kid crying and a loving brother in kinnporsche but him as non his expressions when he was going crazy wow hes so freaking talented i really like his characterin the series hes the life to the series i said what i said wow pond really did a great job recruiting him im impressed his micro expressions were not awkward i can feel his emotions he knows the correct angles and what makes him stand out like i didnt feel anything off with his acting and jj too is nailing it jj us and barcode are my favs here like they really can acti was so into kp once so maybe im biased i guess i also like others too
tacopper flukeglasses guy tee top and tan are good too wicked gang is perfect  i also dont know who tan is like i thought he was nons brother but hes abroad nd a college student so  idkunless he dropped out bcoz of lack of funds or wants revenge on his frnds bcoz their family fell aparti cant think of anyone else who was close to nonand i also like pheeta like he got cheated still he seeks justice for non  like he got moralsim also sick of jin acting so pure i guess someone else uploaded the video bcoz laptop turned off and he was drunk etc bcoz pheejin are like leads so theyll detoxify jin i guess still id only give fluke the pass he was bystander and selfish tho but atleast he did not hurt non directly
i cant wait to see whats yet to unfold  i really love this series they really spiced up the show a lot
also special mention nons parents fighting was so realisticive been there lol like i felt nons painand barcode really impressed me in that scene



best episode yet i was hooked from start to finish this show has gotten sooo good
non  theres nothing else i can say about barcode hes everything  i cheered when he got a piece of top with the knife but where the fuck is he i dont care about keng
phee  lfg sir lfg get to the bottom of it and make em all pay  him slow clapping in the theater i loved it i think he was eyeing jin specifically so hes found his way in i think soooo here we go
the quick recap of the of episode 7 and the last 10mins really confirmed for me that i need a tabarcode series of their own something about barcodes explosiveness and tas quiet subtlety that would be amazing i wonder howd they do at comedy
the shitheads  i to hate these assholes tees still my favorite i really like jjs face cause of his storyline hes complex with his uncle who is the key to nons whereabouts flukes the effects team me me and me line had me giggle por is trash and im here for it cause i love us who doesnt top i can takeleave probably hes my least favorite
jin  oh how far youve fallen  i was rooting for you you really are spineless and its gonna eat you alive at this point i hope phee is playing you in the present and hes the better actor and he doesnt even act
edit i dont hate jin he clearly cares for non im just disappointed which is always worse  but ive got a feeling hell redeem himself so 
finally tan but is he the brother 999 sure he is but  but please dont tell me white is just an innocent bystander in all this and just hooks up with tee i really want my tanpheewhite schemingrevenge trio
but now that i think about it im ok with him just being the innocent bystander he was just there for a good time
hi there perth 


i saw on tumblr something about schrdingers non and i am both crying and laughing
the way my jaw was on the floor for 98 of this episode mom and dad fighting really got to me so many adults failed non at so many levels and its shown a lot this time and jin not admitting his own faults out loud and fluke saying hes not part of it the fuck
also i have a question and im on mobile and spoiler tags havent been working for me so spoiler of a question was that tan in the theater i tried pausing and couldnt tell im assuming yes because of the teaser but idk and we saw perth maybe he becomes a bigger player as time goes


it looks like mio so yeah i would say it is tan but i have been looking through the crowd for that red shirt and found it nowhere so they were not seating together with phee who is clearly seen on a lot of scenes in the theatre


update friend  iqiyi posted on xitter asking and pinging fuaiz and mio if they knew who is that person the eyes dont look like fuaiz imo so it has to be mio what is interesting is that he was not here with phee but randomly so who is he really and what was he doing there


cause of death the heart killers 
does look like it


non has the most tragic life in all of bl history it was horrible at least if hes dead hes finally at peace 
finally we saw perth i wonder who is he tees cousin dd


in my villain era
weve all been waiting for it and here we are non coming ungluedhonestly i think they could have leaned into it harder flowers to barcode though he is doing the absolute most in this series
plot heavy episode no warningstime stamps are needed
they teased non writing about the deaths but im thinking its a red herring and as the preview is implying phi is out for revenge uncovering the truth
love that everyone has ulterior motives and trash people


cause of death the heart killers 
yep everyone seems to have their own agenda and i pray white is on team phee 


in my villain era
so i was thinking what if phee is playing the long game here hes intentionally trying to lure jin in because he found out what he did and is waiting for his chance to get revenge
i think non being the killer is too obvious what if its nons brother helping phee
this all conjecture is based on the aggressive amount of horror i watch


cause of death the heart killers 
im trying to think like sammon here i dont think this is gonna end up being a ghost story ive assumed new was older than non do we have confirmation of that or its just something we all thought because he didnt live with his parents what if new is younger than non and as you say hes helping phee what if new is white


i am starting to think we have three forces here that are not working together and will collide 
phee and tan which are best friends and tan has been recruited by phee to help him find what happened to his precious lover
white who is new the brother i cant see him knowing phee i mean we dont see any kind of attempt at communication between new and non right  even at his bottom  or worse tan or he knows phee from what he found in nons desk but cant be sure of his implications also appeared out of thin air after parents decide to invest money into looking for non if new is white he is tech savvy and can find everything he needs in nons computer to trace troubles back either to phee or to pors group
finally non because as long as i dont have a body i will believe out there with his crutch trying to get revenge for himself has he been helped by perth or simply paid his debt after three years will he be disfigured i even wondered if they have like sewn together his lips so that he never talks or has he been freed when uncle went to prison but was unrecognisable
i am pretty sure they dont work together which explains the messiness


bocs cinematography
i also wonder if perth will have a bigger role to play where non is involved hes acting as joes masseuse when we see him but he could also be doing more sex trafficking and slavery is totally a thing with gangsters so if non is paying off his debt they could run into each other


cause of death the heart killers 
but phee and jin were spared when they hid in the coffin maybe that wasnt luck but intentional if pgee doesnt know that jin was the one posting the vid he would try to spare him top taking the spear off seems to me like he got drugged or maybe he is just salty about pors behavior during the premiere of the movie he was always saying he was pretty convincing as his character and everyone was dismissing him now who killed the uncle top so he could get the setting he wanted fir his own revenge


i dont know if phee and jin were willingly spared knowing that people analysed that it was probably not top under the mask because the clothes do not match except if its a production blunder but for the moment i would like to think it unlikely
so who is under the mask  tan phee and jin and every other boy apart from top are accounted for at that point but masked man had black shoes and top has white shoes so non 
and then wouldnt it be an artefact of non not wanting to kill phee he let go of jin and phee and goes for tee instead but why tan  maybe he does not recognise him or take him for por i really dont know
top clearly look out of his mind be it drugged or just so frayed at the edges that he looses it specifically his overall attack seemingly seizure and his denouncing of tees actions
was the uncle a mistake  or a fake or just something we are sorely lacking context for for me non can be crazed enough to just kill because it is useful uncle dent had to die as the one who brings food and drives the car maybe
i am so lost but trying to find what makes sense and nothing properly connects which is perfect because i both dont want to be able to plan what is going to happen but i dont want them to subvert expectations at all cost like some other occidental show did which destroyed their coherency
in my villain era
what if new is white
this omg that would be a fire plot twist we dont have an age confirmation just that hes the golden child son and not in the home they could be the same ageholy shit huntress what if theyre twins


oh my god thats literally what i wanted someone to say so badly also we literally saw how smart white is with the walkie talkies and everything so maybe thats bc he studied abroad ugh i never needed i theory to come true so bad

like fraternal twins that dont look alike or related that would be a big twist


in my villain era
you could do either i was thinking new turns out to be an identical twin and the killer working with phi


new being nons identical twin would probably drive everyone insane lol


cause of death the heart killers 
omfg youre saying white is new who is nons fraternal twin i need to lay doen for a bit im getting dizzy and everything 


in my villain era
lets call up sammon and tell her we got some thoughts about this


cause of death the heart killers 
we definitely do 


barcodes performance is so so good that these 4 episodes have been literally a torture for me non is gone and after how those motherf killed keng he probably had the same fate
por proves he has no soul in his body even recording when non attacked top for real but glad the others felt like non were they realized they were just expendable like non was
i dont feel any pity for nons parents they are probably the main reason non ended with a very low self esteem everyday compating with his perfect brother and then the stupid father slapping him my blood boiled so now you cry well fk you if you had supported your son maybe he should have ended in that mess
tee may be the most evil gay ive ever seen in a series lol he got rid of non selling him to his uncle and the he ask if he is fine sure boy a potential witness will be okay after being with a mob boss fking hypocrite it seems that white will just a bystander but i would have loved if he is in phees plan to make him fall
jin oh god jin what have you done you mess it big time you hindered an investigation and nons ghost will be following you for these 3 years you still defend non but when you had to do just just covered for them im so intrigued of how his relationship with phee will develop and why in the present timeline phee and tan are sympathetic to jin maybe they know something about jin we dont
phee and his eyes filled with regret for non and hate against the group are evrything tan and him are going to make their lives a living hell by the way can we say an is nons brother new he has been very smart in the present episodes and his and top disappearing and top coming back crazy is probably his doing
by the way in the present timeline that sleazy tees uncle is dead considering this series i doubt this is just a coincidence who do you think he kills him phee tan maybe nons parents


everyone must die not a single person spared 


another great episode i was so indifferent about this show up til ep 4 and now it consumes my thoughts every saturday morning boc cant keep getting away with these addicting shows
they gave us more pheenon flashback crumbs and i ate them up non having his mental breakdown and going between sad cryexcitementcrazy cryback to sad cry was heart breaking but wow kudos to barcode for acting through all those emotions in one scene
keng being hit by a car is the most stereotypical asian drama way to off someone lol seems like hes officially dead then though now i wonder why theyre being vague about non 
por is absolutely a piece of shit for using footage of the stabbing and taking credit for nons work but damn us looked so good during the premiere thank you stylists 
and look im still not thrilled by jin in this episode i realize tensions were high during the stabbing scene but its just so vague to admit to you were the one who hurt non the most and apologize but not tell him why and when hes being interviewed he lies about non being missing idk man maybe hell do something really big to redeem himself but as of this episode hes not my favorite copper was really glowing and handsome in his scenes though
im sooooo ready to see phee and tan infiltrate the group next episode and get the gears moving for whatever they end up plotting or if they plot at all  it could be that their only motivation for joining the group was to find out what happened to non rather than get revenge and therefore what ends up happening at the cabin is all due to actual ghostscult activity rather than a murder plot orchestrated by pheetannon



profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
oooft okay thoughts on ep 8 first barcode  what an actor honestly has portrayed non so so well por top tee fluke and jin  cowards bullies all round horrible people phee  i love you so much and your dad is a dilf  im so excited for next week tan asking all the right questions straight off the bat we love to see it revenge begins now


i just need clarification on the timeline
the stuff with non happens 3 years ago 5 years ago and then when do they jump forward to like when do tanphee join the group it just seems like months later
and then how long is it before we jump to the present time in the woods


in my villain era
i think its a year epsiode 1 when they were headed back to the cabin it was to party before they headed off to uni it is sort of nebulous though

am i they only person that noticed that non changed the whole script to make it more violent and gruesome for all the boy but jin survived i think that non made jin survive put of everyone because hes the only one he couldnt imagine killing i wonder if that point will come up later in the series when we get back to the present day i also wonder if jin was the one who posted the tape what would happen if nonmaybe ghost non found out about that

im 5050 on whether this show is going to have an amazingly compelling rich and intriguing ending or whether its going to be rather stock horror lol with what theyve given us so far im hoping desperately for the former but also steeling myself for the latter
first thing i want to get off my chest i remain an ardent and adamant jin defender its funny because at the beginning i was kind of like eh he comes across as kind of bratty i dont know what i think about him but as time has gone on and weve found out more  oh i really adore this character and the depth theyve given him
some of the fandom debate going on about his character is actually quite frustrating because i feel like its so black and white and ignores some of the things staring us in the face jin is the only one we see defending non over and over again including in situations where there is no benefit to him he defends non even when non is not around nullifying the to make him look good to non argument and catches flack for it from them nullifying the he wants to look good to his friends argument
is he perfect of course not hes an incredibly flawed character who has acted selfishly and made mistakes but imo hes the most redeemable of them all even when non is gone and jin has no idea whats happened to him and hes seen that his friends are capable of drugging someone yes he lies to the police  lots of people do when theyre scared shitless especially when they know that there are four other people who will say that theyre the ones lying
which leads me into the ongoing debate raging in the fandom as to whether or not this is a story of pure revenge or something more and i stand by what ive thought since the end of ep 6  im going to be so disappointed if this turns out to be a stock cliche revenge horror story revenge is like one of the most basic horror tropes and while it can be very satisfying to me it would not be the satisfying or compelling ending here
instead id like to see the show lean into the parallels that i can see here jin and phee both wanted to help non and failed both of them hurt him im not debating which one hurt him more lol and likely carry a lot of guilt over it that makes for some incredible potential if the two of them can find solace and comfort in each other also imagine phee got close to jin to find out information or maybe even with some revenge or justice in mind and then started catching feelings imagine the guilt and conflict that would make come up in him what about jin whenif he realizes who phee is
the potential is there in swathes and if the writers ignore it to go lol revenge im going to be so so disappointed i also feel like theres a lot in the narrative pointing towards it not being the case but thats another matter
questions
we saw more of perth but does he have more significance
who was talking to keng and what happened to their investigation
are non and keng still alive

i partially agree with you i can understand jin he wants to help but he doesnt know how hes in love and feels betrayed a conflict between heart and brain however one thing bothers me i trust that it wasnt him who leaked the video but the fact that he thought of filming it really bothered me 
i also want to see the relationship between phee and jin but if the series is to end like their movie with only one survivor i hope phee will be the survivor and i hope jin will learn the whole truth about pheenon before he dies if they decide to kill him 
for the questions i hope non is dead it would be better for the series but on the other hand i hope he and keng are alive for full revenge  keng was talking to the woman who was spying on the restaurant weve seen her in an episode before 


keng stuff confuses me like is he undercover police or newspaper or a cult lol

bocs cinematography
im with you on jin he has done extremely shitty things and some of the care for non has been performative but not all his feelings are genuine hes flawed but thats what makes him a good character its the same way i love and want to strangle tee his uncle was right in that hes a coward but to me there is more like jin has more whereas characters like por and top are just rotten top is absolutely a hired goon that sees himself as the main character and por is a rich piece of shit who will stomp over anyone who gets in his way of what he wants and fluke is totally spineless and thinks if he turns his head nothing happened


rwrb ofc bmftms
with three weeks late and without having seen more than ep 8 there is something that does not seem curious how is it possible for jin to see a bloody keng if no one knows his whereabouts since that scene i have thought that jin was involved in kengs death could he have been the one who ran him over in a fit of jealousy


i understand your point id view i love that jin is a complex character however for me his betrayal runs deeper than any one else its very difficult to forgive jin because his actuon had direct effect on nons life and for me he did all the bad things in disguise of being a good guy and loving non

stock horror with that kind of story its original and incredibly exciting i dont get what more couldve this show been

when i say stock horror what i mean is a stock trope thats used quite often in horror and as a motive
character has a secret connection to the victim in the past and is now here to kill everyone for revenge is pretty standard for horror slashers in particular often have this as a motivation for the killer
theres also the fact that from the very instant phee appeared on screen with non the entire fandom exploded with omg phee is here for revenge to kill them all  another reason its a stock concept its predictable and theres nothing particularly surprising about it
now can the surrounding storyline still be interesting and compelling sure but i wont find it nearly as fascinating as if they buck those fandom expectations surprise us and present something else entirely to resolve the plot



interesting i wonder how they could avoid the tropes but still have the ending satisfying in some way what would be interesting to you
its not original at all but i cant resist a revenge story like i fell in love with the count of monte cristo when i was a teenager its my perfect storyim typing on my phone so i cant italicize book title or i dont know how
before this episode i still had hope jin would still survive till the end but now i fully believe hell get killed
even though hes remorseful i think hes too far gone with the bully group to not be killed alongside them none of those 5 will survive
that leaves phee tan and white if they will follow the slasher trope with only one surviving final girl will definitely be phee while the other two will be casualties from the chaos

i just want jin to know all the truth before he dies i want him to know that phee loved non before and all stuff 
i kinda feel like phee fell in love with jin so lets see the endgame 

omg for some reason i went into this thinking it was the final episode so glad there is more phee and tan are gonna investigate i wonder when white comes in


i really hope white will come in next episode bc we all thought the backstory would be over by episode 8 but its clearly not haha maybe we get teewhite backstory cuz chronologically it would make sense if it happened at similar times as phee and tan getting introduced to the friendz


i have two running theories for white
hes new nons brother and comes back from abroad to investigate because his parents cant afford a lawyer he then finds tan and phee and works with them on the investigation and during it meets tee and either falls for him or takes advantage
very far fetched hes dating tan and decides to help with their investigation by getting with tee
umm either way i think white is affiliated in some way with phee and tan because they were really close at the house and i think being super close with ur friends young boyfriend is kinda weird idk
i hope everyone dies  im just unsure about the logistics with non being the killer 


every single one of them especially jins spineless self 


still believe non is alivetee drugged him thats why he went psycho on them tee and top disposed his bodymaybe they just threw him in the woods or down the river somewhere but he survivedphee is on a revenge fact finding missionta i think is older brother newbarcode


yeah but the issue is that the uncle said that te brought non to him so this doesnt work


you need to pay attention to what you watch the uncle got non 

this series is just so damn good  ill be honest i wasnt sure about it after watching the teasers but decided to follow along weekly and its just getting better and better usually i can work out a few things that might happen but up until this point i had no idea what was gonna happen the twist with phee and the tutor with non completely surprised me
barcode what a development hes made watching the first few minutes was heartbreaking but he completely sold it i see where phee and tan are coming into it from the teaser next week i wonder how white comes into the friendship group
what are your thoughts


considering they already revealed to us that tan transferred to the school with phee do we think it could be white calling out to phee in the movie theatre i couldnt see their face clearly so it would be a fun twist if white was in on it too
