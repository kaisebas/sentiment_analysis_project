Ugh poor Non going through so much abuse :( Barcode's acting is really great though, I hope we'll continue to see more of him in the next few episodes before jumping back to the present.

that said...

TACODE TACODE TACODEEEEEEE üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠!!!!

PheeJin is probably going to be endgame since we're assuming Non is dead/missing forever, but man my inner MacauChay from KP has reawakened and is absolutely vibrating at the PheeNon we're getting next episode.

Ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
My ghost ship (TaBarcode) is actually sailing?!? Truly I have never been so lucky.

I was cackling when the boys were sitting at the table at school and Jin was just casually watching KinnPorsche.

Tee and Top are garbage. Do we know what the favor was that Tee asked of him or is that still to be revealed? Still v excited for Top to die.

Now that we know Phi is the secret boyfriend, I wonder if the brother will be making an appearance. Perhaps Tan? I've been wondering how he's going to fit into all this, especially since he's very much taking initiative in the present day to find out what happened to Non.

Based on the preview, it looks like the shady tutor is finally making his move. My assumption is that Non tells him that he needs money to pay back the customer and the shady tutor offers it in exchange for sleeping with him. Because he's gross. Also excited to learn who gets to kill him.

omg if tan is the brother i will actually like scream!! I think that's honestly such a good answer to so many of my questions, but idk because this series is always making me shocked.

I agree SO MUCH that tee is garbage, but at least we got his backstory of why he's an asshole. i wonder what shit top has gone through to excuse his actions (they probably won't be)

If white is with tee for real and isn't a part of the revenge, I sincerely hope he DUMPS TEE'S ASS so hard. he should get with tan frfr cuz he's the only not trash and single guy.

Not sure, but Top definitely knew about the whole plot because of his :3 looking smirk when the others were asking if they got the letters about the bank accounts. "What? Letter? What letter? I'm totally innocent. Nothing!"

I‚Äôm changing my mind. I think White is Non‚Äôs brother. We don‚Äôt know for sure he was older and it would make sense that he attached himself to Tee since we know Tee was the main person who fucked Non over.

I still don‚Äôt know who Tan is though.

I am just so freaking happy, that some of my theories got proven right. I love this feeling. üòÇüòÇüòÇ I am so so so excited for the next episode! It really looks like the teacher is giving Non money in exchange for his life. What would prove the theory that he's part of the cult and they indeed sacrifice people üòÇ I agree with the people who like couples that aren't fixed and have them mixed up, but still...I kinda feel sad and betrayed for Jin. üíÄüòÇ At first I thought Tan would be ‚ù§Ô∏è and I think that would've been also pretty exciting, but it makes sense that it's Phee , since hes somehow like the 'main' main character.

I still don't exactly get why Por apologized for taking money from Non. Maybe because he wanted money from him at all? Because so far he obviously didn't steal from him, like I first assumed.

And I'm guilty. I laughed at Nons shirt. "I'm sick of everything" is such a mood.

And I loved how Jin is casually watching KinnPorsche at school! üíÄ

Ah, it's really really exciting and thrilling. I can't wait to get over all these flashbacks and come back to the present. üò´

Not them singing Porchay‚Äôs song when filming their short too üòÇ that made me snort so badly. So many Easter eggs.

I really like that teacher‚Äôs theory. But then, is he now dead ? And why would only Jin see him ? Or is he part of the revenge team ?

Also about Por, that‚Äôs very interesting. Did Por inquire about what happened, hence the newspaper about Tee‚Äôs uncle ? Did whatever happened to Non made him want to know what truly happened ? And now that consequences are facing him he regrets what, for him, was the trigger to all this ?

Which song is it? I was about to ask, because I didn't know the song but I assumed it was an Easter egg.

Por told us in the beginning that the people, who make the sacrifice for the cult, also kill themselves at the end. So maybe the teacher sacrificed Non and also killed himself.

About Por, I don't know. It felt like he regrets what happened back then, since he apologized for it and said "I shouldn't have taken the money from you" but in the other hand, before, he was very chilled with Tee, while they were talking (when they got the camera upstairs in the room) Tee said "what if they find out?" And he was like "yeah whatever, it's over, why should they care" or something like that.

It‚Äôs the song from KinnPorsche that Porchay, Barcode‚Äôs character, writes for Kim, his love interest ! It‚Äôs this song is called you. Barcode has two songs at the moment, No More Dreams and this one huhu.

Damn that would be gruesome. But then where does Jin go in here ?

Yeah but Por being and egoistical spoiled boy (with too high expectations that destroyed him as a person) maybe only properly reflected while half dead on his couch ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

OH MY GOD I AM SO READY FOR MORE

As someone who wants less established closed couples of actors I love the perspectives.

Damn I don‚Äôt know what I am allowed to discuss here‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs jump.

So Phee is there for revenge. Probably got Tan with him on it as planned beforehand. Kudos to people that has this on their theories !

THEY WERE FRIEND WITH BENEFITS AND THEN BOYFRIENDS ? Or is that just Phee‚Äôs line but it‚Äôs actually said to Jin ?

Barcodes acting. Daaamn dude.

Sammon really looked at him and was like ‚ÄúPeople love you and you cry well. Let‚Äôs traumatise you so much.‚Äù As she should.

Also I have to give it to Us he does not look one year older than the rest of the group. Great acting.

Tee‚Äôs character is incredible. So stuck in a bad place but no will to go out (can he ? Probably not, but he doesn‚Äôt even try anymore). Really looking forward to how White enters the picture.

We still haven‚Äôt seen Non strangling Top. So they will go back in the woods later. How ? Why ?

TA‚Äôs arrival üò≠ I loved it. Even with the spoilers I already had I was so ready.

So many layers of story.

So Non is someone with a mental sickness (so many pills a disappointment compared to his big brother, a source of dispute between his parents probably both for his mental sickness and his upbringing. Damn what a life.

And damn do a lot of people have the hots for that boy (as they should he is glorious).

There are layers, and so many details (did you catch that the news channel is called BOC for BeOnCloud ? üòÇ).

I want more this is really so much more than just a slasher serie.

I am imagining (exaggeratedly of course) then pitching the idea to Ta : ‚ÄúSo dude, you‚Äôre gonna be steamy with Copper of course, but also in love and steamy (maybe ? I kinda hope?) with Barcode. Also you will violently avenge him in blood with any weapons of your choice.‚Äù

We don‚Äôt really know, but Phee has to be around for a reason. I really hope Non is around too.

I have to go back to my analysis thread and see we came to happen and what is still pending !!

Pretty much the extremes are the adults from parents both rich and poor as well as those "mafia" scammer pyramid schemers to the possibly pervy culty kinda hot teacher.

I hope they write a novel that uses the drama and gives us different POVs and extras that fill in time gaps that there's not enough time for the series to use since it's only 12 episodes.

Yeah, it's not a surprise that PheeNon knew each other, since the Thai Nicknames always have a connection if they are used in this way. The question was only if they are siblings or lover. üòÇ I would have loved if Tan was ‚ù§Ô∏è but as I said in another comment, it makes sense that it's Phee, also given the fact that he's something like the "main" main character (kinda leader of the group etc)

So I went back to watch NoMoreDream MV because of course I am obsessed and hyper fixating.

Maybe the second person in the MV is Ta. There is a faint trace of his tattoo on a finger in one pictures.

Also the preview show is Phee and Non next to a body of water. In the MV, it‚Äôs Phee and Jin that are near a very similar body of water. Jin is often show a with stripes and he appears in clip behind Barcode singing multiple times. Phee is holding a camera. These are mixed with JinNon shots.

THEY ARE MUDDYING THE TRAIL SO MUCH MY DUDES

And someone holding a nice picture of TeePorTopFlukeJin and Non after filming. Non is holding the terror mask so it‚Äôs the part we are still missing (where Non strangles Top and plays the bad guy).

Damn, this show is fucking incredible. There is so many threads! Barcode's acting was phenomenal this episode. No wonder everyone is in love with him. I loved the way that they showed how Jin was falling for Non - how everything was fading away for him except Non and his voice and he was just pulled to him like a magnet. Professor is giving big red flags. WHY WAS HE TARGETTED AS AN EFFIGY OF LEAVES??? What did you do, Keng?????

We see that Phee isn't what he seems, but I still think neither is White. He saw himself covered in boils and there is the supernatural element. I'm still wondering if he's secretly evil. Tee is a very interesting character. He's absolutely doing dick move shit, but he's caught in a tough spot too. So he's not good, but he's not wholly bad either. I need to know how this whole thing comes together because it's so damn interesting.

Also, Por and his entire family can fucking die. Oh wait - Por already did hahahahaha

We think alike here ! (Also LOVE your flair).

I really don‚Äôt know where to stand with Keng but 2J acting is impressive. I barely recognise him and he goes that line between creepy and caring with mastery. I am a teacher myself and he makes my head spin.

White hides something, that‚Äôs what I think too, but I wonder how he fits in the rest. Trailers have me the feeling that he targeted Tee and was the one to pursue him romantically.

They give us crumb by crumb that‚Äôs really masterful.

At first I thought Tee's line in the first episode about "You said you'd behave if you came" was Tee being controlling, but honestly... what if it was to keep White in line? We already know that Tee associates with bad people - maybe White is involved with that part of his life somehow?

If white is some evil Janta cult acolyte, I will be gagged, gooped, and gooned.

White & Non both fall into this box for me which is why I'm hoping the show lends more nuance to them. Like at least Jin has the depth of being friends with questionable characters and going along with the whole scheme etc... But so far White and Non are presented as completely innocent.

In fairness Non is the victim whose desperately lonely and in need of friends. So the pure part we see is still nuanced in his pain and becomes layered in becoming (presumably) the psycho murderer.

White always striked me as such an interesting character, I really need to see white and tee's backstory to make some proper judgement!!

But right now I think him, tan, and phee are definitely working on SOMETHING together, because I remember when the three of them (plus jin) were talking and idk would you get along with your friends boyfriends THAT well???

I think rn my guess is that White has something to do with the revenge, so I'm just rly curious to see whether he's with Tee for his plan, or he got together before then learnt the truth about him. Still, the way he didn't question anything about Tee's uncle when Fluke asked him rly got me thinking. DEF NOT a normal relationship

I am not sure. For me, the teacher is alone involved in the Cult, where on the other hand we have Phee, Tan and White together.

We know Non's parents have money problems. We also know that Non isn't really interested in staying alive. The teacher in the preview offers him money, in exchange for his life (at least that is what it sounds like). So my theory is, the teacher gives him money, Non takes it to help his parents and therefore gets sacrificed for the cult - which is a win-win for Non, since he doesn't want to live anymore. And suicide doesn't seem to work, since everyone is interrupting all the time. üòÇ And maybe Phee also keeps a closer eye on him now.

I don't know the time line for Phee and Ji being friends with benefit, but I assume Phee started it after whatever happened to Non. I remember when they mentioned that they became friends with the gang a year after Non's disappearance.

So my theory is that they all had long term plan for revenge. Phee, Tan. But I feel White can be the older brother or someone they know because he is so far removed from the story that his place in the story seems cruel!

I already feel bad for Jin, although it was before he met Phee and I think Phee and Non are cute together. I don't want two timing being involved. üíÄüòÇ

But since there are also mysterious blurry quotes from the writers about if it's really okay if they kill people and split up a couple, I just expect the worst and no happy ending for anyone. üòÇüòÇ

so far phi, jin, (and white I guess) are in the clear. will tee get a redemption arc? üò© he has problems but dragging your classmate into it is such a dick move omg.

Oh God, It's Phee. I thought he would be Non's brother, not the lover but I really like it.

Definitely he is out for blood and I'm loving it, after what those monsters did to Non they deserve hell, especially Tee and Por (Well, he bit the dust already üòã)

Phee told Jin he wouldn't allow anything happen to him so I wonder if he is in the revenge plan or at least Phee knows that like him, Jin loved Non and it's innocent.

By the way Tee's uncle appears death at the first of the story in the present day. I wonder if Phee will kill him for threatening Non and the same with the teacher who seems a pervert.


I'm loving this series.

Another fun ep! I am rooting for a Phee/Non revenge plot and rooting for them to get away with murder lolol. Barcode's misery was so good, I totally relate to Phee willing to kill for Non because same. So hype to watch all those jerks die.

However I am somehow still weirdly fond of Tee idgi when he was such a dick lmao maybe this is handsome/tall privilege in action oops. I will accept it but be sad if he dies.

This episode had me shook.

When I finished Kinnporsche while Kimchay were just okay for me I secretly would have loved to see ChayMacau and never in a million years did I think I would get it in another universeüò≠

Im still team PheeJin though but Im going to enjoy TaBarcode as much as they will giveüíï

Poor Non just couldn't catch a break like how on earth did things go so wrong.

Its a first for me to watch a horror setting and root for half the cast to die horribly rather than survive.

If Non is still alive and getting his revenge its Por down and Top and Tee at least need to pay. There is not a single redeemable quality in either of them.

Fluke and White are still a mystery though I wonder if White is clean he will end up as collateral damage for Tee going down

okay SO it's looking more and more like this is completely planned by humans and like realistic fiction right? But what about that dark hand in episode one where tee and white were making out? Like is that even related to the plot? and who would be "controlling" the hand because there's no way someone was just sitting there. OMG if this turns into some supernatural thing I don't know if I'm going to be happy or upset...

ok got to ep6 ...nothing seems crazy or unexpected tbh went back to ep1 again and Phee's scene with Jin....for science lol and it is still one of the hottest scenesü•µü•µü•µ. Ta is REALLY giving it his all Copper is just SO PRETTY his features are so delicate and they kiss AMAZING TOGETHERüî•üî•üî•...yes I got sidetracked ok

So Non getting bullied by all the boys who are trying to cover up the original movie footage? No surprise there. Phee (Ta) being Non's lover ok that one is unexpected sort of, in ep1 the way Phee was acting, I 100% thought he was Non's best friend or brother or some other close person to Non and was coming back under cover to find out what really happened to Non or to get revenge for Non.

Also Tan when he said he would go under cover with the other side (the original movie boys) immediately made me think he was secretly plotting with Phee and also here undercover. So I guess rewatching the HOT scene in ep1 between Phee and Jin makes me think that Jin and Phee were friends and were hooking up and Jin knew that Phee was also hooking up with Non and maybe it wasn't that Jin liked Non, maybe he was trying to see why Phee liked Non? That triangle is interesting and by interesting I just want Ta to make out with Copper again tbh üò´ü•µüî• I don't think Barcode will make out with anyone tbh so putting all my chips on Jin and Phee.

Fluke being a selfish prick and KNOWING but allowing Non to be blamed is on-brand with how he acted throughout no surprise. Top same. Tee same. Por same. Blah. Bullies are horrible and I hate them all. No redemption. Bye. Off with their heads.

White is a cutie eventhough binging the episodes make me find him annoying. With proper dosing I like White. I didn't even like the hot scenes with Tee and White because from ep1 Tee felt like a coward and a bully.

So I only need White, Jin, and Phee to survive. And Non if he wants to make out with White I will take that. The rest of them can all disappear honestly, no redemption needed ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don't even need them to make out because their bullying immediately un-hot's them so no need. Bye bullies. Off with your heads. The tutor teacher? Sammon makes me think human trafficking? ü§î maybe? Although why did the tutor teacher smile when Non got the math question right? Made me think he would find him useful for gambling and counting cards? Otherwise why would you want a smart kid for human trafficking purposes?

I haven't even watched yet but the spoilers I've seen and the hints at next week honestly have me contemplating putting this show on hold until it's finished and I know exactly what I've signed up for.

Considering that Ta and Copper won THC and this is supposed to be their prize, I'm not really a fan of where this seems to be going, though it'd explain the lack of marketing for them as a pair. It feels like a bit of a bait and switch, with PheeJin being pushed in the first episode only for everything to be something else entirely.

Again, I haven't watched yet, but I really don't know if I even want to because the spoilers have left such a bad taste in my mouth.

Edit: Having now watched the episode I'm still not a fan of how they are handling the romances here. Which is a pity because the rest of the show is well done and layered! Also I said this in a comment further down, but I'm really not a fan of how Non is being centered here in a show that is the prize for THC. It just feels unfair to Ta and Copper to have Barcode - who already has a huge following - be centered in their show. On top of that his character also lacks the depth that the rest of the characters have, because he has no shades of grey to him so far - he's just an innocent baby victim who has done nothing wrong. In theory this is fine, but it has pitfalls in a show like this where you have other characters doing awful things due to the situations they're in. Hopefully this changes.

That being said, I'm a tad more hopeful that this isn't just pure revenge for Phee, but I think I need to put my BL/romance hopes thoroughly on the backburner for this show and center the horror again and basically expect anything/everything.

It's more a matter of deciding whether or not I want to devote my time to something. I watch shows because they make me happy or I enjoy them, if I'm going to watch only to be sad and frustrated then I don't see the point, you know? Like I just decided against watching Last Twilight, for example, due to spoilers I saw about how it ends. I don't need that sort of disappointment.

It's partly my own fault for forgetting that BOC does really push the boundaries of traditional BLs etc. I know what's typical and expected in horror (I LOVE the genre) but I didn't expect some of it here because it's a BL and I probably shouldn't have let my thoughts go down that path.

This show could still be salvageable to me, but I think the main fear I have is that it'll turn out that Phee is faking everything and doesn't have any feelings for Jin at all, which would really sour my thoughts on how the show presented them and how Ta and Copper have been treated.

Edit: I don't usually complain, but c'mon people, I don't downvote you for being excited for stuff I dislike so it'd be nice if you didn't downvote me for not being happy üíÄ

Oh I know üò≠ I think I'm just really nervous about the possibility that there's no feelings there at all, partly because some of Phee's actions will then not make sense if that's the case. (Like why did he save Jin in episode four?)

If this was a horror movie I'd be completely fine lol, I'm used to this sort of thing (Scream, anyone?) but it's still marketed as a BL and I want my PheeJin hahaha. Plus I really don't like love triangles or cheating and I'm a little nervous that's what's going on.

I think the feelings are genuine. The way he was in the coffin about protecting Jin didn't seem fake, unless he's a supreme actor. Personally I LOVE that they aren't doing it the typical BL route (since I'm kind of atypical BL watcher in that my faves are the ones that are about something else besides the romance - I'm never really a romance first genre person, and like the ones that are more just queer content than a straight up romance like Moonlight Chicken, Only Friends, Manner Of Death, Not Me, this show, etc)

I'm very intrigued at how we got here. Maybe Phee got feelings for Jin because Jin was the only one of that group who treated Non like a human, and he at first found solace in him after Non disappeared? Dunno. It's a shame if you do give up the show because it's so damn good, but you gotta do what you gotta do. It's for entertainment after all.

Yeeeeah what's making me nervous is that this is a tried and true trope in horror - supposedly the one person has feelings, but in truth it's all ~A Lie~ and they're out for revenge and will do anything for it. Combine that with 'one of the pairings won't get a happy ending' and I'm very :| about it all.

I think I just need to adjust my mentality back to 'this is horror first and foremost' and stop worrying about the BL aspect. The BL aspect can be saved in fanfic but in the show I'm just gonna assume that Phee's out for revenge and nothing more, that way I can be pleasantly surprised if he does have genuine feelings after all.

Oh one thing I'll add is that partly what has me feeling so sour about this is the marketing/presentation in the context of the BL genre. Like in traditional horror it's one thing to be sold a relationship and then have it turn out to be all a scheme, in BL that feels a bit like dirty play. But again, BOC is a company that wants to push boundaries so it's probably my fault for forgetting about that in my excitement about PheeJin.

I get you, I‚Äôm heavily on the PheeJin train too, but I love this twist.  The one thing I wanted was for TaBarcode scenes, and I‚Äôm getting my wish so I‚Äôm excited.  

I don‚Äôt think Phee is playing with Jin in the present time, otherwise his actions make no sense.  He literally only thinks about this boys safety (who is getting hurt a lot by the wayüòÇ.) Plus, I can‚Äôt see Jin doing anything wrong to Non at this point, so Phee won‚Äôt touch him.

I think Non disappears, leaves Phee broken hearted, but he‚Äôs vengeful.  He uses Jin to infiltrate the friend group, and I‚Äôm sure he catches feelings but he won‚Äôt take it further cause he‚Äôs on a mission.  

Phee/Non are my fav characters at this point, so I‚Äôm excited to analyze further about their history.  But I really want Phee to go ballistic on everybody, and we know he doesn‚Äôt back away from a fight so ‚Ä¶LFG!

Only thing that throws me off is the damn supernatural element. This part stumps me and it‚Äôs annoying.

If you asked me for a list TaBarcode would be at the bottom lolol. Mostly because Ta and Copper won THC so tbqh part of me is really quite salty on their behalf that this has become the Barcode show. I adore Barcode but DFF is supposed to be Ta and Copper's show, not his, AND he has Wuju coming out so the Bible fan in me is also steaming about this.

I think I'm going to continue watching under the assumption that Phee is just in this for revenge and not expect anything from PheeJin. It seems like the safest especially with the fact that the writer hinted at one of the pairings not getting a happy ending, I just assumed it'd be TeeWhite because, you know, this was supposed to be Ta and Copper's show.

It was one of the writers back at the beginning talking about how he discussed with BOC about what they would let him do, and two of the things were whether or not he could really have one of the pairings have an unhappy ending, could he really kill off x character, etc etc. It could all be misdirect but this latest twist has me wondering.

Sorry if I sounded judging I was just naively wondering by the way ! Not judgy at all.

I really wonder because for now Jin has been nothing but lovely and infatuated with Non. I really wonder how they will meet, how they will start their relationship as friends with benefits.

I personally LOVE that we don‚Äôt know where this is going in regard to coupling. I love a good old love story like in KP where we knew Porsche was never going away from Kinn for real etc. But I love that more realistically things change, and the options are real people and not just ‚Äúchallenge to overcome for main couple‚Äù. I started with no opinion (TaCopper leaves me indifferent even if their first scene was absolute fire) so something like that is really interesting.

Anyway as I will absolutely watch the rest if you need someone to give you info without spoilers I would gladly help !

Well he‚Äôs playing as a side character and his role is really important they are all connected to non if non was not their the whole plot wouldn‚Äôt make sense and I feel like you are annoyed that non is getting in the way of your pheejin ship when both jin and phee love non and it seems like they still have feelings for him which I‚Äôm happy because those three have amazing chemistry

You should go look at the theories on ticktock because a lot of people think that jin has an obsession with non a lot of people don‚Äôt trust jin they are sus of him
