non going off on tee is so heartbreaking hes completely right poor kid he didnt do anything to deserve this and hopefully tee feels like the pos he is it is good to know hes not a complete psycho willing to let non be killed but he definitely still sucks


cause of death the heart killers 
that scene was a punch to the gut because he was spitting facts tee intervening on behalf of non because he didnt want to carry that guilt on his conscience but ultimately only delayed the inevitable was poetic to say the least


i had to pause the episode at multiple points to go and take a mental health walk what a rough episode


thats what i have been doing since episode 10


please dont let me down i dont need a happy ending but i need a good ending


at this point there can be no happy ending i just hope they dont make new kill them all next week what a disaster


meanwhile i hope they do lmao im rooting for new


the absolute duality i love that that we can safely root for either outcome is really good

what is a good ending at this point i want to see it too but im not sure what it is anymore


in my villain era


in my villain era
at this point i honestly have no idea how they are going to end this we are barreling towards the end and im at the edge of my seatas long as they dont pull a whisperer im all good
i did like they focused on tee in this episode they gave him more depth and hummanized the moral ambiguity of everyone in this series is so well done
no sexy time or scary time this go around but
4100  makeout with white and tee


cause of death the heart killers 
the whisperer did the last episode finally come out
im starting to brace for the fact that the police will find a camera and its gonna be find footage on how they all died


in my villain era
the whisperer did the last episode finally come out
i like youre ending huntress that would be a great one texas chainsaw massacre styleand or its all in news head like the ending devils chair


cause of death the heart killers 
the hallucinogens might be kicking new too thats a possibility 

nope it didnt come out i have notifications on for their youtube channel i feel like im waiting 84 years for that episode 


didnt new delete and turn off everything

cause of death the heart killers 
tee sucks big time and i cant begin to explain how fed up everything he did to non was keeping him alive was more about his own conscience and not about what was best for non and then they sucker punched us with tees origin story and grey characters have never been better although this episode seemed to throw that theory to the drain i still hope a last plot twist with white ugh that kiss on the stairs was so cute
now non is dead and ive never felt so sad for being right his little note left me with a heartache that i cant explain i pumped my fist when phee told new he loved non he always will and now that he knows what hapoened he can move on unlike new who really is out for their heads
i think we can fairly say that the ending next week wont be a happy one
please if anyone can translate thr sticky notes on the board phee new were actually the meme


bocs cinematography
i legit shed tears at that shot of the burning note falling through the black sky what a gorgeous heartshattering shot


cause of death the heart killers 
the im not a loser bit how fed up it is that some of that otherness that non felt must have been his sexuality and tee instead of relating to bim threw hom to the wolves 
edit happy cake day may you have a reddit blast today 


pors mom sucksssss all of the adults on this show are abhorrent its like a roald dahl novel
yeah thats a great question i mean i still dont understand why non was targeted and bullied the way he was why did they call him greasy
maybe it was nons sexuality that the group hated him for despite jin and and tee also being secretly queer i guess we never found out if por fluke or top are queer or straight so if they are straight and jin and tee were closeted at the time it could be homophobia that motivated their bullying
non wasnt poor and he is also good at school and physically stronglarger than some of the other boys i get that his personality was a bit alternative so maybe thats why he was picked on being weird hard to say


bocs cinematography
oh thanks i didnt even really realize it was cake day hahaha i was too focused on typing about this masterpiece of a show


it didnt seem like non had an ounce of sleep food or water he was so weak like starved like how can they expect him to be an indentured servant working like a mule when he was so weak normally you hear those nasty mafiabrothel people tend to take care of you while adding to your debt oh medicine bandaids etc thats going to cost you 100x the price of it and it will be added to your overall debt so that his debt never ends


cause of death the heart killers 
sammon always guts me i know i can stomach murder but when she goes into human trafficking it becomes so triggering to me


the start of the episode was soooo hard to watch it was so sad then just having nons storyline just all in my face at once with non struggling throughout was just sooo sad tees storyline was rough rough rough i couldnt even ship him with white who btw i love them together and i think white is perfect for tee who is always soooo inlove with white it was just soooo sad all around


cause of death the heart killers 
it was just soooo sad all around
facts i dont think white will get over this its too much 


if any of them even survive new has lost all his grasp on reality


cause of death the heart killers 
and so is everyone else now that they are hallucinating





the sticky notes are just the guys name  its the first thing i went and looked up


bocs cinematography
 i had to pause a couple of times because i couldnt stop crying and im someone whos considered aloof with thick walls built around me so thats not typical for me jjay fucking killed me this episode when his dad cupped his face and then started laughing about his grey hair my heart broke especially after perths character said paraphrase in this life if you have to choose you choose yourself tee has never chosen himself even when we see him being completely wrong with non and non was absolutely correct to hate him for it but he got into this life to help his dad and he refused to leave non behind and then in the present hes willing to put himself in front of a bullet for white what a heartbreaking fucking character hes done wrong and should be punished but hes so nuanced and messy and he really is trapped in that life when he burned nons note and it floated away it was such a gorgeous shot but my heart was shattered
 oh fucking hell white was tees salvation he told himself he didnt deserve love and then here came this beautiful boy and insisted on pushing himself into tees life so there isnt some big mastermind there where white is an evil twink i kinda would have lived but how we see that white was a glimpse of the life that tee wanted like how he yelled at his father  he just wanted to be a normal happy kid i feel like hes also going to wind up being tees end tee will sacrifice himself to save white and the only goodness he was able to scrounge out of life
 white must be ill we saw him hallucinating those boils and then he sees tee being disgusted by him when his fear is revealed
 phee and new show how different justice and vengeance are they may have had the same goal as the truth but new is ready to burn the world phee is his fathers son  hes not a murderer new is doing an extended suicide he never wanted to come out of this alive and now that he knows non is dead there is no going back after this he wanted the truth but new has pushed this whole thing to the point of insanity
 i was really hoping that non would come back alive but i guess that was too much to ask for considering how fucking deep into hell he was just like perths character said  there is no going back once youre in that life but i still am holding out hope that someone bought non and uncle joe was just saying that to keep tee out of the business and how did uncle joe die
 i dont know if its coincidence or just because its a popular spot for local teenage boys but that stairwell where white and tee kissed was the same area where we saw phee and non kissing
 a lot of things seemed to be answered this week but i still have more questions so it doesnt feel like the last episode is just going to be round up and i still wonder if jin is going to be the final girl just like in the short movie and hell be the only one running out of that house alive

i agree with you completely also tee was just a kid he was trying so hard to not have any feeling so he could survive he had no support at all much less from an adult he was so invisible to everyone especially his friends i dont think he even realized that non could actually get hurt until it was far too late tee is not good but hes not bad either he really is the definition of gray before the episode started i said to my husband that i hoped they were going to be able to keep up the pace of how good this has been and not fumble it in the last episodes and so far so good tee was one of the more mysterious characters and i feel completely satisfied with his arc and poor baby white when he says i didnt even want to come and you see the enormity of guilt in tees its shakespeareanigly tragic so is the fact that news entire family is dead this has hands down been the most intense bl ive ever watched


bocs cinematography
i think its really beyond bl now this is honestly one of the most intense shows ive ever watched just the spiral into insanity of how we got here

happy cake day 


fudanshi
i was thinking greek tragedy while watching those scenes


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i noticed that about the stairwell and was wondering the backstory of the official gay teen hookup spot 


fudanshi
agreed these characters are so messed up while still pulling at your sympathies for the terrible circumstances they have been forced into


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
woof that one was tough despite everything i do feel bad for tee hes also being taken advantage of and abused that being said non was right with everything he said and tee doesnt get to resolve himself of guilt because it was such a long time ago it was 3 years not 50
it was really interesting that tees father was suffering from debilitating mental illness not physical illness that forces tee to have to support them it made me feel so much worse for tee and how trapped he is
poor white seems like he really did just get caught up with the wrong group and now is going to be emotionally traumatized for the rest of his life which may end up being like 2 more hours
pors mom sucksssss all of the adults on this show are abhorrent its like a roald dahl novel
does anyone else think that non may secretly still be alive i know its a longshot but maybeeeee
anyway im sad now so im gonna go watch the pheenon falling in love montage 8 times in a row


i kind of think he is still alive but also i dont think he should be im starting to think this is all fakea dreamthe movie theyre actually making


i cant belive por said that about tutor kang he was correct


this i saw a reaction video where the actor playing kang said he was good and i was like um no i was worried that in thailand that wasnt considered grooming pors comment brought me relief


rwrb ofc bmftms
the most ironic thing is that that phrase was said by a person who despised non while the two boys who were supposed to love him were the first to judge him and turn their backs on him

king shit stanning tan forever tbh
tho boc really is on another level i was totally swooning over teewhites blossoming little romance 


tannew they can never make me hate you


bocs cinematography
newtan has truly become the scarecrow hes in his arkham asylum era
i honestly wouldnt be surprised if this whole thing ends with them all dead but tbh i really want white and phee to come out of all this alive and as ok as one can be in this situation people are hating on phee a lot and like i agree that him liking jin is bad and like def a betrayal considering jins involvement with everything but i dont think him turning on new was something to hate on like phee is a genuinely good guy so its pretty in character for him to not want to kill people he wanted people to confess and then go to the authorities with that info phee wants justice new wants revenge they should all go to prison for a long time except for phee white and new who should get mental health help instead because while he killed people he didnt do it while in a clear state of mind anyways im hella excited to see how the series ends although i cant believe we have to wait a week 
side note the acting is so good holy shit they are doing an amazing job


i was genuinely surprised with all the hates towards phee where was that coming from sure he pushed non away when he needed him the most but like his reaction was kind of valid it mustve hurt him so bad seeing his lover had sx with other person and later find them hugging and comforting each other people seem to forget that non reassured him that theres nothing going on with the tutor non hides things from him which is understandable because he doesnt want to drag phee into this mess but phee wanted to be relied on he wouldnt mind getting involved in whatever that happened in nons life because he truly does care and love non i dont blamed him for his reactions at that time he didnt know non was already on the verge of breaking point at that time and he unknowingly pushes non further with his rejection it was sad yeah he did catch feelings for jin in the process so people might see this as betrayal towards non but then he rejected him after realizing he might actually be cheating on non but now its been three years he really just wanted to know the truth to find closure and moved on with his life phee protecting jin and wanted to save everyone whoever left was on brand of him he always has this savior complex plus he never signed up for things to escalate this much new pretty much blindsided him after the final seeing how even in his hallucinations he wanted to be with jin after everything kinda pissed me off because why would you still want to be with someone whos directly involved with nons miserable ending and this is the only thing that i would never defend him for lol i guess this shows his strong desire to move on and to start fresh other than that he was such a sweetheart really i dont think his character should warranted so much hate

omfg 

i rewatched the first few episodes the other day and went through the discussion threads here for that its so cool to see how the discussion and audience has grown so much this whole show was a risk to make but it just goes to show that a good plot and acting can draw in an audience

this episodes wow i knew it wasnt likely but i still wanted to hope that non was alive tee did a lot of stupid shit that led to this whole mess but just like non hes just a kid between dealing with his uncle and taking care of his father hes been in survival mode for a long time hes not a bad or evil person but tee has definitely forced himself to ignore red flags and refuse to feel regret in order to survive
it looks like the finale will force everyone to confront their fears i wonder who will make it out alive


i cannot wait to find how its gonna end im very impressed with dff so far


god i cant believe the final is almost here theres still so many questions left unanswered just of the top of my head
sorry in advance for how scrambled this is
what happened to tees uncle
why was the masked killer wearing crutches in some of the early scenes
who was keng talking to on the phone could it be related to perths character somehow
and whats the deal with perth anyway i dont think theyd just introduce a character like that so late in the show if he didnt have a role to play also im a crazy or does he kinda look a bit like white
then theres also the dropped axed from last episode which the camera lingered suspiciously long on and the marks on the trees
also does anyone else think we might have another white twist coming up its kind of suspicious that he just shows up immediately after non is found dead and the boils whats up with that sex work organ trade
oh and is non actually dead or could someone maybe perth have helped him fake his death
edit they also keep emphasizing how smart white is which is also kinda 


yes there was someone else in costume when they first arriaved with non there to make a movie and none of them was under a influance of drugs so who was it
i am still expecting that there will be a nine person in the house when poor got impaled there was someone who cut his arm and hide a knife inside the house both tan and phee were bussy so it cant be them also i dont think that in first episode the hand that touched tee crotch was a hallucination but real hand instead there is still question who mark the tree that looks like trap to make someone walk in circles like phee and jin

i also think the hand was real and not a hallucination
theres also the time fluke hallucinated that por was choking him to death it begins with the door behind them opening wind blows in and then as por is choking him fluke sees the masked killer behind them when the hallucination ends the door is still open
and right after that scene we see tannew reacting to some sound downstairs i cant remember what it was  a scream a think its also possible that he might have been hallucinating it then out of newtans field of vision we see the masked killer run past the camera
another thing ive been thinking about the bathroom hallucination with top for one thing the masked killer is using crutches  a detail that would be very strange for top to hallucinate then theres the loud breathing from the masked killer at first i didnt think much of it but what if the masked killer is wearing some kind of gas mask underneath that would shield him from tannews wacky cigarette conception later also theres a lot of smoke behind him as he enters the room

another great ep love tees backstory you really get an understanding of why he did everything he did and i love how he suffered lol and how non never forgave him and he is still living with all this guilt even after tee busted his ass trying to save nons life put himself in front of his uncles guns and goons got a part time job to give all his money to non checked on him at teh club defended him to customers got his own pay docked for nons mistakes etc like you really got a sense that tee was trying to atone even as he was telling the story back to the guys he never defended himself or tried to paint himself out to be like well i tried and portopetc was worse so i really buy his guilt and his attempt at atonement also the actor did an amazing job im convinced hes the best actor in the cast sans barcode
love manic pixie dream twink white walking into tees life and giving him hope and humanity and light again love that white seemed interested the second tee stood up and was confirmed tall lmao same i am still rooting for whiteperthnon revenge of the twinks who also took down uncle in the background plot but i doubt itll happen
im trying to mitigate my expectations by telling myself next ep is just going to be all of them having their own guilt hallucinations then the narrative will forgive them new will be punished for his wanting vengence and pheejin will live happily ever after but im dreading it new sweetie i am still rooting for blood too
i am so unsatisfied that jin is just going to coast through a punishment for what he did he doesnt even seem that guilty that he posted the tape its like he really believes his excuse that he told phee that he was mad at non for nons boyfriends sake which is such bullshit this ep did such a good job of showing tees regret and even had por of all people point out that the tutor was pure evil for preying on a student  the narrative knows that the kengnon situation was predatory and awful so why wont it properly punish jin there have been no moves made to see his attempt at redemption or penance its driving me nuts i want to see some bone shaking guilt crying screaming that we got with tee and some action for once on jins part alas i fear main ship plot armor really will protect jin and hell just get the guy phee you punk ass traitor and move on with his life ugh still excited for the last ep tho


the reason why you dont see any guilt from jin is because he doesnt actually feel guilty yea he doesnt like that he played a part in nons death but he thinks what he did isnt as bad as what tee did which is funny i think with this eps i can kinda see tee in a better light i still dont like him and think hes a bad guy but its clear to me that what he did wasnt something he did to hurt non in particular what tee did to non couldve happen to anyone even white if the time was different jin on the other hand made nons life worse on purpose what he did was targeted and would not have happened to anyone else we can tell all of this by how he hes been reacting to all of this info coming out when phee tells him whats really going on he yells at phee as if he an innocent bystander and then when he confess about what he did he makes it seem like it was a small thing notice how when everyone finds out that non is dead everyone is reacting is some way and jin is just unconcerned no anger no sadness just worried about himself even white who didnt know non from what we know felt something for non but jin hes just concerned about himself imo im ok with whatever happens as long as jin gets his punishment all the purely evil black and white characters have been killed except for him im not a big fan of him getting away with everything while people whove done less have gotten worst outcomes


if por of all people pointed out the truth about keng its a little odd that the writers wouldnt have a nice guy like jin showing any guilt or remorse over his actions he admits to having filmed the video but he doesnt really seem sorry about it which contrasts against tee who tries to help non multiple times this episode out of his own guilt im holding onto a shred of hope that jin actually helps non in some way theres a couple shots where only jins reflection is visible hinting that he might be lying about something but that doesnt explain why hes moving to america he also says non must really love keng  does he still believe non isnt a victim of grooming its honestly bizarre to see tee silently shedding tears when non confronts him while jin appears to be mostly unaffected and hasnt cried for anyone but his own broken heart at this point i cant tell if the show is going to rebuke jin for his actions if hes still part of some unknown plot or its discreetly endorsing the lack of consequences for his behavior


if their intention is for jin to come out of this show as the main pair final boy hero then they really did not think his writing through they should have never had him playing entitled nice guy if they never intended to explore his guilt agreed so much on your comment


the last non scene was so depressing i liked how non talked to tee poor boy till the end he believed he didnt have anyone in his corner


ghasedakx6


i cant wait till next week i bet all our theories were wrong and it will be a simple ending i just want a good ending not a happy ending


bocs cinematography
i dont think a happy ending was ever in the cards the writers even said it wasnt a romance i saw someone on twitter say that this is a dead dove dont eat show that people are trying to shoehorn into a romance


i just dont want any pheejin ship affecting the ending i feel maybe they want to promote them as the it couple for later project and want to emphasis on them
but i believe in the production

you betta clock

so por ended up being the voice of reason by calling keng evil i didnt see that coming phee turning the gun on tannew was predictable tannew not giving a damn was the episode highlight i dont care about your fcking ethics then he had plan b it turned out he lied to phee about marking the laced ones with an x what is the plan now though next week they seem to be living out their worst fears phee being responsible for nons death jin either seeing kengnon again or himself being filmed tee loosing white
i have no idea how its going to end but white must survive imagine just stumbling into this mess of a friend group the teewhite scenes were cute but tee is still an asshole if he hurts white like the preview suggests i will riot

i hope tee and jin gets their due punishment for real

ngl kinda procrastinated on this bc its the 2nd to last ep and i dont want this show to end but i gotta find out how white fits into this whole puzzle and whether phee will succumb to the drug new has been fucking around with and whos gonna be next on deaths list
ya know for someone surrounded by gang activity who concocted a somewhat elaborate scheme to save tops ass and fulfill his criminal uncles demands tee is pretty damn naive ma boy you yourself threatened non w selling his organs if he ratted you out to the cops you had to know that this wouldnt be an idle threat coming from your uncle right and iirc your uncle never actually promised that hed let non live in the first place what the fuck else did you expect to happen non even calls him out on it baffled why tee would send him to die only to save him at the last second and why hed put non through all this just bc he didnt want him in their friend group
at first when non is railing at tee i thought barcodes delivery was weird and i couldnt tell if he was laughing or crying or what and then i realized towards the end that it was both it was a mocking derisive laugh mixed with crying and all overlaid w wheezing bc hes been beaten so badly that he cant actually get enough air to properly scream at tee barcode the actor youre growing up to be is such a relief thai bl needs more talent like you
love how everyone else is also calling tee out on his hypocrisy even nameless gang twink
so has tee been skipping school to work more to help non w his debt i would see this as more of a redemption if he hadnt had a million opportunities to get non out of this previously hold up so they all know that tee drugged nonwhy tf are they still considering tee a friend and trusting him why is he still in their group long after non is considered gone for good like do none of them know about tees connection to shady characters i get that at this point por and jin still dont know that non was framed for the camera breaking nor do they know that tee was the one who got non to do the horse accounts to get the money for it but they have to suspect something right
i dont quite understand how much time is passing here cus non is still pretty banged up but it seems like tees pretty much dropped out of school to work eeeesh what if nons just continuing to be beaten ugh i dont care of theres enough baht in that envelope to make kinn blush it doesnt make up for what youd done to the totally innocent kid for absolutely no fuckin reason
see i say that then they immediately show us how tees been unfairly parentified and the way that forced him into his uncles claws i justno it doesnt make what hes done to non excusable not in any sort of way whatsoever i know people in real life who were forced into some pretty awful situations and had to grow up fast like that but they still didnt frame a kid they barely knew and pull that kid into an even worse situation than their own but i will say that from what we now know that tee has been given very few choices in life and has not been set up to be in a position where he can afford to be generous or empathetic hes in survival mode which is what initiated his decision to use the broken camera to get non into the horse account scam in the first place its not an excuse but it is somewhat of an explanation tho i am a little confused about whats actually wrong w his dad it has to be some sort of mental illness or maybe a brain injury thats left him disabled cus if he were a drunk i dont think tee would be going through so much just to keep him safe
hold up hold up they all knew that non was working for tees uncle to repay his debt from the money he took from the horse accounts ok i feel dumb i thought they knew nothing about it and were just blindly trusting tee and thought non had run away or something but do they know that tee got non into the money laundering in the first place or do they just think that non got himself into a mess and tee is using his connections to help him out im confused about who knows what at this point tho admittedly im probably overthinking it lol
side note what the actual fuck happened to keng was he already sold off to organ harvesters before tee intervened for non is the picture of him leaving w non fake or is that not actually keng
man the whiplash i just had w por first hes a complete asshole for trying to deflect blame away from himself bc if hed just owned up to not taking care of his precious camera like he should have in the first place none of this would have happened he left it in an unlocked classroom with his idiot friends what the fuck did he expect to happen but then he is the only one of the bunch who calls out keng for the predator that he is and how fucked up it is that non is running off w him
huh tee went looking for non at the casino so he must know that the photo is faked to draw media attention away from the uncle i was wondering about that
well fuck did he just succumb to internal bleeding or something i wanna feel more about this but i just cant help feeling like non isnt actually dead yet but if he isnt that begs the question of how hed fake it convincingly to the uncle who im sure has seen more than his fair share of dead bodies
oh the note lookim not ruling out the possibility that non faked his death i mean his own brother conned an entire school and magically became walter white just to make his brothers bullies confess their sins the show is not immune to wild swings but whether its fake or not nons death truly hit me with that absolutely soul crushing note which thankfully confirmed that it had only been a couple weeks burning through the air
of course as soon as tee tells himself he doesnt deserve to be happy the perfect boy just struts right into his life the world is truly not fair sometimes to be totally fair he does resist whites pursuit for seemingly quite a while butso is white truly just an innocent bystander who fell for the grumpy tall dude at his local internet cafe huh i dont know how to feel about that on the one hand it would be pretty contrived for him to also have some elaborate plan of his own or something and not great pacing to wait to introduce it so late in the game its much more realistic to have at least 1 person whos just a pureish soul so they can be the audience surrogate to feel the real horror of the situation on the other it still feels kinda wrong to have him be totally innocent in such a convoluted story he might be the most unlucky of the bunch
its so odd but kind of brilliant to see such a different but similarly framed meetcute love story origins between tee and white as we saw for phee and non its also fascinating to see a glimpse of how if tee hadnt been in such a dire life situation if he hadnt been having to get his hands dirty to survive for so long how he could have turned out so much more like phee protective nurturing a little prone to jealousy would do anything for the boy they love
i still have questions like how did tee take care of his dad when he went to college and if he quit working for his uncle entirely and got by w part time jobs and if so why didnt he do that a helluva lot sooner i hate the whole innocent bambi finally convinced me to clean my life up trope but its good to have at least most of the truth out there finally tho i will say phee and new should probably be reacting more strongly to the confirmation that non is dead i get that theyve had like 3 years now to come to terms w it and from their little murder board they came up with id wager they put at least some of the pieces together before even getting to the house but still i knew phee wasnt going to actually shoot anyone but i dont understand why he just let new toke up on his murder weed like that
for the finale it looks like were gonna get a lot of hallucination scenes so itll be interesting to parse out whats real and whats not of course my biggest question is whether nons really dead or not which the preview isnt helping bc a seemingly alive non is jumping off a building oh theory so the bully gang mostly has an aversion to non helping w their movie and call him greasy and just generally imply that hes very much not popular at their school we know that hed been taking medication and that when he made the boyfriend proposal phee mentioned that non had been through hard times and weve also seen that he may not be the most mentally stable person so id already theorized that perhaps non had a previous mental health crisis that was in public or knowledge of it got spread around school maybe a bipolar manic episode or suicide attempt or severe panic attach and that is why hed gained a reputation as a weirdo at school and been largely ostracized by his parents and classmates what if that scene in the preview is a flashback to that incident or maybe a hallucination by phee where he imagines he was there to stop phee and how different both of their lives would have been hmmm perhaps farfetched but who knows as for the fates of the rest i genuinely have no clue and thats so exciting its hard to imagine any of them moving on from this horrorfest of a weekend not just emotionally but literally people died someones gonna have to go to prison for that unless new somehow also dies and when the authorities come they just lay all the blame on him which wouldnt even entirely be a lie

me when my dff theory is right


my frustration with jin continues to rise i bet he justified his recording of non with tee telling them about non and tutor


bocs cinematography
jin and fluke are cut from the same cloth  bystanders whereas jin tried to play the good guy and fluke just stood back completely passive but i feel like we are going to be thrown a curveball with jins character

bocs cinematography
taking a ffvii rebirth break to focus on my other hyperfixation
i really really hope that this show has an ending thats satisfying it doesnt have to be happy or even what i expect but i hope its at least satisfying honestly though i dont even know what i expect for an ending thats whats so good about this show so far


im confused the preview for next week shows his still alive or is phee hallucinating

i think hes just hallucinating but why did non have the blood on his face hmmmmm


also what was it with the bathroom scene in the preview they have jin witnessing everyones sex scene lol

poor jin


but hallucinating all the way back to the uncle place when we all were at the vacation home it was the same area non and tee had that brief conversation ugh they really shouldnt have given us that preview if we already saw him dead boo tomatoes potatoes 

wow the drugs must be really strong or he really is alive well see 

i dont want it to end  its such a great show wow perth was slaying this episode

anyone knows what this letter says


it was shown in the ep it says im gonna get out of this place im not a loser tee smoking and burning the paper scene

good episode but some things still dont make sense
one of them is why jin keeps seeing a bloody keng when he is hallucinating according to the show all he knows is that keng ran away with non so something is missing there
and watching the first episode there should be a 9th character wearing the mask if non is dead then who could that be in the first episode when por was lured out and got poked plus slashed with a knife both phee and tannew where in the house with others
oh well next week we should get all the full picture hoping for a good ending where everything clicks

bocs cinematography
okay crazy theory i have to get out of my brain so i can sleep its the last week we can have crazy theories about whats going to happen so indulge me
 in one of the lives jet started rambling about top and he started saying something about tops family life and everyone was like bitch are you just spoiling what if tops dad is one of uncle joes goons so tops relationship with tee this whole time has been a mirror of joe and the goons so what if he knows what happened to nons body they never zipped up the body bag so im being delulu that non is still alive i think that top still has a larger role to play here


yo wtf tee am i supposed to feel sorry or what
i hope new succeeds in killing everyone   lbh they all deserve it for several reasons omg
poor white tho
anyways that boy at the casino is the possible new partner of bible right hes gorgeous  im already in love 


bocs cinematography
i think it will probably be bas that will be bibles new partner but i actually really love the idea of perth and bible perth has a sassy energy that pairs well with bibles more quiet energy  that dynamic reminds me a bit of billybabe


exactly i honestly would need time for a biblebas pairing while i can absolutely envision bibleperth 
am i the only one who thinks non isnt dead the note he left behind doesnt seem like a suicide note to me if anything i took it as a hint that he will do anything to get out of this place including faking his death i think perths character helped him do this and got him somewhere safer i just refuse to believe that non would die and that the scene would feel so anticlimactic without us seeing anything happen when non is in the centre of every event that takes place i am placing my bets on him making his appearance in the final ep next week
as to tee i can say that i definitely understand him much better now of course just because his life is shitty he didnt have the excuse to ruin nons but at least i saw why he became the way he was and while yes he did the bare minimum by trying to help non after putting him in this situation it made me sympathize with him more than i could with anyone else of the friend group
so curious to see what will happen the next episode


i also dont believe hes dead the deaths weve seen in this show have all been tied to important aspects of each characters story  from por dying surrounded by his familys wealth to top losing his own free will to the corrupt criminal justice system oppressing people living in poverty like nons parents if he really had died i dont think the show would have just shown him being manhandled into a body bag we dont know what perth or keng were doing during this episode so i think its likely perth and maybe a few other people like the journalists working to bring down uncle joe helped him fake his death and escape



this was a great episode we get a little bit of humanization from everybody even por we get an inside look into tees home life and its tough to watch no kid should have to face what hes going through we dont know how long hes been dealing with it but his struggles remind me of young people who resort to illegal means like dealing drugs to provide for their families and kids who have to look after their own parents and younger siblings
there have been bls in the past that tackled classism but this show integrates commentary on class and morality in a way that doesnt necessarily romanticize it or tug on your heartstrings none of them radiate babygirl energy except white tees character poses an important question can a person make ethical choices in a bad environment with so few options how much does the ability to be morally good and empathetic depend on ones socioeconomic status for those living at and below the poverty line survival and meeting basic needs often takes precedence over larger social issues with moral implications like climate change and foreign conflicts tee and phee share a lot of similarities with scenes in the neon pinklit room and the gardenlake paralleling their roles as protectors phee risks himself and his family to help non with his debt and doesnt hesitate to treat jins injuries and tee shields white with his body takes on an extra job for non and assumes the role of caretaker for his father but while phee has a supportive parent and a comfortable home life tees home life is a mess hes in survival mode emulating the actions of the adults that raised him violence bluster and coercion like an animal hiding their wounds he has a stoic demeanor and doesnt expose his vulnerabilities towards his friends wearing a poker face both at the casino and at school his love for white turns into his salvation  he becomes a more open carefree person that he might have been in a better environment
however tee seems disgusted by non in a way that goes beyond his status as an outsider and avoids him like the plague in the flashbacks i think its possible that he sees his own lowness reflected in him and instead of offering solidarity his internalized stigma and singleminded focus on survival has him working against non and scamming the poor kid instead of richer and dumber targets like por and top this dynamic reflects the phenomenon of lateral violence where marginalized communities harm each other instead of unifying against the institutions and the people in power that subjugated them like por and tees uncle but tee preys on non and sabotages him perpetuating the cycle of poverty and oppression
its interesting that perth and tan deliver opposing beliefs about acting in selfinterest if it comes down to it worry only about yourself and we need to stick together to survive this show was billed as a slasher but it seems to be more like a psychological horror story exploring what obligations people have to help each other if any and the responsibilities that systems and institutions have to serve the people that exist within them each character represents a distinct point on the socioeconomic and moral spectrum por represents the wealthy exploiting and stealing peoples work top is a loudmouthed sycophant trying to stay in pors good graces fluke is a passive complicit bystander hungry to join the ranks of the rich and influential jin while conscientious rarely translates his instincts into tangible action and nons family faces severe financial hardship forced to choose between paying for basic necessities or their eldest sons tuition which leads to the mistreatment and neglect of their younger son in this story the rich just seem to be inexplicably awful users and exploiters tees uncle refuses to cover his brother or brotherinlaws care and pors father capitalizes on the success of his sons film to boost his own reputation his mother disparages nons broken family with a smile
if next week is the finale this show almost feels too short for all the plot threads that are still left hanging who are the masked killers does fluke get into medical school does the pheejin ship sail does new get the mental help he needs how can anybody escape the house without a driver


hoeing for boeing
at this point a good ending would not not be all of them dead maybe white surviving but im sure theyll be able to stick him with something in the last episode too

i am still expecting that there will be a nine person in the house when poor got impaled there was someone who cut his arm and hide a knife inside the house both tan and phee were bussy so it cant be them also i dont think that in first episode the hand that touched tee crotch was a hallucination but real hand instead there is still question who mark the tree that looks like trap to make someone walk in circle like phee and jin i can imagine that in the last minute of the final episode when final girl will think that he is safe there came a plot twist that there always been somone else who want reveange


i feel bad for tee but i cant forgive him for what he did non is dead and his family he ruined all the 4but i also have my doubts non is alive i guess and that note where he says ill get out of here im not loser is sus maybe hes pretending to be dead or ate that medicine from pit babe where charlie did not breathe for 2 hrs and is alive  i dont know im delusional  next ep looks interesting and once again barcode nailed it i also like the guy playing tee hes talented for sure and teewhite chemistry wow im impressed 


after this mess this episode was i just have one question who killed tees uncle it was just accidental or a normal death the newspaper said he was found dead in strange circumstances
i find weird just to say he is dead if its not related to the plot


i honestly love how this episode highlighted how no one in this show is truly good or truly bad people make bad decisions or have bad circumstances but its not who they are theyre all awful and all deserve sympathy apart from por


everybody is guiltywhite the only one caught in the crossfirehope you survive this

i am a the only one who think that in according to prewiew tan will probablly drug them all and make them under the influence of drugs and visions of non to hunt each other just like he did to top in prewiew that was leaked last week we can see some of them in the forest when they have a halucination of non and non ask phee if he really want to protect him

you know the way people say if the person didnt die on screen then they might not actually be dead and that theres a possibility they might come back this is how i felt before episode 11 i didnt really believe non was dead because we didnt see him die
but if this show has taught me anything its that they dont show us new characters for no reason a lot of things are deeper than they seem and theres a lot more nuance to the characters we consider to be villains or antagonists now that im finished rambling  this statement might bite me in the ass later but a part of me still doesnt think non is dead
