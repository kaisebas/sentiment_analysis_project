ugh poor non going through so much abuse  barcodes acting is really great though i hope well continue to see more of him in the next few episodes before jumping back to the present
that said
tacode tacode tacodeeeeeee 
pheejin is probably going to be endgame since were assuming non is deadmissing forever but man my inner macauchay from kp has reawakened and is absolutely vibrating at the pheenon were getting next episode



ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
my ghost ship tabarcode is actually sailing truly i have never been so lucky
i was cackling when the boys were sitting at the table at school and jin was just casually watching kinnporsche
tee and top are garbage do we know what the favor was that tee asked of him or is that still to be revealed still v excited for top to die
now that we know phi is the secret boyfriend i wonder if the brother will be making an appearance perhaps tan ive been wondering how hes going to fit into all this especially since hes very much taking initiative in the present day to find out what happened to non
based on the preview it looks like the shady tutor is finally making his move my assumption is that non tells him that he needs money to pay back the customer and the shady tutor offers it in exchange for sleeping with him because hes gross also excited to learn who gets to kill him


omg if tan is the brother i will actually like scream i think thats honestly such a good answer to so many of my questions but idk because this series is always making me shocked
i agree so much that tee is garbage but at least we got his backstory of why hes an asshole i wonder what shit top has gone through to excuse his actions they probably wont be
if white is with tee for real and isnt a part of the revenge i sincerely hope he dumps tees ass so hard he should get with tan frfr cuz hes the only not trash and single guy


bocs cinematography
not sure but top definitely knew about the whole plot because of his 3 looking smirk when the others were asking if they got the letters about the bank accounts what letter what letter im totally innocent nothing


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
im changing my mind i think white is nons brother we dont know for sure he was older and it would make sense that he attached himself to tee since we know tee was the main person who fucked non over
i still dont know who tan is though

there are strong hints that tan is the brother considering he is asking the most questions 


i honestly think white is nons brother


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
yeah ive since changed my mind to white as the brother


i will officially be there for at least the next week the tear  both their expressions  the gentle hold of phee and the grasp of non  their hands 
i am absolutely feral


ngl it one of the most beautiful pictures ive ever seen so intimate



yo the pheejin arc gonna hit soo different now also the visceral rage i feel every time the boys disrespect non means that they are doing a good job lmao


i am just so freaking happy that some of my theories got proven right i love this feeling  i am so so so excited for the next episode it really looks like the teacher is giving non money in exchange for his life what would prove the theory that hes part of the cult and they indeed sacrifice people  i agree with the people who like couples that arent fixed and have them mixed up but stilli kinda feel sad and betrayed for jin  at first i thought tan would be  and i think that wouldve been also pretty exciting but it makes sense that its phee  since hes somehow like the main main character
i still dont exactly get why por apologized for taking money from non maybe because he wanted money from him at all because so far he obviously didnt steal from him like i first assumed
and im guilty i laughed at nons shirt im sick of everything is such a mood
and i loved how jin is casually watching kinnporsche at school 
ah its really really exciting and thrilling i cant wait to get over all these flashbacks and come back to the present 


not them singing porchays song when filming their short too  that made me snort so badly so many easter eggs
i really like that teachers theory but then is he now dead  and why would only jin see him  or is he part of the revenge team 
also about por thats very interesting did por inquire about what happened hence the newspaper about tees uncle  did whatever happened to non made him want to know what truly happened  and now that consequences are facing him he regrets what for him was the trigger to all this 

which song is it i was about to ask because i didnt know the song but i assumed it was an easter egg
por told us in the beginning that the people who make the sacrifice for the cult also kill themselves at the end so maybe the teacher sacrificed non and also killed himself
about por i dont know it felt like he regrets what happened back then since he apologized for it and said i shouldnt have taken the money from you but in the other hand before he was very chilled with tee while they were talking when they got the camera upstairs in the room tee said what if they find out and he was like yeah whatever its over why should they care or something like that


its the song from kinnporsche that porchay barcodes character writes for kim his love interest  its this song is called you barcode has two songs at the moment no more dreams and this one huhu
damn that would be gruesome but then where does jin go in here 
yeah but por being and egoistical spoiled boy with too high expectations that destroyed him as a person maybe only properly reflected while half dead on his couch 

yeah thats what i meant regarding por 
thank you for the song i havent watched kp yet so thanks for the spoilerfree description d
mhhhh i dont know i doubt that non told jin about his plan  its hard to spin further because i dont know how much jin knows

bruh i just finished the episode and i actually screamed at the last scene and the preview like wtf phee is nons secret  on the phone 
im shocked i tell you absolutely shocked and how do phee  jin end up fwb when they both seemed to be crushing on non 
im so sad for non and i want to put tee on the list next fr


i though is that phee wants revenge for what they did to his boyfriend


oh my god i am so ready for more
as someone who wants less established closed couples of actors i love the perspectives
damn i dont know what i am allowed to discuss here lets jump
so phee is there for revenge probably got tan with him on it as planned beforehand kudos to people that has this on their theories 
they were friend with benefits and then boyfriends  or is that just phees line but its actually said to jin 
barcodes acting daaamn dude
sammon really looked at him and was like people love you and you cry well lets traumatise you so much as she should
also i have to give it to us he does not look one year older than the rest of the group great acting
tees character is incredible so stuck in a bad place but no will to go out can he  probably not but he doesnt even try anymore really looking forward to how white enters the picture
we still havent seen non strangling top so they will go back in the woods later how  why 
tas arrival  i loved it even with the spoilers i already had i was so ready
so many layers of story
so non is someone with a mental sickness so many pills a disappointment compared to his big brother a source of dispute between his parents probably both for his mental sickness and his upbringing damn what a life
and damn do a lot of people have the hots for that boy as they should he is glorious

im so invested in this the layers to all of this unfolding is just  im so intrigued in seeing how tf phee plays into everything that happened in the woods 


there are layers and so many details did you catch that the news channel is called boc for beoncloud  
i want more this is really so much more than just a slasher serie
i am imagining exaggeratedly of course then pitching the idea to ta  so dude youre gonna be steamy with copper of course but also in love and steamy maybe  i kinda hope with barcode also you will violently avenge him in blood with any weapons of your choice
we dont really know but phee has to be around for a reason i really hope non is around too
i have to go back to my analysis thread and see we came to happen and what is still pending 


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i liked that jin was watching kinnporsche on his tablet i see you vegas you cant get past me

at least can we be a couple is something he says safe to non since we see his mouth moving to the words


yeah in between i went to rewatch the last scene and the first part of the preview at least 20 times and realised that 
as much as i did not like macauporchay damn am i invested in pheenon such a word play on the classic we are phi nong pheenonjin and any variation of that


throuple yas lol too bad this isnt one of those series where non went and got plastic surgery and became white lol


i dont know why the plastic surgery doesnt appeal to me
now the throuple though thats something i can get 1000 behind


i meant in some revenge series people may get plastic surgery or lose a lot of weight maybe i watched too many lakorns


yeah i heard that type of theory with phee being non then tan or white being non  i dont watch lakorns  that may explain why the idea is so alien to me


this series is seriously fun it makes everyone guess we are all going to be doing this


yeah its crazy we have no script no book to be based on and anything can happen with these guys
sherlock homlsing to the extreme 
i never went second by second to analyse trailers for bl before that
this is really compelling like its excellent storytelling on top of which its a healthy bl no homophobia they are in simple relationships its even fun the homosexuality is the simplest part of the plot 


pretty much the extremes are the adults from parents both rich and poor as well as those mafia scammer pyramid schemers to the possibly pervy culty kinda hot teacher
i hope they write a novel that uses the drama and gives us different povs and extras that fill in time gaps that theres not enough time for the series to use since its only 12 episodes


yeah its not a surprise that pheenon knew each other since the thai nicknames always have a connection if they are used in this way the question was only if they are siblings or lover  i would have loved if tan was  but as i said in another comment it makes sense that its phee also given the fact that hes something like the main main character kinda leader of the group etc


so i went back to watch nomoredream mv because of course i am obsessed and hyper fixating
maybe the second person in the mv is ta there is a faint trace of his tattoo on a finger in one pictures
also the preview show is phee and non next to a body of water in the mv its phee and jin that are near a very similar body of water jin is often show a with stripes and he appears in clip behind barcode singing multiple times phee is holding a camera these are mixed with jinnon shots
they are muddying the trail so much my dudes
and someone holding a nice picture of teeportopflukejin and non after filming non is holding the terror mask so its the part we are still missing where non strangles top and plays the bad guy

do you mean this httpsxcommintyqrtstatus1749809323960889474s20



yup  i dont have x its too toxic for me to bear so i missed this  thank you dont you think the place is similar to the one phee and non cuddle in in the preview for next week 

i didnt watch the mv so its hard to say but yeah could be and i dont use x often someone in mdl linked the theories of the person and i find them interesting so i just come back to read their stuff 

this show is amazing i dont think theres been a bl before where the main couple got turned upside down and im sat like even if it ends as pheejin now they have to work for it oh god im so excited


the revenge plot is clearer now pheenon id like to know morejin is innocent and kind i dont get any malice and bully vibes from himi think he likes nontee is just a criminal dont care about his reasonstop is an ahole who thinks only of himselffluke is aware but does nothingpor is a spoiled brat who runs to mommywill see how all these unfolds

that bullying is brutal poor non
but i loved that jin was watching kinnporsche on his break and tabarcode im excited 
its really well done big thumbs up to the cinematographer screenwriter and director 



bocs cinematography
damn this show is fucking incredible there is so many threads barcodes acting was phenomenal this episode no wonder everyone is in love with him i loved the way that they showed how jin was falling for non  how everything was fading away for him except non and his voice and he was just pulled to him like a magnet professor is giving big red flags why was he targetted as an effigy of leaves what did you do keng
we see that phee isnt what he seems but i still think neither is white he saw himself covered in boils and there is the supernatural element im still wondering if hes secretly evil tee is a very interesting character hes absolutely doing dick move shit but hes caught in a tough spot too so hes not good but hes not wholly bad either i need to know how this whole thing comes together because its so damn interesting
also por and his entire family can fucking die oh wait  por already did hahahahaha


we think alike here  also love your flair
i really dont know where to stand with keng but 2j acting is impressive i barely recognise him and he goes that line between creepy and caring with mastery i am a teacher myself and he makes my head spin
white hides something thats what i think too but i wonder how he fits in the rest trailers have me the feeling that he targeted tee and was the one to pursue him romantically
they give us crumb by crumb thats really masterful


bocs cinematography
at first i thought tees line in the first episode about you said youd behave if you came was tee being controlling but honestly what if it was to keep white in line we already know that tee associates with bad people  maybe white is involved with that part of his life somehow
if white is some evil janta cult acolyte i will be gagged gooped and gooned


maybe since white came unto tee tee sees him as a flirt and see any interactions he has as flirty  dunno

are you implying that white is not as pure as he seems interesting 


i definitely think he is not if not simply because every character we saw is multidimensional and i dont really see the author being like everyone has a back story and multiple layers and is grey or plain black except you my special snowflake cinnamon role who did nothing wrong 

white  non both fall into this box for me which is why im hoping the show lends more nuance to them like at least jin has the depth of being friends with questionable characters and going along with the whole scheme etc but so far white and non are presented as completely innocent


in fairness non is the victim whose desperately lonely and in need of friends so the pure part we see is still nuanced in his pain and becomes layered in becoming presumably the psycho murderer

white always striked me as such an interesting character i really need to see white and tees backstory to make some proper judgement
but right now i think him tan and phee are definitely working on something together because i remember when the three of them plus jin were talking and idk would you get along with your friends boyfriends that well
i think rn my guess is that white has something to do with the revenge so im just rly curious to see whether hes with tee for his plan or he got together before then learnt the truth about him still the way he didnt question anything about tees uncle when fluke asked him rly got me thinking def not a normal relationship

i am not sure for me the teacher is alone involved in the cult where on the other hand we have phee tan and white together
we know nons parents have money problems we also know that non isnt really interested in staying alive the teacher in the preview offers him money in exchange for his life at least that is what it sounds like so my theory is the teacher gives him money non takes it to help his parents and therefore gets sacrificed for the cult  which is a winwin for non since he doesnt want to live anymore and suicide doesnt seem to work since everyone is interrupting all the time  and maybe phee also keeps a closer eye on him now


i kind of agree with you but those little staring contests the teacher and non had rly put me on edge i actually thought the teacher was nons  just because of the staring do you think that tension was like because he wants to buy non or something else


i dont know the time line for phee and ji being friends with benefit but i assume phee started it after whatever happened to non i remember when they mentioned that they became friends with the gang a year after nons disappearance
so my theory is that they all had long term plan for revenge phee tan but i feel white can be the older brother or someone they know because he is so far removed from the story that his place in the story seems cruel


i knew that phee had to be the brother or the loveri wonder what this means for pheejin does he actually love him or is it just an revenge plot as suspected 


bocs cinematography
it could be both or started as revenge and turned to love im sat for this show


ive seen a theory that phee was two timing both non and jin if that happens it would be so messy 


this would make my head spin

i already feel bad for jin although it was before he met phee and i think phee and non are cute together i dont want two timing being involved 
but since there are also mysterious blurry quotes from the writers about if its really okay if they kill people and split up a couple i just expect the worst and no happy ending for anyone 

nons im sick of everything shirt  just misery upon misery dumped on him and a sketchy af teacher too ew 
so far phi jin and white i guess are in the clear will tee get a redemption arc  he has problems but dragging your classmate into it is such a dick move omg


thats some form of pyramid scheme right there these are the worse



bocs cinematography
pheephibrothernew he was the one that was the most insistent on seeing and remaking the movie
edit well nevermind lol

gladly phinong isnt just used for biological siblings 


like oppa and gege lol

more of hyung since both are guys but both of them are only used for older people so not really a perfect equivalent here 


yes hyung


wowowowow what a twist


the only thing i wonder is why that uncle bringing them food had to die by decapitation in previous episodes lol like did he do something bad


well he is acting in the movie we see him on their reels what does that mean exactly  i dont know but he is part of the stealing of nons work


oh yikes i didnt notice i thought he was innocent lol

it seems like the culprits are reenacting the movie imo

i thought that was to prevent him from helping them leave the houseforest i think hes innocent but they were going to ask him to get help



that was plot twist and poor non pheenon was fwb when they were high schoolers wownon is a silent introvert but also boldjin still seems like a good guy tho and hope tee top will get miserable ends  i dont care tee needs money for his dads medical billsthey brought in an innocent person and drove him to do what he did screw themit must be a delight for tabarcode shipper during kp era and jincopper he really is handsome and talented love this show its getting betterwith barcodes entry like his character makes the story interesting


cmon boc give us something good today 


anybody catch perth around 214 mark btw blue jacket white stripe


cause of death the heart killers 
i just realized he was there because im watching the reaction vids im gonna have to circle back to every onair i couldnt figure out how he was going to fit the plot but he was already there


i am glad i stuck with this show it is really growing on me and i definitely wasnt expecting that ending i might need to do a rewatch asi am sure i have missed loads of clues 


oh god its phee i thought he would be nons brother not the lover but i really like it
definitely he is out for blood and im loving it after what those monsters did to non they deserve hell especially tee and por well he bit the dust already 
phee told jin he wouldnt allow anything happen to him so i wonder if he is in the revenge plan or at least phee knows that like him jin loved non and its innocent
by the way tees uncle appears death at the first of the story in the present day i wonder if phee will kill him for threatening non and the same with the teacher who seems a pervert
im loving this series



another fun ep i am rooting for a pheenon revenge plot and rooting for them to get away with murder lolol barcodes misery was so good i totally relate to phee willing to kill for non because same so hype to watch all those jerks die
however i am somehow still weirdly fond of tee idgi when he was such a dick lmao maybe this is handsometall privilege in action oops i will accept it but be sad if he dies


lmao same about tee honestly i hate him so much but then i see him towering over everyone else and my moral compass disintegrates
tho loving phee being in on the whole non drama curious to see how it plays out


yes super curious also phee being especially hateful towards tee makes sense now that we have this backstory he can fake it with all of them except tee lol

this episode had me shook
when i finished kinnporsche while kimchay were just okay for me i secretly would have loved to see chaymacau and never in a million years did i think i would get it in another universe
im still team pheejin though but im going to enjoy tabarcode as much as they will give
poor non just couldnt catch a break like how on earth did things go so wrong
its a first for me to watch a horror setting and root for half the cast to die horribly rather than survive
if non is still alive and getting his revenge its por down and top and tee at least need to pay there is not a single redeemable quality in either of them
fluke and white are still a mystery though i wonder if white is clean he will end up as collateral damage for tee going down


okay so its looking more and more like this is completely planned by humans and like realistic fiction right but what about that dark hand in episode one where tee and white were making out like is that even related to the plot and who would be controlling the hand because theres no way someone was just sitting there omg if this turns into some supernatural thing i dont know if im going to be happy or upset

not him watching kinnporsche at schooli screamed
1112


so i chose the right time to start watching im suddenly not opposed to tabarcode and uhmmm yeah  im too dumb to put 11 together so ill just let the show surprise me


ok got to ep6 nothing seems crazy or unexpected tbh went back to ep1 again and phees scene with jinfor science lol and it is still one of the hottest scenes ta is really giving it his all copper is just so pretty his features are so delicate and they kiss amazing togetheryes i got sidetracked ok
so non getting bullied by all the boys who are trying to cover up the original movie footage no surprise there phee ta being nons lover ok that one is unexpected sort of in ep1 the way phee was acting i 100 thought he was nons best friend or brother or some other close person to non and was coming back under cover to find out what really happened to non or to get revenge for non
also tan when he said he would go under cover with the other side the original movie boys immediately made me think he was secretly plotting with phee and also here undercover so i guess rewatching the hot scene in ep1 between phee and jin makes me think that jin and phee were friends and were hooking up and jin knew that phee was also hooking up with non and maybe it wasnt that jin liked non maybe he was trying to see why phee liked non that triangle is interesting and by interesting i just want ta to make out with copper again tbh  i dont think barcode will make out with anyone tbh so putting all my chips on jin and phee
fluke being a selfish prick and knowing but allowing non to be blamed is onbrand with how he acted throughout no surprise top same tee same por same blah bullies are horrible and i hate them all no redemption bye off with their heads
white is a cutie eventhough binging the episodes make me find him annoying with proper dosing i like white i didnt even like the hot scenes with tee and white because from ep1 tee felt like a coward and a bully
so i only need white jin and phee to survive and non if he wants to make out with white i will take that the rest of them can all disappear honestly no redemption needed  i dont even need them to make out because their bullying immediately unhots them so no need bye bullies off with your heads the tutor teacher sammon makes me think human trafficking  maybe although why did the tutor teacher smile when non got the math question right made me think he would find him useful for gambling and counting cards otherwise why would you want a smart kid for human trafficking purposes


i havent even watched yet but the spoilers ive seen and the hints at next week honestly have me contemplating putting this show on hold until its finished and i know exactly what ive signed up for
considering that ta and copper won thc and this is supposed to be their prize im not really a fan of where this seems to be going though itd explain the lack of marketing for them as a pair it feels like a bit of a bait and switch with pheejin being pushed in the first episode only for everything to be something else entirely
again i havent watched yet but i really dont know if i even want to because the spoilers have left such a bad taste in my mouth
edit having now watched the episode im still not a fan of how they are handling the romances here which is a pity because the rest of the show is well done and layered also i said this in a comment further down but im really not a fan of how non is being centered here in a show that is the prize for thc it just feels unfair to ta and copper to have barcode  who already has a huge following  be centered in their show on top of that his character also lacks the depth that the rest of the characters have because he has no shades of grey to him so far  hes just an innocent baby victim who has done nothing wrong in theory this is fine but it has pitfalls in a show like this where you have other characters doing awful things due to the situations theyre in hopefully this changes
that being said im a tad more hopeful that this isnt just pure revenge for phee but i think i need to put my blromance hopes thoroughly on the backburner for this show and center the horror again and basically expect anythingeverything


do you need to know the endgame in advance to enjoy the show 


its more a matter of deciding whether or not i want to devote my time to something i watch shows because they make me happy or i enjoy them if im going to watch only to be sad and frustrated then i dont see the point you know like i just decided against watching last twilight for example due to spoilers i saw about how it ends i dont need that sort of disappointment
its partly my own fault for forgetting that boc does really push the boundaries of traditional bls etc i know whats typical and expected in horror i love the genre but i didnt expect some of it here because its a bl and i probably shouldnt have let my thoughts go down that path
this show could still be salvageable to me but i think the main fear i have is that itll turn out that phee is faking everything and doesnt have any feelings for jin at all which would really sour my thoughts on how the show presented them and how ta and copper have been treated
edit i dont usually complain but cmon people i dont downvote you for being excited for stuff i dislike so itd be nice if you didnt downvote me for not being happy 

i understand why you wouldnt like it but i like that boc seems to be pushing boundaries and not going the typical bl route but we have to wait  and see what they do with it for the rest of the series 

oh i know  i think im just really nervous about the possibility that theres no feelings there at all partly because some of phees actions will then not make sense if thats the case like why did he save jin in episode four
if this was a horror movie id be completely fine lol im used to this sort of thing scream anyone but its still marketed as a bl and i want my pheejin hahaha plus i really dont like love triangles or cheating and im a little nervous thats whats going on


bocs cinematography
i think the feelings are genuine the way he was in the coffin about protecting jin didnt seem fake unless hes a supreme actor personally i love that they arent doing it the typical bl route since im kind of atypical bl watcher in that my faves are the ones that are about something else besides the romance  im never really a romance first genre person and like the ones that are more just queer content than a straight up romance like moonlight chicken only friends manner of death not me this show etc
im very intrigued at how we got here maybe phee got feelings for jin because jin was the only one of that group who treated non like a human and he at first found solace in him after non disappeared dunno its a shame if you do give up the show because its so damn good but you gotta do what you gotta do its for entertainment after all

the way he was in the coffin about protecting jin didnt seem fake unless hes a supreme actor
yeeeeah whats making me nervous is that this is a tried and true trope in horror  supposedly the one person has feelings but in truth its all a lie and theyre out for revenge and will do anything for it combine that with one of the pairings wont get a happy ending and im very  about it all
i think i just need to adjust my mentality back to this is horror first and foremost and stop worrying about the bl aspect the bl aspect can be saved in fanfic but in the show im just gonna assume that phees out for revenge and nothing more that way i can be pleasantly surprised if he does have genuine feelings after all
oh one thing ill add is that partly what has me feeling so sour about this is the marketingpresentation in the context of the bl genre like in traditional horror its one thing to be sold a relationship and then have it turn out to be all a scheme in bl that feels a bit like dirty play but again boc is a company that wants to push boundaries so its probably my fault for forgetting about that in my excitement about pheejin


i get you im heavily on the pheejin train too but i love this twist  the one thing i wanted was for tabarcode scenes and im getting my wish so im excited  
i dont think phee is playing with jin in the present time otherwise his actions make no sense  he literally only thinks about this boys safety who is getting hurt a lot by the way plus i cant see jin doing anything wrong to non at this point so phee wont touch him
i think non disappears leaves phee broken hearted but hes vengeful  he uses jin to infiltrate the friend group and im sure he catches feelings but he wont take it further cause hes on a mission  
pheenon are my fav characters at this point so im excited to analyze further about their history  but i really want phee to go ballistic on everybody and we know he doesnt back away from a fight so lfg
only thing that throws me off is the damn supernatural element this part stumps me and its annoying 

if you asked me for a list tabarcode would be at the bottom lolol mostly because ta and copper won thc so tbqh part of me is really quite salty on their behalf that this has become the barcode show i adore barcode but dff is supposed to be ta and coppers show not his and he has wuju coming out so the bible fan in me is also steaming about this
i think im going to continue watching under the assumption that phee is just in this for revenge and not expect anything from pheejin it seems like the safest especially with the fact that the writer hinted at one of the pairings not getting a happy ending i just assumed itd be teewhite because you know this was supposed to be ta and coppers show

if the writers actually said that then its still a toss up who gets a happy ending imo we still dont know much about phee and white and thats probably on purpose 


i hope none of us alive so phee  non can be together happily

it was one of the writers back at the beginning talking about how he discussed with boc about what they would let him do and two of the things were whether or not he could really have one of the pairings have an unhappy ending could he really kill off x character etc etc it could all be misdirect but this latest twist has me wondering


sorry if i sounded judging i was just naively wondering by the way  not judgy at all
i really wonder because for now jin has been nothing but lovely and infatuated with non i really wonder how they will meet how they will start their relationship as friends with benefits
i personally love that we dont know where this is going in regard to coupling i love a good old love story like in kp where we knew porsche was never going away from kinn for real etc but i love that more realistically things change and the options are real people and not just challenge to overcome for main couple i started with no opinion tacopper leaves me indifferent even if their first scene was absolute fire so something like that is really interesting
anyway as i will absolutely watch the rest if you need someone to give you info without spoilers i would gladly help 


well hes playing as a side character and his role is really important they are all connected to non if non was not their the whole plot wouldnt make sense and i feel like you are annoyed that non is getting in the way of your pheejin ship when both jin and phee love non and it seems like they still have feelings for him which im happy because those three have amazing chemistry
you should go look at the theories on ticktock because a lot of people think that jin has an obsession with non a lot of people dont trust jin they are sus of him
