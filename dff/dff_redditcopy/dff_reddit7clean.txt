my heart broke for phee especially when he was crying silently during the first confrontation about non and keng phee would have walked through fire for non if only he knew about what was going on i really wanted phee to understand that non was basically groomed by keng but it would be unrealistic to expect teenager to think that far
at the same time i felt so sad for non he is back to being alone now that the only person who loved him is left i dont see what non did as cheating per se because i think non was overwhelmed but didnt want to burden phee with his problems so he basically fell into kengs arms when keng showed him the slightest bit of concern
i was also rooting for jin to stand up to his asshole friends but nah bro has no spine oh well i guess its realistic for teens to succumb to peer pressure and bully others or be a bystander
now ill just wait for phee to enact whatever master plan he has to yeet all these mofos off the face of earth


and seriously jin your first reaction upon seeing your teacher and your underage crush doing the bam bam in the ham ham is to film it rather than call the popo teenagers arent the best decision makers especially when emotional but this takes the cake

its very agetypical though hell even a lot of adults would look at this and label it just sex and that keng isnt doing anything wrong jin was wrong to record it but as an angry heartbroken teen in love i can kind of understand he wasnt thinking clearly


yes i agree and this is the impression i get so i look forward to seeing how th storyline with the leaked video proceeds as i assume they will just push it under the rug


bam bam in the ham ham
i rolled hahahahahahaha but yes jin lost all my respect this episode in the past persons were saying he is just as bad as the friends he keeps but today he proved it sigh

fujoshi
yeah im getting really tired of jin always comforting non but never actually doing anything to help him


cause of death the heart killers 
i was also rooting for jin to stand up to his asshole friends but nah bro has no spine oh well i guess its realistic for teens to succumb to peer pressure and bully others or be a bystander
definitely i cant blame them for being teenagers but i still hoped for the best and was crushed to be proven otherwise comment image

not me pausing every 2 mins  absolutely losing my mind phee has been my favorite character from the start and this ep really solidified that
i feel bad for non he was going through so many things at once and on top of that some creep ass teacher just had to come and groom him
im excited to watch how exactly phee plays into everything in the present day and how exactly his complicated relationship with jin started  next week cant come fast enough

the pheejin relationship is sort of twisted if you think about it phee seems like hes trying to find out what happened to non and it seems like during the process he falls for jin meanwhile jin was sort of the catalyst for the nonphee break up  it could be a sad ending for them  because im assuming non is dead 


cause of death the heart killers 
unless phee already knows about jin posting that clip when they reunite im kinda digging all these plot twists because it seems they were really well thought of since the beginning and they werent just writing thinking what next im so here for this series tbh

it was left vague if jin posted the clip or not it seemed like he didnt and it may be one of the other boys  i have doubts that phee and jin knew about each other prior to nons disappearancedeath they kept having near misses this episode probably on purpose when they finally tell each other the truth its gonna be a big moment in the show 


cause of death the heart killers 
definitely they didnt know each other before non disappeared but i do believe that things might still happen before we go back to the future
but its true that he uploaded the clip to that drive and that anyone might have got to it and posted it anyways he did record it and he was responsible of leaving it to the others mercy


unless phee already knows about jin posting that clip when they reunite
agreed at this point anybody could be manipulating and we do not know


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant wait for the upcoming weeks the plot is really tight


yessssssssss what i love is we know part of the future so we can answer some questions we had from there and accept some deaths as those characters are garbage


cause of death the heart killers 
i cant wait for top to bite the dust 


yesssssss i call front row seats to that demise


cause of death the heart killers 
since joffrey baratheon i havent been this invested in someones demise 


yesssssssss joffrey was the target of all my disgust during my got days i see were like minded individuals 

hun i had to pause and go eat my dinner and when it ended i was shaking what a trainwreck best watch for me in months
i 50 agree with non and the teacher i hate when people do something nice and need something in return but when non leaned him and kissed him back i was like wtffff

it took me two hours to finish watching because i had to keep pausing to process what i was seeing non should be happy and it sucks sooooooo many things keep pushing him in the direction hes going
i wish jin had a backbone when it comes to his friends ultimately im here for phee and idc what happens to everyone else
people dont act like that with their brother smh


cause of death the heart killers 
i almost let a sigh of relief when he said nong and 1 second later he was leaning in comment image


yesss i saw brothers in the subtitles and was saying oh thank the most high then he leaned in and i was like ummmmmmmm no sir


cause of death the heart killers 
i was screaming no no no no which my dog translated into i must leave the premises i sounded so disgusted


hahahahahahahahaha i hate when someone does something nice and wants something in return as you wonder if it is genuine but when non went back in for the kiss i was flabbergasted and wanted to know what is going through his mind i think he is a master manipulator or he likes the thrill i was shaking when the episode ended as i was sooo stressed


cause of death the heart killers 
he just got 300000 baht i think he thought it was the least he could do 


 im pissed because he should have told his boyfriend first and then see how that works out but kiss and sex with your teacher out of nowhere makes me question his intentions


cause of death the heart killers 
teenagers not always make the best decisions 


neither do many adults


cause of death the heart killers 
true that 


same


keng i see you as a brother
me aww thats great non definitely could use someone like that and
keng kisses non
me facepalm nevermind pretend i didnt say anything
seriously what kind of relationship does keng have with his brothers d

this is honestly one of the best bl ive seen in a while i was turned off by the horror premise but stuck with it and now its definitely in the running for one of my favorite bl ever the one thing i really appreciate about this show is how intricately written it is every single character has good believable motivations for their actions that range across the morality spectrum and you find yourself vacillating between how you feel about characters from one episode to the next i love it sammon and the rest of the writing team did that also as spineless as he is fluke is the only character im really behind excluding non and phee of course


cause of death the heart killers 
yep all of this it really is captivating and fore people that were complaining about the uneveness of kps story this one is keeping it tight im in awe


its definitely in the running for one of my favorite bl ever
the episode literally left me shaking the last time i had this feeling was watching shadow and to sir with love i am hooked and genuinely surprised as i did not expect it


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
oh jin



ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
upon reevaluation though it doesnt seem like he sent it before the laptop died i wonder if this was a misdirect if he put it on a shared drive or something that the other group members could see its super plausible that one of them was the one that did it
honestly though even if jin wasnt the one to send it nons life was basically ruined by jin having a crush on him jin brought him into the group which set off the money problems is convincing him to stay to finish the film etc
poor phee  also i had to pause about 1 minute in because excuse me papa phee who is he he is an absolute snack
the tutor is the worst and im glad he will apparently die painfully based on the bloody ghost vision they saw in the previous episode


yesssssssssssssssssssssss exactly my feelings but i guess he is the perfect representation of show me your friends and i tell you who you are sigh

poor non what else are they gonna put this poor kid through ffs
actually poor phee 
but still poor non hes only doing this stuff because he feels like he has no other choice


bocs cinematography
non has been made so desperate by everything around him that hes making bad decisions ie lying to phee about the money and about keng preying on him phee would have moved the world to help non which is the saddest part

one of my youtubers said she thinks non is a master manipulator and i am inclined to agreee as i am wondering if he is using his pitiful attitude to get his way secretly


he is manipulating whom his life is a misery one after another did he force the teacher to rape him the only reason he lied to phee was a mixture of shame and not wanting to get him involved in his miserable situation

this show has me so good with the way i was ready to abandon it last week and got sucked back in anyway 
i feel terrible for whats happening but at the same time im also thrilled at execution of some character development that i had been hoping and waiting for
we finally got two things non shifting from being purely an innocent character who has done and can do no wrong particularly in audience perception to someone who is more nuanced than that and insight into phee
i think its very likely that non has been abused or had something happen to him in the past or perhaps its just the family dynamics and what hes facing at home but either way its clear that he has a few things going on hes desperate for physical affection hes depression hes anxious he feels the need to take care of himself and not be a burden to anyone all of these drive his behaviour and make him make terrible decisions that are also completely understandable and human
also i just want to state this clearly non is not cheating he is being sexually coerced by his teacher there is a difference where he goes wrong is in lying to phee and manipulating him into second guessing his thoughts etc and it seems that hes cheated in the past and thats obviously wrong but when it comes to whats going on with keng he is clearly being manipulated and coerced
i feel so badly for phee after this episode right from the start i felt like there was more to what was going on there and that thered be an explanation for him having jin at arms length etc and i got it i feel so badly for him also im more sure than ever unless boc really does go down the stonecold killer route that his involvement with jin isnt just revenge we saw how upset he was about non and how he feels about cheating i just cant see him using sex as a weapon like okay if he used it to get close to jin in the past but again in the forest it just doesnt click for me
and my poor baby boy jin i wondered what changed him from the fairly happygolucky boy in the past to how he seems in the present and i got the answer personally i dont think that hes the one who released the recording we saw his laptop short out so at the least we know that he didnt do it deliberately theres also a scene earlier in the show where fluke talks to white tee and tan about a video being released and since we know that white and tan arent involved my money is on tee top or por having been the ones who did it theres a screenshot floating around that shows icloud drive in the sidebar so im guessing jin saved it somewhere the others could access it
also im amazed at how many layers we have going on here
we have
pheejinnon
nonkeng
non vs the bullies
the money laundering
kengs sidebar with the investigative reporter
the mystery in the past  the mystery in the present
how do white  tan fit in
who does perth play lol
and there are still so many questions we need answers to what happened to non what happened to keng how did tees uncle end up dead
is it next saturday yet


your second paragraph put my feelings into words
i did not have enough and had way too much at the same time
damn was that good


so they really looked at barcode and were like  so you did not kiss anyone during kp  yeah thats sad lets have you kiss people now 
i mean he only misses us and he pinned the whole exkp cast 
oh god these kengnon had me so uncomfortable i had to walk back and forth in my homeroom to try to disperse some awkwardness while tabarcode was unexpectedly excellent and cathartic 2jbarcode was close to incest in my brain 
also i am now going to go watch the start of the episode over and over and act as if thats the only part that aired thank you
for real now that serie is truly incredible that whole episode was great and still did not answer half the questions we have about current time i am barely coherent
shits about to go down next week 
also ta your the mvp we talk about barcodes acting and boy is our code excellent and brilliant again and again but tas acting is brilliant too he was getting there but he just entered with burnished letters my bl actors hall of fame


me before the episode  daaamn i hope that tabarcode are going to kiss
me starting the episode  holy spaghetti


i had to pause and go and take a drink of water as i was shook


i was cooking and giggling crazily my husband was like the hell happens with your pasta

boc really waited for barcode to hit 18 before rubbing their hands together and giving him all the kisses and sex whewww 
im with you im also replaying and living in the first scene in fact i wont lie i felt transported back into kp and kept imagining an au where chay hooks up with macau while heartbroken over kim


that was such a whiplash for me like i was like oh i hope baby barcode has a kissing scene he never had one guess what hahah he has sex with 2j
but phee is so much more sensitive and cute than macau who let us be honest did not really have a personality apart from being spoiled i love my phee and i love ta if i could i would send him all the kudos and the love because damn that glow up


yeah the entire scene for me was like nonuh uhno way theyll show thatnonoooonononono 
ta is definitely coming into his own in this series i actually thought his acting was a bit weak in the first couple eps since there were some scenes where i could tell he was reciting his lines vs acting them and pausing between words for dramatic effect it was more noticeable for me since i understand thai though after this ep i am a firm taphee believer and would follow him to any other series he lands


damn i envy you for understanding thai the syntaxe is so different from what i am used to i can only recognise isolated words i wish sometimes i could remove the burden of the translation it sometimes feel unfaithful

yeah thats sad lets have you kiss people now 
no to mention he was on his back getting it blown out hahahahahahahaha
in kp not even a proper kiss and now is he doing the deed like it is nothing i am shook
agreed that the first part was beautiful and that ta and barcode are doing the damn thing


cause of death the heart killers 
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
when i tell you i screamed this show is blowing my mind its going where we havent gone before with a young cast like this im shocked
like theyve been selling tacopper but boy those of us that were shipping tabarcode in kp we were served those first minutes of this episode then creepy teacher got real creepy and i screamed so loud my dog went outside thinking i was scolding him my husband came to check on me and everything non is really going the tstl path going back to those friends they bully him he knows they are only taking advantage of him i need to know whats in it for him it must not be only the movie jin what were you thinking he was all jealous and he had only a lousy attempt at kissing non what in the entitlement was that
now phee i remember we wanted him to suffer a little bit after what he seemed to have done to jin but boy i get it i totally get it he gave his heart to non and he was crushed and i suppose hes gonna learn about jin posting that clip and i ugh those are gonna be the last words hes gonna say to non right ominous
my heart this episode was everything and now we are getting non embracing wholeheartedly his villain era bring it on


oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
i was shaking after the episode ended that i had to take a walk and watch something else to calm down that was the biggest trainwreck i have watched in a while it was soooo bad and sooo good at the same time i am shocked how hooked i was


cause of death the heart killers 
thank the bl gods i left fluffy cherry magic at the end because it was so heartwrenching i just cant deal right now i also replayed the first 6 min of the episode because i was a tabarcode shipper way back when and i feel vindicated


yesssssssssssss tabarcode from kp days they gave me the life i wanted to see in kp but sadly it did not last long in this show but i am sooo excited to see how it proceeds


cause of death the heart killers 
they had only lived in ao3 fanfics but our patience was rewarded 


bocs cinematography
i was like am i reading the side couple in one of my own fanfics truly wild


cause of death the heart killers 


fujoshi
god poor non
part of me wants to say why doesnt he just get away from those bullies or why doesnt he just tell the teacher no but i also understand why it isnt that simple why should he let them make the film without him and take all the credit when hes the one who wrote it and obviously when it comes to the teacher i cant blame him for that he feels obligated because of the money and of course the fault should always fall with the creepy ass teacher in this situation because of the power imbalance
but i still feel very bad for non he cant catch a break i do not feel sympathy for jin talking about waaah i didnt mean to upload the video but like you drafted the tweet if you were a good friend you wouldnt have ever even done that taking the video i understand i thought he would use it to help non report the teacher but that wasnt the case
i wish non would just tell his friends that tee is the one behind the shady bank accounts also im curious how phee ends up getting involved with the rest of the group i appreciate these flashback episodes of course but i am also eager to get back to the present to see what will happen next in conclusion fuck all those people except non and phee poor babies 

heartbreaking how phee is trying his best but hes just too young too inexperienced for the problems non is going through
barcode killing it this week again he really mustve impressed them with his crying scene in kp ya boy is crying enough to flood the world
jin 


this is exactly why in the future phee could not commit to jin non ruined him and this is how good men turn bad


okay it makes a lot of sense that barcode had to stress so much that he was an adult making his own decisions this role is getting more and more complex and theres still more to go though i feel like next episode will be climax of his arc after which we will return to the present
the beginning montage was everything ta and barcode have consistently given us top notch aesthetics the way they fit together is unreal they were cute yet sexy truly the sweetheart romance anyone would ever want
the way it contrasts with the badwrong aesthetic of barcode and jj is a whiplash ngl i need to put a genuine apology i did think jj would be a nice wholesome teacher who just happened to be super hot but i guess no such thing
still cant believe such a show actually exists and got made and next saturday is too far away


bocs cinematography
im loving how this show is structured in three acts just an educated guess this is how its going to unfold act 1 eps 14 the present setting the scene act 2eps 58 the backstory act 3 eps 912 back to the present with the new info resolutionrevenge
also with the newbie gang of phee tan and white  supernatural stuff happened in front of phee and tan but they didnt see it but white saw himself with boils all over him which has nothing to do with any of the other supernatural stuff thus far is he tied with kent and the cult

this episode was nuts best ep so far
the pheenon relationship montage in the beginning was soo cute its clear that phee wouldve taken a bullet for non the whole red bracelet breaking in the end too ah
i cant wait for how the remaining unfolds


godddddd the first scene absolutely served in the tabarcode department now i feel spoiled and want an actual tacode series to happen  they were so soft so warm together ugh just makes me want to ignore what happened throughout the rest of the episode  boc was ready to drop barcode into all the mature scenes once he turned 18 lol
2j you are hot and i love you as a person but wow you play the creeper teacher so well i couldnt even enjoy your shirtlessness because the scene with non made me so uncomfortable non looked absolutely anxiousscared during those scenes like ugh im so sad non got groomed by this man and probably thinks he has to repay him with his body to feel like he doesnt owe him anything also side note i wonder if the ghost of keng that we see earlier in the series is because keng was investigating the boys at their set and got caught and killed by a hitman sent by tees boss based on the ep preview 
and jin i trusted you he had so many opportunities to actually help non but didnt act on them  and when he finally did something it ended up ruining non and phee he mightve not been the one to actually leak the sex tape but he was def complicit for filming it in the first place gah there better be a redemption arc for him if they want me to get behind pheejin when were back in the present 
regardless of all the drama and feelings im sooooooo pumped for the next episode this show keeps on giving in the meantime you can find me replaying the first couple of scenes over and over again pretending that its an extension of my happy macauchay fantasies 

boc was ready to drop barcode into all the mature scenes once he turned 18 lol
2j you are hot and i love you as a person but wow you play the creeper teacher so well
lmao me starting this episode man i hope barcodes comfortable enough to do a kiss scene
me by the end of it not like this 



bocs cinematography
holy fuck what an episode
 these people are all so fucking punchable por and top especially us and jet are doing a great job with just looking like smug pieces of shit im so glad that por died in agony lol
 even though tee sucks massive shits i still kinda like him where por and top are just absolutely selfish narcissists and fluke is so fucking spineless and only caring about being a doctor tee has some dimensions to him hes obviously in his life to help his father and in the present we see that while top and fluke are only out for themselves tee at least cared about white so he has the capacity to care about others and also the capacity to be a complete asshole
 well we all knew that keng was a giant predator
 jin jin jin holy fuck i did not expect that to happen it makes sense though  he is the nicest one of this group but he still hangs out with them so he definitely had the capacity to be shitty he immediately knew that hed done bad though he fucking ruined nons life with one click because he was jealous and upset which hes a teenager so it does make sense
 phee is so in love with non he would or at least would have gone through hell for him and is currently going through hell for him the way ta and barcode acted the first confrontation was so good and the way non crumpled just a little in phees arms when they hugged  if only youd just been up front about everything non phee would have helped you but now this paints phee and jin so differently than even we thought last week from week to week the perspectives are changing i cant wait to rewatch this show afterwards with all the new perspectives
 damn next week looks like non is going to lose it i cant wait to see it
this show is so goddamn good


in my villain era
i like that all the motivations make sense ever choice a character is making is based in reality of their situation im not having to do mental gymnastics to justify it


bocs cinematography
yes yes yes exactly everything makes sense  they are acting like very realistic teenagers with dumb decision making that isnt just for plot but feels like what would really happen with these mentally flawed characters when teenagers like these who have stripes of shittiness in their personality are met with emotional situations and have zero critical thinking skills this kind of stuff happens
this show is so good its so much more than just a horror show or a bl show or a psychological thriller show its everything and more


he is the nicest one of this group but he still hangs out with them so he definitely had the capacity to be shitty
yessssssssssssssssss i guess he is the perfect representation of show me your friends and i tell you who you are sigh


honeslty as much as i try to hate tee he just keeps serving i mean the dimesionality of him is honestly incredible easily one of the best thought out characters ive ever seen the way that his bullying of non caused like literally everything but still doesnt do petty things like shove non is so psychopath i love it but hate him i still wanna believe that white doesnt like him at all but bro is so hot like do i blame him if he actually does
idk im going through it rn especially after that one smirk haha i wanna know all the white theories tho the two characters who get in my brain the most xd

i just want to say one thing  boc really have gold on their hands with their actors the emotions i felt while watching this episode  from sadness to frustration to feeling sick to my stomach it all felt so raw as if i was there experiencing whatever the characters were i hardly get to feel so connected and emotionally affected by a bl series but this one is doing it for me
i dont understand why this series is so underrated  although its been gaining popularity i still think its one of those gems that deserves to be appreciated more maybe people are put off by the horror aspect of it and this is why theyre not giving it a chance but anyways i hope more and more will get to appreciate dff in the future
now about the episode i am so curious to find out exactly what the friend group did to non and i think that well be getting the answer to that question next week also i am excited for when the flashbacks are over and we are back to the present because now ill be watching with a so much more different perspective and will be seeing all the characters from different lenses the mystery is so good and this whole is there something supernatural or not thing keeps me on my toes too
another thing i cant wait to find out is whether the theories about tan being nons older brother are true or if not how did he get involved with those shitty ass friends same as white im so curious about how he ended up with all of them too i cant wait to see if phee and jin are working together and exactly how much do they know of each other and of course the main mystery  is non alive and who is the murderer
speaking of jin i am so disappointed in him first of all his first reaction when seeing non with the teacher was to pull out the phone and record then he posted said video sorry but with this he hurt non so much more than tee por and the others ever did ive been cheering for him even if it always rubbed me the wrong way how he knew how much his friends hurt non how he knows what they did for him to disappear and decides to stay with them despite it but in this ep he reached a different low unless it turns out he wasnt the one who posted the video i wont be rooting for him and phee

wow what an episode people making bad decisions left and right and it just snowballed at the end 

omgggg barcode and ta were such babies in kinnporsche and now theyre all grown up and soo talented 
oh my god and i thought the bullying couldnt be worse i
this is literally the best show thats airing right now the story suspense in every minute wow

bocs cinematography
i cant stop thinking about this episode if the quality keeps up like this its going to be my fave bl ever along with moonlight chicken
one thing ive been wondering though  did we see the suicide attempt out of order chronologically did phee come back to help him after the breakup because after he cooled down he started connecting dots and couldnt reach non and got worried i mean he wouldnt have been so furious if he didnt deeply care for and love non


i think the message where non voices his fear of prison is right after the suicide attempt at the end of ep6


in my villain era
this episode woke up and choose violence lot of people are not going to be happy there is so much to like about this series i quite like the complexity of nons character and this episode is absolutely his villian origin story its be nice if we could get some more horror but looks like next week non is going to come unhinged
3252  surprise kiss
4204  oh boy we finally got some spice but probably not the one you want


cause of death the heart killers 
this episode woke up and choose violence
it chose murder i barely got to the other end alive
i barely got to the other side alive

phees cop dadnon should have listened to pheechanged schoolsnon why cant you see and feel what theyre doing to youyou keep coming back for more abusehave you no sense of pride and self preservationwhat do you hope to achievethese are shitty peopleeven jin is not enoughomg nonwhat kind of vibe does non give off theres phee jin now creeper teacher this comes with that condition where he takes lotsa medscreeper teacher will not give that much money for nothingone big stink bomb just blew up in their faces

my heart breaks for phee im gonna defend phee with everything i have
also jin turned out to be such an asshole so disappointed with him

ive had phee apologist in my bio since early on because i was sure that there had to be more than him just being a fuckboy who broke jins heart 
i still feel for jin though he got his heart broken and reacted instinctively

cause of death the heart killers 
those first 5 min have me with horny tears and the widest grin ever its not gonna last i know but boy they are so cute



profile badge for the achievement top 1 poster top 1 poster
my heart broke for phee 

im screaming and crying and throwing hands and pulling out my hair 
wtf are they doing to non he ended up hurting phee because of all these idiots
phee is like the best thing that happened to non and because of a bunch of insecure loosers non ended up lying and hurting phee  im shaking ffs 
what did non ever do to anyone for them to bully him so much to take advantage of him so much and i was freaking having hopes that jin was a good person but god damn what the heck when he did that i was screaming into my pillow for 10 minutes straight 
i wanna take them all put them in a bag and throw them to the sharks along with those stupid scammers
and to know phee end up with jin later on not knowing what jin did 

i just want to see the reaction tomorrow  barcode was like  guess what im an adult now so how many kiss do you want  
i just want lightening the mood because im so mad right now and i still believe jin is innocent  it wasnt him 


just stab me please it would hurt less 
that aside i seriously need tabarcode to be a permanent thing boc pls hear me out


tabarcode are so good together i feel like boc dont intend on pairing them up together in anything else so they used this opportunity to give people what they kept asking for since kinnporsche tabarcode even though it wont end with them together


well in conclusion nons life sucks and all murders by him will feel justified
i mean im assuming its him 
keng 
phee 
jin 

in light of this episode i went back to watch from the beginning and sooo many dropped hints are making sense but theres still so much to figure out the show opens with jin and non being hunted by the masked figure but where does that land in the timeline is there more than one killer as i type i can only come up with more questions
theres also the aspect of how do tan and white fit into this group we know they come into play in 12th grade so how do they and phee become key parts of the group this show is going to do my head in lol a week is too long for the next episode

is there a novel for this series

well i wanted tabarcode scenes and boy did i get them  what a rollercoaster
dont come for me but theres only so much of the constant pile on of a character that i can take before i just get annoyed with the story im ready for a break from non its just too much all the time i get theyre showing us how he gets to his breaking point but ive been over it and i do considering it cheating in a really disgusting manner and he lied to his boyfriends face he digs his holes deeper and doesnt use the brain hes got
phees the  for me this episode only confirmed what i knew i couldnt help but feel he was being manipulated this whole time by non i thought ta was wonderful esp when he sees nonpedophile teacher coming down the escalator together
im ready to jump forward in the flashback to tanwhitepheejin parts


bocs cinematography
i dont see it as cheating so much as the lying part keng groomed non when he was at his most emotionally vulnerable but the fact that he didnt tell phee about the money in the first place and then about having sex with keng when phee asked him outright twice if there was anything he was hiding that was the part that broke phee if non had asked for help with the money or with help with keng phee would have given it to him i mean he already got a police investigation fixed for him

yeah im sure the lying part hurt the worst for phee non was wrong for that 

its not cheating hes being sexually coerced by his teacher it seems possible to me that he may have been abused in the past would explain a whole lot about his characterization and mental health
like fault him for lying to phee sure 100  but dont call him being preyed on by his teacher cheating

a comment definitely not cheatinghe was preyed on and taken advantage of



sorry if my post triggered or pissed anyone off ill admit i posted this right after it aired so i was irritable venting and typing 
of course this is way more nuanced way more complex than cheating and i know its all being ripped away from him but i still view non as still having his own agency at least at this point so the choice he made to lie not be honest is what burns the worst and the escalator scene just came off so casual on his part
im ride or die for phee at this point i just always want him to have the upper hand but that wouldnt be interesting at all so ill just have to deal with it cause i cant quit the show now that its gotten good
i thought his story was a revenge story but now im really not sure anymore he might reluctantly get pulled back in by someone else like new
glad im rewatching last twilight to offset this show mhokday definitely help with the feels


im speechless at this episode barcode acting is so damn good im   hahahahhahahaa bro but ngl the teacher is kinda hot  and the fact he gave non money  sugar daddy vibes fr  but is the teacher a bad guy or something


the characters i despite are tee his so horrible fluke just goes with the crowd top blames everything he does on someone else or gets his friends to fix his problems por is horrible hes very arrogant and superficial he thinks having money gives him status jin is such a bystander he literally watching his get bullied rather than to help him no back bone he should grow one non is literally just a victim whos just succumbing to peer pressure non literally is naive and believes that those group of people are his friends when in reality just using him to escape from their own problems when non has his own problems phee is literally such a sweetheart hes so in love with non that he would go to the end of the world with him literally do anything for him and mr kang that teacher is a groomer who just using non for his sexual pleasures which is disgusting since non is literally underaged


i also want to add when i first watched this series i thought to myself that no one is innocent in this no matter how innocent the story portrays them as


i am interested in watching this but i hate horror does anyone have the timestamps for the scary stuff on all the released episodes so i can skip it


oh man what an episode this might be an unpopular opinion but non certainly just keeps digging his own hole deeper and deeper making a bunch of shitty decisions even if desperate at this point im kind of done with him im sorry
also phee is such a champ im very curious how this situation with him and jin will work out since jin leaked that video and all phee better be alive by the end of this
also damn jin i did not see that one coming

where do yall watch the episode

im at work still processing this episode i was struggling with a lot of the bullying hi autistic sense of justice but this episode was tough to get through i need to go back and rewatch the series so far because theres so many different truths coming out but also i get jin liked non but he never tried saying anything and his attempts to save non from his friends felt weak idk idk idk its so much to work through

still watching the episode but so far nons shirts are always on point love them


probably you wont believe me but i swear i was having anxiety watching the episode and i was not wrong
oh non my poor child you were so obsessed with not needing help that you ended up hitting rock bottom
im so glad that the teacher ends up dead in the present he rd a teenager using money and nons despair
jin didnt leak the video but he clearly shared it with his shitty friends and one of them probably tee top or por leaked it just for the laughs stupid jin you were the last nail in nons coffin
non probably will go apeshit and end up murdered by the bs or taking his own life in the forest
poor phee he and non actually were the real victims of all this shit phee telling non to get lost and die were probably his last words and it took a toll on him and its probably the reason of the revenge
at this time i want phee killing all of them in the forest nobody of these trash deserve to live


does anyone know how old non is suppose to be please i mean is he 18 because otherwise keng is being awfully calm consider that someone filmed him have sx with an underage student


hes in his last year of high school so most likely around 1415 and age of consent in thailand is 15 which still doesnt excuse what keng did tbh

i finally was able to see the last two episodes and omg so much stuff is going on
as some of you mentioned already i am not sure that jin is the one who released the video he didnt press the button and the computer crashed because of the beer and not the keyboard getting pressured to post the video and it may be one of the other a since apparently the video has been saved on the cloud i am not justifying the fact he took the video that was an a move of his part but hes heartbroken and he saw that non was with a guys in clearly a romantic way  i dont think he saw phee face so for him i think the logic is non  cheater and liar i need to confront him or something
poor phee he deserves so much love for how supportive he is
speaking of phee and non yes non is so much in his mess that he will do anything to get out  that explain the teacher thing but  it is a controversial idea  it seems that he used to have a certain behavior according to phee and is under a load of medication so maybeand again it is a controversial idea it is not the first time he cheated on phee i doubt that or he used to have more than 1 fwb also hes still lying to phee not about the money but about the movie too the scene when he talked to phee about continuing filming even though they were bullying him make me think that he may have a bit of a feeling for jin and that what make phee worried about also maybe non have some emotional issues  go back to the pills ill say depression and a kind of imprintment disorder or im totally wrong and just overanalyse everything



waah im mindblown tbh i was getting bored with the show in the beginning no offense to the actors but it was full of unnecessary jumpscares and bloodi was not feeling itit felt slow
but entrance of non changed this show and wow boc really did good job hiring barcode he really is so talented im impressed with his acting out of those frnds i only can forgive fluke that med student with glasses he was a silent bystander which is a bad thing still he didnt directly hurt non yet so i think he needs to be exempted
others all can got to hell even that tee guy screw him i know ur fathers health matters and hes stuck with his uncle still he really messed up nons life terribly just bcoz ur miserable doesnt mean u can drag ppl to hell nd nxt week preview seems like hell help his uncle to kill non
and non i might sound like a sadist  but i support him hes spiralling like crazy in next ep and is about to diebut im curioushe lost phee and is all alone i know the tutor will ness up everything so with no support no wonder he goes crazy
now pheehis cop father is involved too i know its going to end badly
jin too like waah hes the wolf in sheeps clothing screw him idc abt pheejin now eventho phee forgives jin etc etc whatever ill never forgive him for what he did to non its horrible to be viewed when doing stuff nd sharing in twitter disgusting
and  i always thought jj was hot in kinnporsche  nd hes still hot aaaaaahhh boc will survive if they continue making unique shows and also if they dont let go of the writer especially writer sammon she wrote triage ofc i know shes talented love her
i cant imagine how a teen like non will handle all this shit i pity him poor soul
waah love this series  it has all the elements i like waah im enjoying itthey gave tabarcode jjbarcodestill against grooming tho   but barcode really is that hidden card in the series


these flashback episodes have been so heartbreaking i was literally bawling at the end of the last one but they are also an absolute masterclass at constructing a persons downward spiral and it would be completely understandable if non did snap and is the killer or if he killed himself tbh if the latter did happen though my heart would break for phee he probably blames himself the most for not being able to protect the guy he loved and telling non to go and die probably haunts him
also in present day it has got to be phee and tan in this revenge plot together i remember jin having mentioned that they were particularly close even to the point that jin thought they were sleeping together too if tan was the brother  new  it would make complete sense that they infiltrated this friend group together white though i feel like he may have been a victim of bullying in the past it would be a huge conflict with tee once all his previous actions get revealed and maybe help tee realize the gravity of his actions not a redemption because lets be honest he doesnt deserve one but an interesting arc for sure


originally posted this on the wrong ep but i figured it out
i honestly wondered if boc would be saving barcodes first onscreen kiss for jeff in wuju bakery but lord
that young man got some this week
like i genuinely gasped at the sneaky kiss and then my brain me l t e d with what followed
so so so proud of barcode and ta this week acting was incredible


awww how i wish non and phee will be together again cus they were cute together


jin didnt do well even he wanted phee he could have done it in a nice way than taking that video of them so he was the cus of the break up but no matter what he did when phee took jin to the river side you guys remember what he said to jin he will never forget non
