Non going off on Tee is so heartbreaking. He's completely right. Poor kid. He didn't do anything to deserve this and hopefully Tee feels like the pos he is. It is good to know he's not a complete psycho willing to let Non be killed but he definitely still sucks.

That scene was a punch to the gut because he was spitting facts. Tee intervening on behalf of Non because he didn't want to carry that guilt on his conscience but ultimately only delayed the inevitable was poetic to say the least.

At this point I honestly have no idea how they are going to end this, we are barreling towards the end and I'm at the edge of my seat...as long as they don't pull a Whisperer, I'm all good.

I did like they focused on Tee in this episode, they gave him more depth, and hummanized. The moral ambiguity of everyone in this series is so well done.

No sexy time or scary time this go around but

41:00 - makeout with White and Tee

Tee sucks big time and I can't begin to explain how f-ed up everything he did to Non was. Keeping him alive was more about his own conscience and not about what was best for Non. And then they sucker punched us with Tee's origin story and grey characters have never been better. Although this episode seemed to throw that theory to the drain, I still hope a last plot twist with White. Ugh, that kiss on the stairs was so cute...

Now, Non is dead and I've never felt so sad for being right. His little note left me with a heartache that I can't explain. I pumped my fist when Phee told New he loved Non. He always will and now that he knows what hapoened he can move on. Unlike New who really is out for their heads.

I think we can fairly say that the ending next week won't be a happy one.

Please if anyone can translate thr sticky notes on the board? Phee New were actually the meme.

Por's mom sucksssss. All of the adults on this show are abhorrent, it's like a Roald Dahl novel.

Yeah that's a great question. I mean, I still don't understand why Non was targeted and bullied the way he was. Why did they call him Greasy?

Maybe it was Non's sexuality that the group hated him for, despite Jin and and Tee also being (secretly?) queer? I guess we never found out if Por, Fluke or Top are queer or straight, so if they are straight and Jin and Tee were closeted at the time, it could be homophobia that motivated their bullying?

Non wasn't poor and he is also good at school and physically strong/larger than some of the other boys. I get that his personality was a bit alternative, so maybe that's why he was picked on? Being "weird"? Hard to say.

It didn't seem like Non had an ounce of sleep, food, or water. He was so weak like starved. Like how can they expect him to be an indentured servant working like a mule when he was so weak. Normally you hear those nasty mafia/brothel people tend to take care of you while adding to your debt. Oh medicine, bandaids etc that's going to cost you 100x the price of it and it will be added to your overall debt so that his debt never ends.

- I had to pause a couple of times because I couldn't stop crying. And I'm someone who's considered aloof with thick walls built around me, so that's not typical for me. JJay fucking killed me this episode. When his dad cupped his face and then started laughing about his grey hair, my heart broke. Especially after Perth's character said (paraphrase) "In this life, if you have to choose, you choose yourself". Tee has NEVER chosen himself. Even when we see him being completely wrong with Non (and Non was absolutely correct to hate him for it), but he got into this life to help his Dad, and he refused to leave Non behind, and then in the present, he's willing to put himself in front of a bullet for White. What a heartbreaking fucking character. He's done wrong and should be punished, but he's so nuanced and messy and he really is trapped in that life. When he burned Non's note and it floated away, it was such a gorgeous shot, but my heart was shattered.

- Oh fucking hell, White was Tee's salvation. He told himself he didn't deserve love, and then here came this beautiful boy and insisted on pushing himself into Tee's life. So there isn't some big mastermind there where White is an evil twink (I kinda would have lived), but how we see that White was a glimpse of the life that Tee wanted (like how he yelled at his father - he just wanted to be a normal, happy kid), I feel like he's also going to wind up being Tee's end. Tee will sacrifice himself to save White, and the only goodness he was able to scrounge out of life.

- White must be ill. We saw him hallucinating those boils, and then he sees Tee being disgusted by him when his fear is revealed.

- Phee and New show how different justice and vengeance are. They may have had the same goal as 'the truth', but New is ready to burn the world. Phee is his father's son - he's not a murderer. New is doing an extended suicide. He never wanted to come out of this alive, and now that he knows Non is dead, there is no going back after this. He wanted the truth, but New has pushed this whole thing to the point of insanity.

- I was really hoping that Non would come back alive, but I guess that was too much to ask for considering how fucking deep into hell he was. Just like Perth's character said - there is no going back once you're in that life. But, I STILL am holding out hope that someone 'bought' Non and Uncle Joe was just saying that to keep Tee out of the business. And, how did Uncle Joe die?????

- I don't know if it's coincidence or just because it's a popular spot for local teenage boys, but that stairwell where White and Tee kissed was the same area where we saw Phee and Non kissing.

- A lot of things seemed to be answered this week, but I still have more questions, so it doesn't feel like the last episode is just going to be round up. And I still wonder if Jin is going to be the Final Girl just like in the short movie, and he'll be the only one running out of that house alive.

I agree with you completely. Also Tee was just a kid. He was trying so hard to not have any feeling so he could survive he had no support at all much less from an adult. He was so invisible to everyone, especially his friends. I don’t think he even realized that Non could actually get hurt until it was far too late. Tee is not good but he’s not bad either, he really is the definition of gray. Before the episode started I said to my husband that I hoped they were going to be able to keep up the pace of how good this has been and not fumble it in the last episodes and so far so good- Tee was one of the more mysterious characters and I feel completely satisfied with his arc. And poor baby White, when he says ‘I didn’t even want to come’ and you see the enormity of guilt in Tee’s, it’s Shakespeareanigly tragic. So is the fact that New’s ENTIRE family is dead. This has hands down been the most intense BL I’ve ever watched.

Woof, that one was tough. Despite everything, I do feel bad for Tee. He's also being taken advantage of and abused. That being said, Non was right with everything he said and Tee doesn't get to resolve himself of guilt because "it was such a long time ago". It was 3 years, not 50.

It was really interesting that Tee's father was suffering from debilitating mental illness, not physical illness that forces Tee to have to support them. It made me feel so much worse for Tee and how trapped he is.

Poor White seems like he really did just get caught up with the wrong group and now is going to be emotionally traumatized for the rest of his life, which may end up being like, 2 more hours.

Por's mom sucksssss. All of the adults on this show are abhorrent, it's like a Roald Dahl novel.

Does anyone else think that Non may secretly still be alive? I know it's a longshot but maybeeeee....

Anyway, I'm sad now so I'm gonna go watch the Phee-Non falling in love montage 8 times in a row.

The most ironic thing is that that phrase was said by a person who despised Non, while the two boys who were supposed to love him were the first to judge him and turn their backs on him.

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this whole thing ends with them all dead. But tbh I really want White and Phee to come out of all this alive and as ok as one can be in this situation. People are hating on Phee a lot, and like I agree that him liking Jin is bad and like def a betrayal considering Jin's involvement with everything, but I don't think him turning on New was something to hate on. Like Phee is a genuinely good guy so it's pretty in character for him to not want to kill people, he wanted people to confess and then go to the authorities with that info. Phee wants justice, New wants revenge. They should all go to prison for a long time except for Phee, White, and New (who should get mental health help instead because while he killed people he didn't do it while in a clear state of mind). Anyways I'm hella excited to see how the series ends although I can't believe we have to wait a week 😭😭😭😭

Side note-- the acting is so good holy shit they are doing an amazing job.

I was genuinely surprised with all the hates towards Phee. Where was that coming from? Sure he pushed Non away when he needed him the most but like his reaction was kind of valid? It must’ve hurt him so bad seeing his lover had s*x with other person and later find them hugging and comforting each other. People seem to forget that Non reassured him that there’s nothing going on with the tutor. Non hides things from him (which is understandable because he doesn’t want to drag Phee into this mess) but Phee wanted to be relied on, he wouldn’t mind getting involved in whatever that happened in Non’s life because he truly does care and love Non. I don’t blamed him for his reactions at that time. He didn’t know Non was already on the verge of breaking point at that time and he unknowingly pushes Non further with his rejection. It was sad. Yeah he did catch feelings for Jin in the process so people might see this as betrayal towards Non. But then he rejected him after realizing he might actually be cheating on Non. But now it’s been three years, he really just wanted to know the truth, to find closure and moved on with his life. Phee protecting Jin and wanted to save everyone (whoever left) was on brand of him, he always has this savior complex plus he never signed up for things to escalate this much. New pretty much blindsided him. After the final, seeing how even in his hallucinations he wanted to be with Jin after everything kinda pissed me off because why would you still want to be with someone who’s directly involved with Non’s miserable ending and this is the only thing that I would never defend him for lol. I guess this shows his strong desire to move on and to start fresh. Other than that, he was such a sweetheart really. I don’t think his character should warranted so much hate.

This episodes... wow. I knew it wasn't likely but I still wanted to hope that Non was alive. Tee did a lot of stupid shit that led to this whole mess but just like Non, he's just a kid. Between dealing with his uncle and taking care of his father, he's been in survival mode for a long time. He's not a bad or evil person, but Tee has definitely forced himself to ignore red flags and refuse to feel regret in order to survive.

It looks like the finale will force everyone to confront their fears. I wonder who will make it out alive.

God, I can't believe the final is almost here, there's still so many questions left unanswered??? Just of the top of my head...

(Sorry in advance for how scrambled this is)

What happened to Tee's uncle?

Why was the masked killer wearing crutches in some of the early scenes?

Who was Keng talking to on the phone? Could it be related to Perth's character somehow?

And what's the deal with Perth anyway? I don't think they'd just introduce a character like that so late in the show if he didn't have a role to play (also, I'm a crazy, or does he kinda look a bit like White?)

Then there's also the dropped axed from last episode (which the camera lingered suspiciously long on), and the marks on the trees.

Also, does anyone else think we might have another White twist coming up? It's kind of suspicious that he just shows up immediately after Non is found dead. And the boils, what's up with that? Sex work, organ trade?

Oh, and is Non actually dead??? Or could someone, maybe Perth, have helped him fake his death?

Edit: they also keep emphasizing how smart White is, which is also kinda 👀

Yes there was someone else in costume when they first arriaved with non there to make a movie. And none of them was under a influance of drugs. So who was it?

I am still expecting that there will be a nine person in the house. When poor got impaled there was someone who cut his arm and hide a knife inside the house. Both tan and phee were bussy so it cant be them. Also i dont think that in first episode the hand that touched tee crotch was a hallucination but real hand instead. There is still question who mark the tree that looks like trap to make someone walk in circles like Phee and Jin.

I also think the hand was real, and not a hallucination.

There's also the time Fluke hallucinated that Por was choking him to death. It begins with the door behind them opening, wind blows in, and then, as Por is choking him, Fluke sees the masked killer behind them. When the hallucination ends the door is still open.

And, right after that scene, we see Tan/New reacting to some sound downstairs (I can't remember what it was -- a scream, a think? It's also possible that he might have been hallucinating it). Then, out of New/Tan's field of vision, we see the masked killer run past the camera.

Another thing I've been thinking about... the bathroom hallucination with Top. For one thing, the masked killer is using crutches -- a detail that would be very strange for Top to hallucinate. Then there's the loud breathing from the masked killer. At first, I didn't think much of it, but what if the masked killer is wearing some kind of gas mask underneath? That would shield him from Tan/New's wacky cigarette conception later. Also, there's a lot of smoke behind him as he enters the room.

another great ep! Love Tee's backstory, you really get an understanding of why he did everything he did. And I LOVE how he suffered lol and how Non never forgave him and he is still living with all this guilt even after Tee busted his ass trying to save Non's life, put himself in front of his uncle's guns and goons, got a part time job to give all his money to Non, checked on him at teh club, defended him to customers, got his own pay docked for Non's mistakes etc, like you really got a sense that Tee was trying to atone. Even as he was telling the story back to the guys, he never defended himself or tried to paint himself out to be like WELL I TRIED AND POR/TOP/ETC WAS WORSE so I really buy his guilt and his attempt at atonement. Also the actor did an AMAZING job, I'm convinced he's the best actor in the cast sans Barcode.

Love manic pixie dream twink White walking into Tee's life and giving him hope and humanity and light again. Love that White seemed interested the second Tee stood up and was confirmed tall lmao same. I am still rooting for White/Perth/Non revenge of the twinks who also took down Uncle in the background plot but I doubt it'll happen.

I'm trying to mitigate my expectations by telling myself next ep is just going to be all of them having their own guilt hallucinations, then the narrative will forgive them, New will be punished for his wanting vengence, and Phee/Jin will live happily ever after but I'm dreading it. New, sweetie, I am still rooting for blood, too.

I am so unsatisfied that Jin is just going to coast through a punishment for what he did. He doesn't even seem that guilty that he posted the tape! It's like he really believes his excuse that he told Phee, that he was mad at Non for Non's boyfriend's sake which is such bullshit. This ep did such a good job of showing Tee's regret and even had Por of all people point out that the tutor was pure evil for preying on a student -- the narrative knows that the Keng/Non situation was predatory and awful! So why won't it properly punish Jin!! There have been no moves made to see his attempt at redemption or penance it's driving me NUTS. I want to see some bone shaking guilt crying screaming that we got with Tee and some ACTION for ONCE on Jin's part. alas I fear main ship plot armor really will protect Jin and he'll just get the guy (Phee, you punk ass traitor) and move on with his life ugh. Still excited for the last ep tho!

The reason why you don't see any guilt from Jin is because he doesn't actually feel guilty. Yea he doesn't like that he played a part in Non's death but he thinks what he did isn't as bad as what Tee did which is funny. I think with this eps i can kinda see Tee in a better light, I still don't like him and think he's a bad guy but its clear to me that what he did wasn't something he did to hurt Non in particular. What Tee did to Non could've happen to anyone, even White if the time was different. Jin on the other hand made Non's life worse on purpose, what he did was targeted and would not have happened to anyone else. We can tell all of this by how he he's been reacting to all of this info coming out. When Phee tells him whats really going on, he yells at Phee as if he an innocent bystander, and then when he confess about what he did he makes it seem like it was a small thing. Notice how when everyone finds out that Non is dead, everyone is reacting is some way and Jin is just unconcerned, no anger, no sadness just worried about himself. Even White who didnt know Non from what we know felt something for Non, but Jin, hes just concerned about himself. IMO I'm ok with whatever happens as long as Jin gets his punishment. All the purely evil black and white characters have been killed except for him. I'm not a big fan of him getting away with everything, while people who've done less have gotten worst outcomes.

If Por of all people pointed out the truth about Keng, it’s a little odd that the writers wouldn’t have a “nice guy” like Jin showing any guilt or remorse over his actions. He admits to having filmed the video but he doesn’t really seem sorry about it, which contrasts against Tee who tries to help Non multiple times this episode out of his own guilt. I’m holding onto a shred of hope that Jin actually helps Non in some way (there’s a couple shots where only Jin’s reflection is visible, hinting that he might be lying about something) but that doesn’t explain why he’s moving to America. He also says, “Non must really love Keng” - does he still believe Non isn’t a victim of grooming? It’s honestly bizarre to see Tee silently shedding tears when Non confronts him while Jin appears to be mostly unaffected and hasn’t cried for anyone but his own broken heart. At this point I can’t tell if the show is going to rebuke Jin for his actions, if he’s still part of some unknown plot, or it’s discreetly endorsing the lack of consequences for his behavior.

If their intention is for Jin to come out of this show as the main pair final boy hero then they really did not think his writing through. They should have never had him playing entitled nice guy if they never intended to explore his guilt. Agreed so much on your comment!

I don't think a happy ending was ever in the cards. The writers even said it wasn't a romance. I saw someone on Twitter say that this is a 'dead dove don't eat' show that people are trying to shoehorn into a romance.

I just don't want any Phee/Jin ship affecting the ending. I feel maybe they want to promote them as the it couple for later project and want to emphasis on them.

But I believe in the production.

So Por ended up being the voice of reason by calling Keng evil, I didn't see that coming. Phee turning the gun on Tan/New was predictable. Tan/New not giving a damn was the episode highlight. "I don't care about your f*cking ethics". Then he had plan B, it turned out he lied to Phee about marking the laced ones with an X. What is the plan now though? Next week they seem to be living out their worst fears. Phee being responsible for Nons death, Jin either seeing Keng/Non again or himself being filmed?, Tee loosing White?

I have no idea how it's going to end but White must survive. Imagine just stumbling into this mess of a 'friend' group. The TeeWhite scenes were cute but Tee is still an asshole. If he hurts White like the preview suggests I will riot.

NGL, kinda procrastinated on this bc it’s the 2nd to last ep and I don’t want this show to end. But I gotta find out how White fits into this whole puzzle, and whether Phee will succumb to the drug New has been fucking around with, and who’s gonna be next on Death’s list.

Ya know, for someone surrounded by gang activity, who concocted a somewhat elaborate scheme to save Top’s ass and fulfill his criminal uncle’s demands, Tee is pretty damn naive. Ma boy, you yourself threatened Non w/ selling his organs if he ratted you out to the cops. You had to know that this wouldn’t be an idle threat coming from your uncle, right? And iirc, your uncle never actually promised that he’d let Non live in the first place. What the fuck else did you expect to happen?? Non even calls him out on it, baffled why Tee would send him to die only to save him at the last second, and why he’d put Non through all this just bc he didn’t want him in their friend group.

At first when Non is railing at Tee, I thought Barcode’s delivery was weird and I couldn’t tell if he was laughing or crying or what. And then I realized towards the end that it was both. It was a mocking derisive laugh mixed with crying, and all overlaid w/ wheezing bc he’s been beaten so badly that he can’t actually get enough air to properly scream at Tee. Barcode, the actor you’re growing up to be is such a relief. Thai bl needs more talent like you.

Love how everyone else is also calling Tee out on his hypocrisy, even nameless gang twink.

So, has Tee been skipping school to work more to help Non w/ his debt? I would see this as more of a redemption if he hadn’t had a million opportunities to get Non out of this previously. Hold up, so they all know that Tee drugged Non…why tf are they still considering Tee a friend and trusting him?? Why is he still in their group long after Non is considered gone for good? Like, do none of them know about Tee’s connection to shady characters? I get that at this point Por and Jin still don’t know that Non was framed for the camera breaking, nor do they know that Tee was the one who got Non to do the horse accounts to get the money for it. But they HAVE to suspect something, right?!

I don’t quite understand how much time is passing here, cus Non is still pretty banged up but it seems like Tee’s pretty much dropped out of school to work. Eeeesh what if Non’s just continuing to be beaten. Ugh, I don’t care of there’s enough baht in that envelope to make Kinn blush, it doesn’t make up for what you’d done to the totally innocent kid for absolutely no fuckin reason.

See, I say that then they immediately show us how Tee’s been unfairly parentified and the way that forced him into his uncle’s claws. I just….no, it doesn’t make what he’s done to Non excusable. Not in any sort of way whatsoever. I know people in real life who were forced into some pretty awful situations and had to grow up fast like that, but they still didn’t frame a kid they barely knew and pull that kid into an even worse situation than their own. BUT, I will say that from what we now know that Tee has been given very few choices in life and has not been set up to be in a position where he can afford to be generous or empathetic. He’s in survival mode, which is what initiated his decision to use the broken camera to get Non into the horse account scam in the first place. It’s not an excuse, but it is somewhat of an explanation. Tho I am a little confused about what’s actually wrong w/ his dad. It has to be some sort of mental illness, or maybe a brain injury that’s left him disabled, cus if he were a drunk I don’t think Tee would be going through so much just to keep him safe.

Hold up hold up. They all knew that Non was working for Tee’s uncle to repay his debt from the money he took from the horse accounts? OK, I feel dumb, I thought they knew nothing about it and were just blindly trusting Tee and thought Non had run away or something. But, do they know that Tee got Non into the money laundering in the first place, or do they just think that Non got himself into a mess and Tee is using his connections to help him out? I’m confused about who knows what at this point. Tho admittedly I’m probably overthinking it lol.

Side note, what the actual fuck happened to Keng? Was he already sold off to organ harvesters before Tee intervened for Non? Is the picture of him leaving w/ Non fake, or is that not actually Keng?

Man the whiplash I just had w/ Por. First he’s a complete asshole for trying to deflect blame away from himself bc if he’d just owned up to not taking care of his precious camera like he should have in the first place, none of this would have happened. He left it in an unlocked classroom with his idiot friends, what the fuck did he expect to happen. But then he is the only one of the bunch who calls out Keng for the predator that he is and how fucked up it is that Non is running off w/ him.

Huh, Tee went looking for Non at the casino, so he must know that the photo is faked to draw media attention away from the uncle. I was wondering about that.

Well fuck. Did he just succumb to internal bleeding or something? I wanna feel more about this, but I just can’t help feeling like Non isn’t actually dead yet. But if he isn’t that begs the question of how he’d fake it convincingly to the uncle who I’m sure has seen more than his fair share of dead bodies.

Oh. The note. Look….I’m not ruling out the possibility that Non faked his death. I mean, his own brother conned an entire school and magically became walter white just to make his brothers bullies confess their sins. The show is not immune to wild swings. But whether it’s fake or not, Non’s death truly HIT me with that absolutely soul crushing note (which thankfully confirmed that it had only been a couple weeks) burning through the air.

Of course as soon as Tee tells himself he doesn’t deserve to be happy, the perfect boy just struts right into his life. The world is truly not fair sometimes. To be totally fair he does resist White’s pursuit for seemingly quite a while. But…so is White truly just an innocent bystander who fell for the grumpy tall dude at his local internet cafe? Huh. I don’t know how to feel about that. On the one hand, it would be pretty contrived for him to also have some elaborate plan of his own or something, and not great pacing to wait to introduce it so late in the game. It’s much more realistic to have at least 1 person who’s just a pure-ish soul so they can be the audience surrogate to feel the real horror of the situation. On the other, it still feels kinda wrong to have him be totally innocent in such a convoluted story. He might be the most unlucky of the bunch.

It’s so odd, but kind of brilliant, to see such a different but similarly framed meetcute love story origins between Tee and White as we saw for Phee and Non. It’s also fascinating to see a glimpse of how if Tee hadn’t been in such a dire life situation, if he hadn’t been having to get his hands dirty to survive for so long, how he could have turned out so much more like Phee. Protective, nurturing, a little prone to jealousy, would do anything for the boy they love.

I still have questions, like how did Tee take care of his dad when he went to college, and if he quit working for his uncle entirely and got by w/ part time jobs (and if so why didn’t he do that a helluva lot sooner, I hate the whole “innocent bambi finally convinced me to clean my life up” trope). But it’s good to have at least most of the truth out there finally. Tho I will say Phee and New should probably be reacting more strongly to the confirmation that Non is dead. I get that they’ve had like 3 years now to come to terms w/ it, and from their little murder board they came up with I’d wager they put at least some of the pieces together before even getting to the house. But still. I knew Phee wasn’t going to actually shoot anyone but I don’t understand why he just let New toke up on his murder weed like that.

For the finale it looks like we’re gonna get a lot of hallucination scenes, so it’ll be interesting to parse out what’s real and what’s not. Of course my biggest question is whether Non’s really dead or not, which the preview isn't helping bc a seemingly alive Non is jumping off a building. Oh, theory! So the bully gang mostly has an aversion to Non helping w/ their movie and call him Greasy and just generally imply that he’s very much not popular at their school. We know that he’d been taking medication, and that when he made the boyfriend proposal Phee mentioned that Non had been through hard times, and we’ve also seen that he may not be the most mentally stable person. So I’d already theorized that perhaps Non had a previous mental health crisis that was in public or knowledge of it got spread around school, maybe a bipolar manic episode or suicide attempt or severe panic attach, and that is why he’d gained a reputation as a weirdo at school and been largely ostracized by his parents and classmates. What if that scene in the preview is a flashback to that incident, or maybe a hallucination by Phee where he imagines he was there to stop Phee and how different both of their lives would have been. Hmmm, perhaps farfetched, but who knows. As for the fates of the rest, I genuinely have no clue and that’s so exciting. It’s hard to imagine any of them moving on from this horrorfest of a weekend, not just emotionally but literally. People died, someone’s gonna have to go to prison for that. Unless New somehow also dies and when the authorities come they just lay all the blame on him, which wouldn’t even entirely be a lie.

Jin and Fluke are cut from the same cloth - bystanders. Whereas Jin tried to play the good guy and Fluke just stood back completely passive. But, I feel like we are going to be thrown a curveball with Jin's character.

Taking a FFVII Rebirth break to focus on my other hyperfixation!

I really, really hope that this show has an ending that's satisfying. It doesn't have to be happy, or even what I expect, but I hope it's at least satisfying. Honestly though, I don't even know WHAT I expect for an ending. That's what's so good about this show so far.

Good episode, but some things still don't make sense.

One of them is why Jin keeps seeing a bloody Keng when he is hallucinating? According to the show all he knows is that Keng ran away with Non. So something is missing there.

And watching the first episode there should be a 9th character wearing the mask. If Non is dead then who could that be? In the first episode when Por was lured out and got poked plus slashed with a knife both Phee and Tan/New where in the house with others.

Oh well next week we should get all the full picture. Hoping for a good ending where everything clicks.

Okay crazy theory I have to get out of my brain so I can sleep. It's the last week we can have crazy theories about what's going to happen, so indulge me:

- In one of the lives, Jet started rambling about Top and he started saying something about Top's family life and everyone was like "bitch are you just spoiling??". What if Top's dad is one of Uncle Joe's goons, so Top's relationship with Tee this whole time has been a mirror of Joe and the goons. So what if he knows what happened to Non's 'body' (they never zipped up the body bag so I'm being delulu that Non is still alive). I think that Top still has a larger role to play here.

I think it will probably be Bas that will be Bible's new partner, but I actually really love the idea of Perth and Bible. Perth has a sassy energy that pairs well with Bible's more quiet energy - that dynamic reminds me a bit of BillyBabe.

Am I the only one who thinks Non isn't dead? The note he left behind doesn't seem like a suicide note to me.. if anything, I took it as a hint that he will do anything to get out of this place, including faking his death. I think Perth's character helped him do this and got him somewhere safer. I just refuse to believe that Non would die, and that the scene would feel so anticlimactic without us seeing anything happen when Non is in the centre of every event that takes place.. I am placing my bets on him making his appearance in the final ep next week.

As to Tee, I can say that I definitely understand him much better now. Of course, just because his life is shitty he didn't have the excuse to ruin Non's, but at least I saw why he became the way he was and while yes, he did the bare minimum by trying to help Non after putting him in this situation, it made me sympathize with him more than I could with anyone else of the friend group.

So curious to see what will happen the next episode

I also don't believe he's dead. The deaths we've seen in this show have all been tied to important aspects of each character's story - from Por dying surrounded by his family's wealth to Top losing his own free will to the corrupt criminal justice system oppressing people living in poverty like Non’s parents. If he really had died, I don't think the show would have just shown him being manhandled into a body bag. We don’t know what Perth or Keng were doing during this episode so I think it’s likely Perth and maybe a few other people like the journalists working to bring down Uncle Joe helped him fake his death and escape.

This was a great episode. We get a little bit of humanization from everybody, even Por. We get an inside look into Tee’s home life, and it's tough to watch. No kid should have to face what he's going through. We don’t know how long he's been dealing with it, but his struggles remind me of young people who resort to illegal means like dealing drugs to provide for their families and kids who have to look after their own parents and younger siblings.

There have been BLs in the past that tackled classism, but this show integrates commentary on class and morality in a way that doesn’t necessarily romanticize it or tug on your heartstrings. None of them radiate “babygirl” energy (except White). Tee’s character poses an important question: can a person make ethical choices in a bad environment with so few options? How much does the ability to be morally good and empathetic depend on one's socioeconomic status? For those living at and below the poverty line, survival and meeting basic needs often takes precedence over larger social issues with moral implications like climate change and foreign conflicts. Tee and Phee share a lot of similarities, with scenes in the neon pink-lit room and the garden/lake paralleling their roles as protectors. Phee risks himself and his family to help Non with his debt and doesn't hesitate to treat Jin’s injuries, and Tee shields White with his body, takes on an extra job for Non, and assumes the role of caretaker for his father. But while Phee has a supportive parent and a comfortable home life, Tee’s home life is a mess. He’s in survival mode, emulating the actions of the adults that raised him: violence, bluster, and coercion. Like an animal hiding their wounds, he has a stoic demeanor and doesn’t expose his vulnerabilities towards his friends, wearing a poker face both at the casino and at school. His love for White turns into his salvation - he becomes a more open, carefree person that he might have been in a better environment.

However, Tee seems disgusted by Non in a way that goes beyond his status as an outsider, and avoids him like the plague in the flashbacks. I think it’s possible that he sees his own lowness reflected in him, and instead of offering solidarity, his internalized stigma and single-minded focus on survival has him working against Non and scamming the poor kid instead of richer and dumber targets like Por and Top. This dynamic reflects the phenomenon of lateral violence, where marginalized communities harm each other instead of unifying against the institutions and the people in power that subjugated them, like Por and Tee’s uncle. But Tee preys on Non and sabotages him, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and oppression.

It’s interesting that Perth and Tan deliver opposing beliefs about acting in self-interest: “If it comes down to it, worry only about yourself” and “We need to stick together to survive.” This show was billed as a slasher but it seems to be more like a psychological horror story exploring what obligations people have to help each other, if any, and the responsibilities that systems and institutions have to serve the people that exist within them. Each character represents a distinct point on the socioeconomic and moral spectrum: Por represents the wealthy exploiting and stealing people’s work, Top is a loud-mouthed sycophant trying to stay in Por’s good graces, Fluke is a passive, complicit bystander hungry to join the ranks of the rich and influential, Jin, while conscientious, rarely translates his instincts into tangible action, and Non’s family faces severe financial hardship, forced to choose between paying for basic necessities or their eldest son’s tuition, which leads to the mistreatment and neglect of their younger son. In this story the rich just seem to be inexplicably awful users and exploiters. Tee’s uncle refuses to cover his brother or brother-in-law’s care, and Por’s father capitalizes on the success of his son’s film to boost his own reputation. His mother disparages Non’s broken family with a smile.

If next week is the finale, this show almost feels too short for all the plot threads that are still left hanging. Who are the masked killer(s)? Does Fluke get into medical school? Does the PheeJin ship sail? Does New get the mental help he needs? How can anybody escape the house without a driver?

At this point a good ending would not not be all of them dead. Maybe White surviving. But I'm sure they'll be able to stick him with something in the last episode, too.

I am still expecting that there will be a nine person in the house. When poor got impaled there was someone who cut his arm and hide a knife inside the house. Both tan and phee were bussy so it cant be them. Also i dont think that in first episode the hand that touched tee crotch was a hallucination but real hand instead. There is still question who mark the tree that looks like trap to make someone walk in circle like Phee and Jin. I can imagine that in the last minute of the final episode when "final girl" will think that he is safe there came a plot twist that there always been somone else who want reveange.

I feel bad for tee but i can't forgive him for what he did... Non is dead and his family he ruined all the 4...but i also have my doubts non is alive i guess and that note where he says I'll get out of here I'm not loser is sus maybe he's pretending to be dead or ate that medicine from pit babe where charlie did not breathe for 2 hrs and is alive 🤓 i dont know I'm delusional 😂😂...

After this mess this episode was, I just have one question: Who killed Tee's uncle? It was just accidental? or a normal death? The newspaper said he was found dead in strange circumstances.
I find weird just to say "He is dead" if it's not related to the plot.

I am a the only one who think that in according to prewiew Tan will probablly drug them all and make them under the influence of drugs and visions of non to hunt each other just like he did to Top? In prewiew that was leaked last week we can see some of them in the forest when they have a halucination of non and non ask phee if he really want to protect him.

You know the way people say ,if the person didn't die on screen then they might not actually be dead and that there's a possibility they might come back. this is how I felt before episode 11. I didn't really believe non was dead because we didn't see him die.

But if this show has taught me anything it's that, they don't show us new characters for no reason. A lot of things are deeper than they seem and there's a lot more nuance to the characters we consider to be villains or antagonists. Now that I'm finished rambling 😂 This statement might bite me in the ass later but ,a part of me still doesn't think non is dead
