the director madeaw of the historic and award winning first thai bl love of siam 2007 who also directed ohm in madeaws also award winning dew the movie and then icons of the thai bl series industry maxtul in their last series together which was the first thai bl to break into the mystery and crime genre which was groundbreaking manner of death and manner of death written by sammon now coming back with dead friend forever as a screenwriter authors of novels being involved in the screenwriting is so crucialthese are all good indicators
yes boc had issues and they were rookies but regardless the production of kinnporsche was also groundbreaking
so now these same people breaking bl into a new genre horror suspence gore yet again with actual bl and intimacy given the press release about the parents of the actors having approved the sex scenes makes me assume there will be intimacy it is a copypaste of the press release they put out when kp aired minus the line about the parents  i mean this has got to be entertaining at the very least but important to the genre of bl for sure so i am excited

in my villain era
one episode in and i am obsessed were getting an actual horror series and its got the gore and the sex they are hitting all the horror beats and im honestly here for it group of partying friends cabin in the woods communication cut off some dark secret from the pastim not even mad lets go
im digging the killer design too hard to give us a slasher with a good visual concept but im into this one less is more but this is effect and im into the practical effect yess
the premise is straight forward the stage is set and im in
episode 1  timestamps

3700 to 3900  more of the impaled 


i am living for these timestamps 


in my villain era



thank you for your service  i couldnt care less about the horror stuff im actually kinda squeamish so ill gladly avoid the  and focus on the 

i thought tee or white was gonna get offed at that nc scene usually during slashers teens having sex draws the killer out lol


bocs cinematography
well we did get the phantom hand on tees dick though



that was camp mawma


you got me rollin


in my villain era
if it was a movie  that would have been the case but we got 15 episodes to go so we cant be knocking them off too soon my guess is theyre maybe a little infidelity hinted at as well

15 episodes for this show wow i wonder what else is going to come


bocs cinematography
i feel like they were cursed by the first movie since the ones that were there before were the ones that were seeing the ghost and phee white and i believe tan were the ones that werent there last time and didnt see anything so maybe the ones that were cursed were bringing back new people to the place for a sacrifice to non who is possessed by the spirit now like the story por was telling on the car ride up to the cabin well probably see more in the flashbacks since we know that the characters are acting creepy in a school setting
at least thats just my guess as to where it might be going


bocs cinematography
i love that this his horror first and bl second the location is gorgeous which is par for the course for be on cloud i want to live in this cabin ghosts and all the creepy shrines all around are just the icing on the cake i also like the practical effects it feels very oldschool horror as a true horror fan i was watching the background during that entire bj scene expecting something to pop out they left negative space around tas head which was excellent on the dp  the original friday the 13th did that a lot to great effect  when you leave negative space in a movie where you expect something to pop out all the time it creates tension with the audience especially when it doesnt happen but the tension isnt popped by a jump scare
i also like that the dynamics arent typically bl relationships where its meet and flirt and fall in love we already have an established couple and a couple with a messy history give me more bls and gls with established couples


in my villain era
right its hitting all the traditional horror tropes and im here for it im seeing it going a couple of ways in terms of plot but im gonna let them cook even if its predictable im just happy its an actual horror series


really liked your background info on framing and horror alot of people just think horror is a bunch of jump scares and opening medicine cabinets but done right horror can be absolutely haunting and beautiful
the last thai horrorblish series i watched was shadow which was a major letdown then i ended up rewatching remember 15 which was better but not blow your socks off
really really hoping this series takes the charge forward and blows expectations out of the water


bocs cinematography
jump scares can be effective if used right but most of the time they are used really wrong because they kill any mounted tension by making the audience laugh at themselves for getting caught if you use a jump scare and dont let it ramp down the tension but just as an extra layer of the rampup it puts you really on edge as an audience unfortunately repeated jump scares are the hallmark of bad horror movies
i think they used jump scares effectively here because the quick pop of the ghost or whatever didnt have any moment of relief where the character and viewer could go haha im just being stupid and go back to a normal heartrate
im also just glad to see a horror bl thats not vampires i mean i like vampires but im kinda sick of romantic vampires i want my vamps to be evil predators dammit


cause of death the heart killers 
here for it so here for it just to bring peace to some people the characters in the present day are in their 2nd year of uni so the nc scenes are among adults the cinematography is excellent as boc is wont to have and the kisses the kisses top tier i have the worst headache but i had to watch 


top tier ta learned everything from his bros at kp  i saw tas potential way back when  when he grabbed that back of the head i was sat down and locked in i am in for the long haul


cause of death the heart killers 
you have the bestest of eyes i saw fuaiz white in dont touch my gang and he was too cute im happy he got a proper bl role and is already blissed out with tee 
also im so down with phi and jin having already a backstory which will speed out the kisses and everything else 


hey huntress where did you get this information i am seeing conflicting reports


cause of death the heart killers 
so the characters are in uni in episode 1 fuaiz the actor who plays white who has an nc scene was 17 while filming but his scene is really well crafted so yeah you arr gonna see a 17year old actor kissing as a uni student


ive watched a lot of horror flicks and have to say this is the most generous killer ive ever seen lending a helping hand to the young lovers and leaving an injured and totally helpless victim for someone to come and rescue by the time he showed up on the road with the scooter boys i thought he was going to pop out with a spare tire like yall need a little help there


i guess with 15 episodes they need to draw it out a bit

sorry im late commenting but this has me cackling 

them being like reginas mom from mean girls 


i really liked jjfuaiz  they are lovely together were they already a thing in thc 
also good surprise from copper and also very pleased with ta 
how their relationships are normal is very healthy i loved it no question about homosexuality just normal relationship drama

all i can say is if the black shadowy hand is gonna be involved in sexy times i hope it doesnt end up like in shadow be a good angry spirit boyfriend for once


it has nails 

welp its not going into any hole anytime soon


the question is is that a supernatural entity or barcodes character non 
i mean can you imagine if our boy goes from  baby porchay must protect  to  evil vengeful threesome ghost  


okayi wanna watch but im a huge chicken how scary is this


in my villain era
i put timestamps in my post above its pretty on brand with any slasher movie


thank you maybe i watch thru my hands


i am a scaredy cat and never watch any horror things and i say it is kinda scary there are random jumpscares not too scary but a bit which makes your heartbeat go fast for a few secs


that was so much fun at least 50 camp i am not sure if they want me laughing at the places i laughed at but i dont really care are they really going to kill off one of their leads so soon looking forward to next week


 okay i was laughing at some scene too hehe i was worried it was ganna be too scary but they balanced it out 


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
oh no or yes another bl to add to my currentlywatched list


that jin guy reminds me of i cannot reach you lead kentaro maeda i didnt know he was paired with ta and us character almost dead in 1st ep this plot reminds me of grand guinoi japanese bl movie and barcode is ghost here i think it involves that cult its good 

lets gooo i love slashers and this is also a gay slasher wow


its very camp


daaamn i dont really like horrorthriller but watching for the kids and i already screamed my heart out at that one jumpscare moment with the motorcycle scene  idk how ill survive the next episodes but first episode was so crazy already 
i didnt expect that intro at all i actually didnt expect anything but the kids had really natural acting expressions i really laughed at the random funny lines istg im defo hooked at the story now and will be following 


be on cloud gives me bighit enthybe labelskpop company vibes im eager to see what theyre going to serve  i hope it has an interesting plot and horror that gives people goose bumps

love how we got right into the story in episode 1 with tons of things already happening wow both couples are  that tension between phee and jin and the looks they were giving each other were  i was definitely a little perplexed at the abrupt ending with the next episode preview playing right away also with the after credits with the deleted scene and behindthescenes clips i was wondering if i needed to watch to see any extra scenes lol
i am glad that they are not shying away at all from the horror aspect i cant wait to see how it will build every episode its interesting how the group is a mix of people who were present during the past incident and also people who have no idea who non is at all im looking forward to the flashbacks there are a lot of relationships to uncover i wonder if well get some more info on phee and tan since jin commented on those two having some kind of relationship


watch process of a scaredy cat
watch without sound subtitles only distractedly on the phone tilting the phone allows to see general shapes without being scared able to see steam and characters
watch without sound but with direct visuals just put sound for non scary scenes which we know about because first watch steamy steamy
watch completely and hide when you know what is coming so that only sound may be scary


as a fellow scaredy cat thank you for this advice going to do this going forward cus i literally watched half of this show with one eye open two hands over my eyes and face


 tell me if it works for you  the no sound really helped me remove part of the fright and there were obvious scenes where i was like nooope and tilted the screen away slightly



ghost black crispy hand crotch grab  half a butt in seconds watz the jumper cables for can a motorbike jump start a pick up trucknice try tho waiting for barcode

its giving american horror story the  grabbin ghoul hand still got me thinking over here

no bc they way i physically jumped when i saw that


yinwar lover and organic kiss connoisseur 
that phantom dicktouching hand was me btw


i must have watched a different show than everyone else cause i thought it was kinda awful at least scriptwise first introduce your characters then start the slashing lol i mean i barely know anyones name and honestly i dont really have any connection with any of them to really care this was all over the place imho at least the kissing scenes were pretty good boc knows how to do em 


in my villain era
you arent wrong but you pretty much just summed up the horror genre characters are pretty one dimensional and we get right into the slashing
you could start digging into the psychology of horror and how ultimately the audience often roots for the slasher but i think in this instance theyre just pulling on the traditional slasher tropes episode one reel them in and the background will start unfolding over the next episodes


horror movies usually lay the groundwork at the beginning usually with a killing or at least letting the audience have a peek at the upcomingshenanigans couldnt find a better word lol and then gives the audience time to know the characters this had lots of characters to introduce and was too fastpaced to really work as the introduction to a 12episode series im sure were gonna get to know everyone better eventually and hopefully they wont be one dimensional but my main issue is where do we go from here exactly when everyone already knows theres something creepy going on will everyone spend the rest of the show on fightorflight mode this was too much too soon imo but idk guess we gotta wait and see


in my villain era
my guess would be we they maybe going to tarantino this were staring with the end and then go back to the beginning especially with a 15 episode run


shut up you did not bring up my most favorite tarantino 


i hope its that and not a ton of flashbacks and sorry about the confusion re the episode count i was going off of what is listed on mdl


in my villain era
pffft mdl is full of lies iq lists the episode run which is always helpful

i think they started off this way because theyre going to do flashbacks etc and things may be calmer there so they wanted things fast and furious so to speak in this episode to get people hooked




earthmix 

isnt this a bit scary for a bl i mean it legit feels like horror movie and bl is just side of it wasnt expecting this to be the case ngl wheres my feel good vibes  

thats one episode down and 101215 depending on your source to go not sure i can stand all the hysterics each week gets tedious very quickly at least friday the 13th and all the other horror movies are over in two hours or less this feels like we will get all the sequels to them at once
cleveraliens208


so in my opinion thai horror is a hit or miss they either do real good at it ghost lab shutter or real bad most of the other horror things im holding out for this one though
i was real nervous about tee and top when they were on the moped thats for sure im really sad about us character not because im particularly fond of por hes real stupid but because i love us however he kinda got what he deserved for making stupid decisions lololol
all in all im so looking forward to this tbh i cant wait for the next episode


one thing i cannot stop thinking about is that phi ta white fuaiz and tan mio are all confirmed to have only transferred to the school in 12th grade  have not been there the last time the gang came to the house with non barcode we got plenty of scenes with phi  jin  tee kissing white in highschool uniforms though so im guessing its after the 1st cabin in the forest shenanigan so there will be at least 03 periods of time to be unraveled since thats the only way the storys gonna last for 12 eps imo
grade 1011 ish with non  meuk isnt meuk  non the same person he was the one in the mask choking top  was single out for being weird right  1st visit to the house to film the movie tee wore the killers costume here too jin seems close  protective of non kinda im curious about their dynamic here aside from their shared love of film making plus the way jin looked at non too lol there was some interest there definitively also some notable tension between tee  non 
grade 12  bloody toilet  haunted highschool halls non disappeared phiwhitetan transferred to the school  befriended w the gang tee  white dating  phi  jin hooking up  tan is hinted to have been involved somewhat so he might have had a crush on phi idk jin being obsessed with filming everything including him  phi hooking up at the school  i need to know how the scene w blood splattering on jins face while he slowly smiles like a maniac plays out  also im guessing perths character will play a part here
present days where the gang is in their 2nd year of uni its kinda suspicious that if so much bloody gory haunted shit has happened for the last 4 years of their life howwww are they so calm going back to where it all begined lol  it doesnt seem like their memories are altered since they still remember non will they start killing eo fluke w the gun  white slamming  a possessed  por  tee acting suspicious

uham i the only who thinks tas acting is weak he always has this up to mischief look even during the scene where he confronted jin abt their relationship

i havent finished the episode yet so i dont want to read through the whole thread but i am soooo curious so i will ask first and read after finishing the episode because i have a goldfish brain
does someone know how the film scenes like the blowjob  i mean i dont want to sound stupid but i am curious how they cover the front side if the backside is naked etc 


i dont know the specifics of dff but some possibilities i can think of
 use of doublesided tape
 guardmodesty garment eg sock
 onesided underwearthong
if people are comfortable its also possible for scenes to be filmed without covering
