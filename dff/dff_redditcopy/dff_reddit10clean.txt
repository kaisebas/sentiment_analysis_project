fr i admire his convictions and if a random innocent man had to die for that welp rip anyway stan tan and his d face while his fake friends kill each other

i love ta and jin and fluke but i was just rooting for tan the entire episode lol i can see everything from everyones side and put myself in everyones shoes  i can even see things from tops pov his uncle is a criminal hes poor like what is he supposed to do realistically i honestly dont even hate anyone in this cast or see anyone as a villain tho jjs tutor keng was fucking yikies af even tho theyre murderers and bullies but tan has my sword absolutely right now i was lowkey giddy when everything at the cabin was chaos and he was trying very hard not to smile fully in satisfaction my smart bb  lmao

in my villain era
well im not sure how i feel after todays episode we have 5 episodes left and today was the big reveal already jin got off way too lightly for the confession
im going to try and remain positive that they will stick the landing and we still havent solved the mystery of what happened to non so that is still a big question mark
im leaning into white having an agenda as well and hes going to be the one to get out of this
only one warning 2900min  shooting


cause of death the heart killers 
i think its only 12 episodes the final episode is being screened on march 8th
white seems shady indeed


in my villain era
ohhh it changed ok two more then not as bad thenbut was hoping theyd draw it out a little more


cause of death the heart killers 
me too but the pacing seems good next sammon will write just about us as viewers watcbing her series and it will be called trauma to where do i send my therapy bills 


in my villain era
i went to check the writing team and its not just sammon there are 4 of them with solid resumes im feeling better now we are in good hands

i think its only 2 episodes left final episode live screening is 8 march so 2 more weeks


cause of death the heart killers 
bump the actor that you are im in awe guys like weve been steadily growing this hostility towards his character but boy is he doing the most fear paranoia hatred fury he portrayed every aspect in an excellent way and i am impressed he stole this episode theres no two ways about it am i happy that top seems to be out well happy is a strong word but i wont be missing him tan is finally getting some answers but i dont think hes gonna like them my heart broke with whites when he learned about tees involvement in nons disappearance i still believe theres more to white and that preview is giving me hope also giving us hope for nons whereabouts the previews
one thing for sure im making peace with the fact that this series wont have a happy ending whatever happens the characters that survive are gonna need years of therapy i hope uthoughtsallday is planning accordingly


bocs cinematography
honestly i would love if this didnt have a happy ending its doing so much h stuff thats anathema to the bl formula and im living


cause of death the heart killers 
it would be iconic tbh 


same i dont think this should have a happy ending the story has had so many twists and turns up until now that i hope this continues until the end and we dont get a formulaic bl ending

thank you huntress  i bailed at ep7 and have watched only the nc and kissing scenes since then 
praying for all of you on the front lines 


cause of death the heart killers 
oh good i was worried you were watching





this time i will just say that i am sure we are being bamboozled
things dont fit the narrators are either lying or unreliable
the computers dont match
phee knows things he is not supposed to
phee says he is still nons boyfriend
jin still sees a bloody keng as a fear for no damn reasons
tan was on the couch with fluke and top when por was empaled he cannot have raised the branch last minute
and we know from the preview that tee is absolutely lying about non
there is a ninth person
we are being cleverly bamboozled we think we know because the characters admitted and we dont and only the next two episodes will properly shed light on everything
edit  just to precise that i am loving every second of it and tee was my favourite this episode


i hope youre right i really do im not gonna shut any of these down why would i my hope against hope is they throw us off completely and pull off an ending so surprising and unexpected
my fear is that none of this could be a red herring manipulation everything is face value it is what we showed you the writers lost their steam rounding 3rd base they dont stick the landing yay sports metaphors they dont catch me off guard and it goes exactly as anticipated
so after the show is over ill look back at it as a show that i spent way too much time on its potential was never full reached for me and its yet another thai bl that flubbed up its own ending
this is my ultimate fear for this show

this is my ultimate fear for this show
wait you need to be surprised by the ending for it to be good what lol
i think if everything ends with everything weve been shown being face value thats amazing and sticking the landing  the writing on this show so far has been great with so much obvious attention to detail character nuance and intention and i love that i think everything being what weve been shown at the end of the day would be a brilliant ending i love stunts and gags but m night shyamalan twists just to gag the girls can be so tired
like just have a pov and tell the story you want to tell the way you want to tell it and ill be down to clown if its interesting and done well and i think what dff has done so far has been amazing it reminds me of peeps that were disappointed with only friends and most of all mew because he wasnt diabolical like everyone imagined lol

i have a hard time believing that knowing the team of author on the show
the dedication to keeping the show and part of the cast under wraps
and the attention to details until now
but i am a glass half full king of person so we will see but all signs points to us getting deliciously bamboozled and since we already were before i mean episodes 14 were lacklustre until we had the flashback and then everything suddenly clicked marvellously i am confident it will be so again

i can understand phee falling in love but acting like it was nothing when jin confessed he upload the video dude wtf and wtf about wanting to help our friends you had to stop non from killing himself thanks to these friends
glad at least tan got his objetive and finally tee is talking i hope that knowing what happened jin and phee regretted what they did and start the crying
fluke has been awesome here i know he did what he did because the drugs but it was time to tell tee he is a bastard and rotten
white realizing the real colours of his boyfriend is heartbreaking but it was necessary
por and top who were two who most hurt non are out now its your time tee

i also was like hmmm that was a mild response when phee was like we both messed up i definitely was like yeah but in very different ways and then there was no discussion about the video and the fact that jin liked non as well and what have they are to each other now with the new details like i would be cracking skulls if someone did some revenge pon stuff like that to my boyfriend i know they were young but come on



phee you spineless loser there is no way that hole is so good that you can instantly be that chill and sprung for jin after finding out this is the guy who filmed and then circulated one of the most horrifying parts of your bfs trauma i know that this is a bl at the end of the day so they want to give the fans some cute romance but damn what a let down there was all that build up of jins nice guy sins just for a glossed over admission and a very repetitive and unnecessary goingincircles scene and some pandering romantic words set to sentimental music and then jin had the nerve to yell at tee while jin literally just stood there watching all this shit go down and no one calls him out on it the lowest point in the ep for me for sure i understand if phee thinks his yelling at non to go die is just as bad as jin posting his unrequited crushs dubcon sextape to the internet but theres no way that the writers think that right right lol i really hope the narrative punishes jin still even if phee wont
new they can never make me hate you any time the camera panned to his smiling at the pain he was causing i laughed too fuck those guys
tee give me hope for redemption he even had zuko makeup lol now this is the soul crushing guilt i expected to see from jin but never got idk if its the superior acting or writing or direction or just because the actor is tall so i got blinders on but im rooting for him to survive somehow hopefully next ep we can see how he put his money where his mouth is and actually helped non and if not rip to this hottie
fluke mvp got rid of annoying ass top got tee to confess and move this plot forward gave us more cute whimpering white he was so good he carried the ep for me i also love that the show is treating flukes doing nothing as he witnessed this bullying as just as bad as all the bullying that happened
ultimately i am trying to temper my expectations bc this is a bl but im still really hoping the narrative follows through on a satisfying ending if pheejin just walk off into the sunset holding hands no harm no foul then im going to hunt them down with an axe myself lol
excited for perth and more non and tee focus next ep love this series im hype for more


something makes me think fluke has definitely done more than weve seen hes been exceedingly passive but his reactions go beyong the drive to get to be a doctor and then there is white he may be innocent in the initial aspect but i still feel like hes a hidden factor may have even met non in what appears to be a brothel maybe heard the story and be there as another figure to help disrupt the group


idk if i agree about fluke i think his character exists as the friend who did nothing while this boy was bullied so terribly and thats enough for the guilt to eat away at him and cause these excessive reactions i hope youre right about white


omg i had the same feeling about jin oh yes so i filmed non and posted it online and ruined nons life and his family reputation but oh well things happen
jin had lots of attitude talking to phee and new and im sorry the only thing jin does is talking and no action
i really hope they dont feed us with a pheejin ending couple cause i will be forever mad


jins attempt at action is so surface level which i actually loved about him i liked that all he did was go guys thats not cool  a couple times then continued to pull non into his friends shitty web he knew how terribly non was being treated and continued to tempt and encourage him to hang out with them repeatedly just because he was selfish and sprung and wanted non for himself i liked that he was vengeful and bitter and awful when non was being preyed upon by the teacher and then this guy stays friends with these assholes for three more years genuinely enjoyed all these character driven bad choices because i thought the story would give him his comeuppance and it mirrored flukes similar stoodthereandwatched story
but now with phee getting lost in the sauce and openly doting on him and how everyone seems to express their guilt and remorse way more intensely than jin did in his one scene of admitting his sins i am losing hope that jin is going to get what he deserves i want to trust the writers but idk its a shame because jins character would be way more interesting without the main ship plot armor


i agree with everything you said i live jin and fluke basically mirroring each other but fluke is aware of his inactions and jin belive he is the good guy and did nothing wrong i would have loved it if jin till the end stayed delusional about his level of involvement but i cant shake the feeling that they are gonna make pheejin the endgame



this is kind of how i feel about him too in the flashback scenes jin gave me the feeling of a spider drawing non into an inescapable web despite having feelings for non he not only failed to protect him from his toxic friend group but encouraged him and dragged him into their schemes a huge difference from my personal weatherman where the two leads met under similar circumstances  yoh was a social outcast who was seen as a creep for staring at people and drawing pictures of them mizuki deliberately walked away from his friends whod been gossiping about him to befriend yoh directly  which is what jin should have done if he cared about nons wellbeing his veneer of niceness is like a paperthin balm over their rot making him as culpable as the rest of them even if his intentions werent malicious in a way he reminds me of a siren luring non with promises of friendship acceptance and belonging to satisfy his own selfish wants as sirens in the myths tempted sailors with their deepest desires he tempts non with his desire to be part of an inner circle rather than an outsider but he doesnt back up those promises leading non into ruin
while there might be cultural differences between thailand and the countries where international audiences reside regarding the laws and perception around distributing child pornography filming underage revenge porn with the intent to circulate it on the internet is a serious offense the devastating impact of revenge porn and sextortion scams have caused many teenagers and even grown adults to take their own lives when he filmed and uploaded the video to a server he was thinking only of himself and his own feelings of pain heartbreak and betrayal considering how its been handled in this show and his role in an established bl pair i dont think jin will face any narrative payback for his actions but i think it highlights his character as someone who finds it easier to be nice than to be kind unlike flukes silent complicity he has a conscience and the instinct to do whats right but he consistently retreats into maintaining the status quo he is essentially a coward and says as much in episode 1 when phee accuses him of running away from his problems in episode 8 fluke pointedly asks jin as non is being taken away are you going to stop him in that moment hes being asked if he can rise to the occasion which he doesnt i hope in the final two episodes hell stand up for somebody for real instead of just asking his friends not to call non mean names i agree that without the inevitable bl happy ending hed be a much more interesting character


ugh love how you described the state of things its so true i havent watched mpw yet but heavy yes  if jin really felt bad he would have dropped those friends dude stuck with them for years even after they bullied the shit out of non
i do hope jin is able to rise the occasion i just dont see right now how that would absolve him of uploading non con porn lol i have am trying to remain hopeful though

100 all of this


rwrb ofc bmftms
basically jin behaved like a nice guy he always tried to be nice to non as well as integrate him into the group but when he felt betrayed his first impulse was to leak an erotic video


does anybody see some similarities between tannew and hamlet theyre both haunted by ghosts real or imagined burdened by grief and driven to seek revenge for the death of a family member but rather than killing their targets directly they plan to extract a confession by orchestrating an elaborate playwithinaplay tannews decision to hide his return from england from his parents and shoulder his burdens by himself mirrors nons decision to hide his massive debt from phee and hamlets decision to feign madness alone  this isolation inadvertently leads to the deaths of their loved ones compounding their grief and trauma he seems to be teetering on the edge of sanity and the willingness to live reminiscent of hamlets struggle with suicidal thoughts and mental instability we dont know if hes actually committed murder yet but if his reaction to top being shot is any indication he doesnt care about collateral damage can new become the person he once was or is he doomed to die as tan ultimately hamlet ends in a bloodbath emphasizing the cyclical nature of revenge and violence with two sons dead a family torn apart and pors family likely to seek retribution its hard to imagine that the survivors lives would return to normal again 
since the woods featured more prominently in this episode and it does seems like theres someone following phee and jin among those trees i was also thinking if they serve as a means to seek justice for the marginalized in this show if boxlike buildings and geometric structures represent societal institutions trapping and oppressing people at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid like non and his family then the uninhabited woods could offer a path to justice denied to them by the police or the courts it might symbolize a space for the aggrieved and the wronged where the accumulation of material wealth has no power
this episode was slowpaced and felt a bit like filler but i guess it was a chance to pause and breathe after the revelations of the past couple episodes kudos to bump and jjay for completely owning their scenes especially considering theyre rookie actors cant wait for the next episode to reveal whites backstory well find out if hes going to be the final girl after all


honestly at this point no one can piss me off more than jin the way he talked to phee before his confession and then talking to tan the attitude and entitlement
he really doesnt feel guilty or anything about whatever he done to non its all just lipservice and it doesnt matter at least fluke the forever bystander is feeling a smidge in concise
i really enjoyed flukes acting this episode

why am i not binging it after it ends why i need to wait another week for the next episode
i cant even describe how i love this show its so good well made exciting so many plot twists man im telling you i will be recommending this show like i did with kinnporsche what an masterpiece everyone should watch that its really incredible
im glad well see more of perth in the next episode i wonder what his role is little whitey is not a good guy how surprising in reality non will be the final boy d
edit i also cant believe a boring piece of crap like fricking playboyy the series has 14 episodes and a show with an amazing writing and great characters only 12 just a random thought


i feel like this episode painted tannew into such a one dimensional character and im not sure if im willing to believe it i feel like theyre trying to trick us and i honestly am more intrigued than ever before really pissed off at phee but i feel like thats intentional as well i will say though im gonna be eternally pissed off if pheejin are endgame  thats all


ill be disappointed too at this point it doesnt feel right to be endgame and happy if a couple is to end up together id prefer pheenon and theyre scheming together


cause of death the heart killers 
im reloading that webpage like a madwoman 

bump and jj really carried this episode bump the most were getting the backstory and everything is being woven together there is another time jump back but it was marked this time lol idk i dont have as many thoughts this episode theres more answers finally but theres still some big questions about nons whereabouts and what the endgame is
in the preview we see more perth and white and thats exciting to see how they play into the mix phee wasnt hard on jin at all but idk maybe its cause they both have blame here getting to the end


yooooo i was happy clapping each time someone else freaked out let them all get hurt or die i dont care  i dont know why phee is suddenly not on board with that  police wont do anything anyways so get the information take revenge and leave xd
anyways white is up to sth as well right
also non still alive huh but to get money 

well i figured that phee wouldnt be part of the whole murdering part of the plan but its good to have confirmation that tannew did go rogue on his own
hmmm im kinda of 2 minds about phee spilling the beans to jin and then forgiving so quickly when jin confessed to being the one who posted the video on the one hand i feel like they should both be waaay more upset with each other phee lied about his motivations for joining their friend group and getting close to jin for 3 fucking years meanwhile jin posted literal child pornography of phees first love which was the nail in the coffin for nons entire life collapsing phee is complicit in the deaths that happen at that house and jin is complicit in nons disappearance as well as nons parents committing suicide on the other hand while its inarguable here that jin triggered a cascade with devastating consequences mental health is not that cutanddry and they could have already been down that path with or without the video leaking so its not fair to blame one person for someones suicide and the gang uncle wanted to shut non up well before the video leaked so his disappearance was largely inevitable and the video just gave them a convenient coverup excuse theyve both also had 3 years to stew in their own shame and selfblame so it is understandable how that might make them feel like blaming each other less
interesting how tannew tries to stoke a confession out of someone by bringing up how this is like nons movie but white is the one who brings up drugs and hallucination i really gotta know what role he has to play in all of this maybe hes been a mole from the gambling gang the whole time planted at tees side to make sure he doesnt betray them or try to dig into what happened to non or my previous theory about him having gotten close to the gang to find out what happened to keng bc he was also groomed and raped by him could still hold up
man that rope on top is so freaking loose and hes so crazed im surprised he hasnt just hulkripped out of it lol tho i will say as much as i hated top as a character and jets screamshout performance as him this version where theres a chemically induced reason for him to act deranged is really welldone im sorry for ragging on you earlier jet please play insanely unhinged characters more often bc i think thats your strong suit however one last note no one dies from a gut shot that quickly you could have agonized a bit more instead of almost immediately collapsing tbf that could have been just how u were directed or they edited out a chunk of the dying process
ngl i was mad worried that fluke would end up shooting tee before he could finally confess goodriddance to top ive come around to the actor but the character is a garbage human who deserved to die
hold up i thought keng got hit by a car hes still kickin hmmmm i wonder if the longhaired goon ended up having a soft spot for non and letting him go or maybe non somehow escaped and he lied about it to the boss to cover his ass
tee you lying idiot what the fuck do you mean your uncle betrayed you and you didnt know what would happen to non you threatened non yourself with organ harvesting and death if he tried to rat out their money laundering scheme
oof white looks genuinely heartbroken to find out the kind of person tee really is
oooooh ok from the preview maybe tee really did try to help non escape his uncles clutches seems like he didnt go straight to organ harvestingoh no what if by sell parts they mean prostitution maybe tee was setting up to try to buy nons freedom but his uncle decided it was too much of a risk and killed non anyways fuuuuck the horrors of nons life really never end oooo but what if white actually met non first while he was being held captive by the gang and he decided to go on a similar revenge mission as tannew bc non was his first love too ok that actually wouldnt make much sense bc non was cute but he couldnt have managed to get 3 seperate boys all falling for him at once and would be silly writing to repeat tannews motivation in a completely unrelated character but a girl can dream eh
pretty short ep not really filler but definitely a break from the action and mystery to let the characters confess and breath which i think was needed as a sort of buffer between the buildup of eps 19 and the endgame of the last 2 we got a lot of necessary setup but it still maintained the tension which is pretty impressive tbh i wonder if well find out next ep for sure what nons final fate is im betting theyll save it for the finale

finally a smart comment about phijin thanks

tbh while im living for the subtlety in the characters for the most part i kind of wish there was less nuance and they could just be mad at each other i understand why time and guilt has tempered it but i wanted to see them feel that rage and disgust at each others wrong doings


they could still be selling organs could be they sold kengs organs first since he was already injured by the car considering the preview show non bruised and injured could be that the gang was in the middle of selling his organ part by part



bocs cinematography
 so nobody else caught that someone else was marking the trees and them going in circles was probably on purpose phee didnt have a very big reaction about that video confession hes been fairly stoic but he also dropped the axe outside the house and his explanation of new setting the traps did not answer for the knife wounds on pors arms as well as the impalement phee was leading jin around on purpose and his demeanor totally changed when he said i will protect you what if he was talking to non and not jin and non was out in the woods too and they are in this together the whole time there is still the other mask that was wearing the black shoes that attacked them in the graveyard
 god jjay fucking killed it this episode tees always been my fave character and this just cemented it hes so complicated i felt tees heart break when whites view of him changed whatever else he is tee loves white genuinely when i rewatched tee and whites sex scenes for science after tee looked at white he had this desperate look on his face i also believe that he probably killed his uncle
 fluke also is so fascinating the bystander is now the only active murderer of the gang that we know of  we only have phees word on the new stuff bitch your hands are dirty  you aint no bystander anymore
 news glee at tops death was everything this man is going to have a wild ride on his next turn on the karmic wheel
 some of the things that white said to tee were very hmmmmmm he said that tee promised he wouldnt be testy just like tee said white promised he would be obedient and then said you said you wanted to be friends with these people which is an odd phrasing in a show where nothing seems like an accident and wherever white was in that preview was not a friendly upstanding place
 okay wild theory time  what if white buys one of nons organs non has to pay off his debt that can either mean sex trafficking or it could mean organ harvesting which is something that has even been mentioned before by tee what if whites fear of being sick has to do with that and hes black market buying a desperate persons organs or he could just be some fucked up rich person who likes to pay to hurt desperate poor people the other mask in the black shoes has crutches what if non is maimed somehow


i saw the marks were different but i thought it was oversight but it bothered me how off the scene felt and how underwhelmed i felt by phees actionsreactions this whole episode leaving behind the axe really bugged me too im like how has he gotten so stupid
if the long con is still at play praying new is apart of this too and if its a big scheme with multiple players ill eat my words take back every single even slightly negative thing ive posted and i will forever be this shows bitch i swear like i hated this episode
so heres 


i think phee knows theres another person there hes leading jin back to the house but leading him in circles until he gets the mark from the person in the woods that its time to go back the plan has always been to get them to kill each other in the house so now that jin has confessed phee is taking him back he probably did want to spare jin because he did seem the nicest of the friends but now hes being led in phee left the axe for the 9th person to pick up


this is what i hope for sure and i can see it i definitely picture the 9th being non and i can see phee after jins reveal being actually surprised by it and not wanting it to be true but then he knows hes gotta bring jin back into the chaos and whatever happens happens
new is definitely getting his wish bc he wanted them to turn on and eat each other the og five are all made of weak stuff for sure jury is still out on jins ending for me though


bocs cinematography
i am so fucking pissed that i have to work and cant watch this for a few hours

that axe phee dropped will probably come in to play later right  the way the camera lingered on it would suggest so
after rewatching the first four episodes im convinced that phee either purposely lied to jin or that hes just wrong about what happened putting this under a spoiler tag for people who wanna go back and rewatch do it  its fun
there are scenes in the first two episodes where the masked killer is using crutches


bocs cinematography
im also convinced that the axe will come back i think phee dropped it on purpose and there was someone else non in the woods with them marking the trees to purposely discombobulate jin and the crutch mask also had black shoes where top had white shoes there were two masks

also something else that made me go  in my rewatch especially in episode 1 are the scenes between the phee and white
i might be reading to much into this but when theyre making the movie phee acts as the director and white is his actor the directoractor thing is emphasized phee i believe were told as studying to become a film director and later when tee scolds white i thought we agreed that youd be nice if i brought you here youd be obedient white answers im obidient and one more thing its just acting
theres also a moment early in the first episode where having just watched the short film they made phee nods to white when tan asks why they havent introduced them to non then phee nods to white again when white says something that convinces tee to agree to shoot a new short film
also also and sorry for the rambling but isnt white shown wearing the same type of school uniform as phee in one of the flashbacks


most of the stuff about tannew that phee said to jin is just what he thinks happened since he believe the only person who could do it is tan it is entirely possible that the person who killed uncle deng is someone else


this ep went by fast for me and felt almost fillery probably because there were a lot of explanatory flashbacks and reveals that most viewers had already knownassumed so it was a matter of just bringing all the other characters up to speed
i think jins confession about what he did to non felt downplayed and seemed like they just wanted to get that out of the way to push forward with pheejin which i get bc theyre the stars of this bl but idk if i could be with someone who did revenge porn also was there a point to having them going in circles i was hoping it was a set up for something intentional but nope just several minutes of being lost honestly thought they couldve had just the dialogue of phee reassuring jin and immediately cut to them finding their way out the woods
fluke is absolutely unhinged his role as the bystander during nons abuse is finally catching up to him and hes consumed by the guilt and frustration of it all the actor is played the scenes really well and is top actually dead im not a doctor but it seems like he was shot closer to his lower abdomen than stomach and could potentially live if he was treated or i guess im supposed suspend my disbelief and assume a single bullet got him which im not mad about either 
so based on the flashbacks and ep preview it looks like non was made to work at a casino to pay off his debt and maybe he meets white whose motivesconnections with the whole group still arent entirely clear if they keep showing non alive in these flashbacks could they be teasing that hes still alive part of me thinks no because if he has to endure that kind of hardship with nothing left to lose then a second suicide attempt wouldnt be out of character for him i would love to be wrong though
2 episodes left and i still have so many questions


yeah something is definitely up even if theyre agreeing new is out of his mind both phee and jin have reasons to distrust the other extremely but are still ok phee tells him that theyd planned his whole thing out to drug them admits that getting involved with jin was because he was the easy target and then distanced after fking only to bring them into this situation jin admits to recording and posting the video out of jealousy and a onesided crush which definitely accelerated nons descent  disappearanceyet they still can work together i actually thought phee was going to try and attack him with the ax
i feel deeply that there is more to flukes actions than just guilt for being a bystanderpassive participant even his obsession with getting into school isnt holding up because now with 2 definitely dead and 1 severely injured he cant think this will just vanish
im also holding out that this is a plot by non simply given how he rewrote that script he may attempt suicide again but i feel hed want revenge first on at least tee whos actions despite him feeling remorse now were the ones that pushed non the furthest on this path


phee is an asshole he can go eat shit how can he just forget what jin did to non like non is not a saint but hes the victim here like what is going on in his head did he just forget what happened to non did he hit something and what happened to tannew plan like wtf

this felt like a filler episode atleast another person died though i wasnt surprised that fluke pulled the trigger i knew he was going to kill someone due to his paranoia 
the pheejin confession was a little anticlimactic but if they are actually endgame then i guess it makes sense
i cant help but feel like we are headed towards a phee vs tan showdown and a jin vs nonalive showdown



so anti climatic i didnt like that they were just ok with the reveals like bbs its ok to feel a certain way about people doing bad things that affect you even if you feel you dont have a right to feel this
phee was an accomplice to a person that drugged jin and he remained complicit like jin couldve died from this jin posted a sex video of phees thenboyfriend which led to his down spiral amongst many other things that shouldve never happened to non non couldve died just from this committed suicide successfully
i never wanted this scene to happen in the first place but i hope phee is lying and luring jin into a false sense of security like hes assumingtelling very specific things that he shouldnt know like how was he able to put 2 and 2 together in such a specific way
now do i like pheejin sure do i think they have chemistry absolutely do i need them to be endgame hell no i dont
edit i forgot jin lied to the police about non which ill assume phee already knew about anyway he knows they all gave statements mightve even read them

im pretty convinced that phee isnt out for revenge killing at this point he just wanted answers for what happened to non initially his lust for jin got in the way and now he actually has feelings for jin i think either they die together or survive together  


this has been my thinking since the team up in episode 8 i still think this but things did not add up today with phee how did he flip his script so fast why did he refer to these assholes as friends this was so shocking to me why does he still call non his boyfriend how does he place the axe on the ground and seconds later he forgets to pick it up again how in the world is he revealing so many specific things about new in his confession when he wasnt present for most of this theyre really specific assumptions on his part
finally the scene in the woods is so noticeably weird does he have zero sense of direction hes the one leading and he keeps leading them in circles like three different times and the marks on the tree are never the same what was this scene
the more i hone in on it the weirder i feel about these things also how does jin know tans real name again do i have to make another assumption

hey maybe they are playing an uno reverse card on us its either that or  the writing may have just gotten messy or translations were dodgy 


i immenssely agree with you i dont want pheejin as endgame but they do have great chemistry but hell no i dont want them as endgame after what jin did to poor non


we kinda needed an episode where they all found out about new so i can forgive them 

im so damn curious about where they are going with this because it feels way too early for us to have some of this information so either theyre kind of fumbling the ending possible or there are more surprises and twists in store for us that were not expecting
todays ep actually gave me exactly what i was hoping  phee and jin talking to each other and seeing how their situations parallel  which of course means that im now highly suspicious of it haha is phee being genuine is jin being genuine i wonder
im kind of sad at all the anger towards phee because im actually kind of adoring that theyre subverting the usual expectations towards horror everyone and their dog thought that phee was out for revenge after ep 6 so i love the fact that instead the show went actually well have to see how it plays out im still kind of wondering if one or both of them is fooling the other
another possibility is that what they think happened is just not the case this is mainly towards phee  im really curious if hes setting tan up or even jin is it possible that hes the one at fault i dont know
at any rate im really curious to see the backstory play out more in the next ep and to finally get some answers on who perth is and what happened to non after we last saw him

i dont have iqiyi so i have to wait till tomorrow to watch the new episode 


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
i am a little more suss about phee after watching this episode its a pretty common horror trope for one character to tell another character all the horrible things the villain has done and then for there to be a reveal that actually the teller was behind everything its one of those things that i dont think theyre going to reveal that he was actually the one to kill por and uncle deng but if they did it would make sense to me
jins confession was pretty glossed over but i also think that right now phees focus is getting them both out alive since hes realizing how far off the deep end tan has gone i can totally buy him compartmentalizing that right now because he cant really react the way he would if they were not literally fighting for their lives


ray has done nothing wrong in his life ever
also me when top got shot and probably died



tannew is an evil geniuswhats crazier and scarier is an evil genius hell bent on revenge with nothing to loosephee why you got cold feet all of a sudden and spilled the teayou knew whats at stakeyou knew going in what tannew is capable ofso mr keng was sold for organ trafficking while non i presumed is in slave labor somewheretannew carry ongive your brother justicewhat of white am surehe is not that innocent



i dont understand how an episode can be so action packed and yet be filler at the same time  like what was this episode it was 35 minutes and were in the home stretch now grrrr
this is a rant
what was the whole pheejin walking in an endless circle in the woods stuff i get its to heighten a sense of foreboding and paranoia about where they are in relation to this cult but its just filler and they make it out in no time anyway therefore i dont care sorry not sorry also im real tired of jin just yelling at people particularly phee
my boy is trying whatre you doing whatve you done
also the shows strengths are in the complexity of its characters and the actions they specifically takedont take that affect other characters this drives the plot forward not supernatural elements that get thrown in here and there to keep a certain element alive in the series
last thing its already been established that the drugs are the source of the pandemonium soooyeah for me its not horrorsupernatural never has been i just find it dumb and distracting and it takes me out of the show this particular thing has always bugged me especially now that were near the endgame 
edit can anyone explain to me the point of fluke calling out tee on the leaked video in episode 4 but jin states hes responsible for all of it in this episode i hope this isnt a misfire

yeah im gonna admit that the drugs annoyed me and i would have preferred supernatural but this show is really a psychological thrillermystery so ive made peace with it 


 this made me lol cause im exactly the opposite i prefer the drugs over the supernatural so i still get my way i guess but the shows not over yet cause i never bought into it at all
and when itll kind of pop up herethere i get annoyed so i havent made peace with this aspect 
im like show you are a suspensepsychological thriller bl so can we let go of this other part and push forward without filler please

ijbol every f time tan grins like a little shit

ugh this episode was too short tbh this felt like a filler episode other than top getting killed and tan jumping the shark there was little story progression and we only have 2 episodes left
finally we have another death were way too far into the series to have only one main character being killed
i was gagged to find out that tan purposefully orchestrated the deaths of por and the uncle he has truly gone off the deep end im so excited for the inevitable showdown he will have with phee at the end
they have been ramping up the romance angle for phee and jin at first i was doubtful their love story would survive till the end but i guess the producers realize that this show is still a bl and we have to have some romance to root for
poor white i truly have no idea what his fate holds at the end of this series either he will be a casualty of tees actions or hell be the final girl theres no in between


we still dont know if it was tannew phee said he thought it was newtan


yeah youd think phee would have done more to put a stop to things the second he found out that new was killing people highly suspicious that he did nothing after a gruesome beheading of an innocent man has anyone checked his pockets for concertina wire

you know what  i just hate everyone in this series  they better all die no survivor no happy ending
just let them all die 

im not sure what to make of this episode im hoping that phee is just a bad narrator and we dont really know what has happened yet its too easy to all be tannew i still think there is another person involved and they are probably going to get that axe phee conviently forgot about
the pheejin confession and jin confronting tan all felt a bit underwhelming and short they heard the information and just moved on to the next thing im hoping phee is just in survival mode as i could have slapped him when he said lets go save our friends
next week looks promising finally some teewhite answers white seems to be at the uncles place does he help non here it was hard seeing them hurt non on the rooftop


wait i missed that he said our friends no no nooooo i guess i hated the whole scene so much that i only half payed attention
thats some jump the shark material right there i cant watch that cause i dont want to  in my mouth
the math aint mathin for me on this he has to be bullshitting right right
that is a very specific betrayal to non and i cant justify this at all if it isnt addressed like wtf phee


bocs cinematography
phees reactions are strange  there is definitely more to it than that ta once described phee as a manipulative character he should have been angrier about the confession of the video release considering how it blew everything up and the way his demeanor in the woods suddenly changed when he said i will protect you i dont think he was talking to jin they werent alone in those woods

i agree he had me very confused this episode i think he knows more than hes letting on as soon as jin confessed he conviently found an axe to escape and he knew full well about drinks being drugged but gave jin that bottle of water i find it hard to accept that after everything he wants to protect that group
i have a feeling pors hallucination of non was real as well was tan not in the house


bocs cinematography
yeah he was in the living room with top and fluke
idk phee seems like once jin confessed phee instead of trying to leave it was like we got to help our friends who really is a friend i think he told him to see if he had anything to do with non he didnt even get mad when jin confessed to video and uploaded it


well to me it seemed like phee was never that much invested in revenge plan and it showed it here he literally didnt care that jin filmed and posted the video online like it was nothing


with all the twists that have been coming up i wouldnt be surprised if this is all nons plot he does have reason to be pissed at them all and he was clearly spiraling before disappearing the only one he wouldnt really have been aware of at that time would be jins actions but otherwise hed have some anger to them al including family mom clearly was picking favorites and not very supportive dad was much like jin in relative passiveness and hes probably be jealous of new based on moms treatment phee abandoned him after the vid white is the only innocent bystander for now at least

i think jin upload the viedo  


the preview looks very promising we are gonna get tons of answers


jins and phees suprisingly mild reactions to each other were interesting jin is definitely giving off vibes might not be right in the head


why on earth is phee still being so sweet to him after knowing the shit he has done also jin should be more upset knowing phee was just using him to know what happened to his bf


its true when they say the most dangerous man is the one who has nothing to lose tan really has become my favourite character


i literally watched the entire series rn just the last episode is ending i feel like everyone is so bad that u cannot justify anyone other than phee like he did so much for non telling his dad that he was part of scandal i honestly blame top and tee for all this since there were the ones who broke that camera and framed nom ig it wasnt for that movie or anything i feel like non would have just exchanged his school and also the fact that tannew is just so heartbroken its so sad i feel the like only character that would be given a lil bit of sympathy would be jin ofcno amount of hurt can make u leak a video like that but still he was hurt and non on the other hand was cheating on phee who was nothing but good to him always


nons entire family is less a family of people and more a collection of plot points the show peaked in its first 4 episodes i cant believe im saying this about a show written by the same woman who wrote manner of death and triage

ive watched this show with a lot of fast forwarding all of the horror scenes and the bullying scenes so i know nothing about fluke because up to this point hes seemed completely pointless i know all of the others i know their names and their roles in the bullying the filming etc but fluke seemed to just be there and now hes centre stage which is interesting
