tik tok had me so worried that this series was gonna be so bad they were so wrong tho its amazing the storyline the characters everything was just perfect and the ending too i absolutely love the way the series ended i need another season to this asap cuz what
i loved this series so much im gonna miss them ttt
this is heart breaking 
i think the ending is implying that everyone died in the house the only thing i found disappointing is that poor white died he was so innocent on in all of this i have to say i dont blame new if someone destroyed my family like they did i would want revenge as well
questo bl thai totalmente diverso dagli altri mi ha entusiasmato vederlo mi  dispiaciuto tanto per non voleva solo essere amico di quei ragazzi ma loro lhanno ingannato ed  morto gli attori molto bravi soprattutto il personaggio di non fantastico lo consiglio
this series is really damn good and the story awesome the actors and we have seen them in other dramas have grown with their acting skills are great recommend it 
me here waiting for the final episode then was like wtf after reading the comments still hopping there is season 2
barcodes acting is soooo good 
sweet adorable  loving teewhite relationship
its open ending so thier is a season 2
i dont know why people are hating phee for me phee is doing right and to think non and phee is broken up a long time a go if you got criticize means you portray the character well
wow props to the whole team the actors did a fantastic job i knew not everyone would like the ending but i did i love a mystery maybe a season 2 please boc make it happen 
loved most of it the actors and all the crew did fabulous it was a bit too gruesomely bloody for my taste in episodes 12 im severely disappointed in the ending wheres the happy ending
yun na yun
maybe theres another ending instore 
sweet tragic heartbreaking
im not ready for this to be over 
what was that ending why did white have to die he did nothing 
thats the ending naurrr
its smooookieeeeemuch respect crewthis ep you nailed itsalute and much respect codeyou deserve the indeed you will harvest what you sow
that ending with phee and jin im totally at a loss now
im so sad rn
this series is so intense i took a break last week and i come back and is back to my stomach in my throat one more episode my gosh boc is out here changing the game 
watdaaaa  thats it  i dont know i feel contented but not so  i cant describe 
was this the last episode
what ano nangyari bat feeling ko bitin
are they still hallucinating or dead
wow esta serie me toco todas mis emociones algo diferente de un bl estoy orgullosa de boc y todos que hicieron esta serie y los chicos que talentosos son todos
best boc show by far
lmao the behind scenes have me too tickled barcode hey non non lmao the ending was good my villainous azz giggled with glee at everyones hallucinations and demise the crazy thing is well never know how it truly ended theyre all still in that house
the most bizarre show ive ever seen
omg why white my heart hurts so bad for him he had nothing to do with anything
what the heck that ending sucked
erm disappointed
wow that ending lmao
    
where is episode 12 
omg this show is unbelievable 1010 from me one episode to go cant wait and thank you thai actors and production team for this amazing series and thank you iqiyi for airing this everybody watch this
when will the finale be released here
as per me i think everyone is to blame from the parents friends brother to the boyfriend except for white but am not surecant stop it hurts
you know the biggest surprise for me is that tee actually had a conscience but it kicked in wayyyyyyyy too late but i do feel bad for tees situation however still doesnt justify anything he did to non
non didnt deserve all that
heh i am in love with how we all blame who for this and that actually this is an unfortunate twist drama but i love it yet i think everyone has their own fault for everything that happened so far including non he let things happen to him and keep going with things
 writing was important enough to him that he was willing to endure all of that to get his foot in the door so to speak which his what he saw this contest as
yessss exactly i wouldve given up on trying to please the por and the rest a long time ago he kept on trying and it led to this not that i put a tenth of the blame on him theres still a little it was tee top and fluke who chose to be horrible people to begin with
when he knew how everyone wasjust saying though  by the way i am really enjoying this very much 
what if all that happened was a one big hallucination tan smoke the cure to wake them all up from it that is why they all faint what if
 this has been my thought from the beginning after watching grand guignol last summer i am hoping we are right 
 how im praying your version is right that would seriously be cool
what if the entire show was nons script to begin with this entire thing was the film they where making non is alive and they are all actually friends and the hidden character is just that a fake film that was written for the real script
it was so difficult to finish i feel sad for non
how did everyone get a affected by the laced cigarette except the person whose actually smoking it make it make sense lol and why did phee just stand there and inhale it when he knows whats in it silly rabbit
maybe he had built up a tolerance who knows
dammmmmmmm teeeeee this all ur fault but i feel bad for u which is crazy
also miobump in the back being all lovey dovey always steal my attention
the way theyre reacting to teewhite scenes sameee tho sameee
i love everyones performance in dff especially mio athens performance hope to see athen more in the future projects 
last ep guilt will kill them all
will white take wrath of new
nong barcode is becoming a great actor esp in drama
disappointed by the series shifting from promised romance and suspense to heavy social drama focusing on systemic failures in education system police and social care really wish to see ta and maybe copper in a true romance bl
lol this series never promised a romance have you been watching since ep 1 when was a romance promised this had dark twisted from the get go
its not focusing on that at all but if thats what you take from it then go ahead
omg the stress this series is so good im so happy we got to see how tee and white met i officially only feel bad for white and non the rest can just go die 
i feel bad for tannew his entire family died from the cruel actions of the group
one thing i have to say is the actor who plays phee has beautiful eyes now wth non is alive i almost cried when i thought he diednow in the next episode he is alivethis show keeps you on the edge of your seat
i think it was a hallucination
phee wants to find out truth what happened to non and wants justice for him phee really hope you not do any mistakes feel sorry for tan he lost his family and still not find non he has nothing left but theres way to get revenge white change tee but feel he has something
next ep get me  non hope you alive and it just phee dream or imagination hope everything solve nonnew and im still pheejin
okay tee and white are sweet together
the adults really failed these kids
facts i havent found 1 likable adult in this entire series
i guess moral of the story is everyone has equal blame and guilti partially called thistee harbored closested emotions for nonso far im loving the twist and turns great job beyond the clouds 
tees side story is just so heartbreaking this series got lots of twists
i want new to kill most of them just let white live and just shoot pee in the shoulder or something
raikantopeni i know there is this competition about pheenon and pheejinbt guys can we jst go with the flow of the series plzwe all know in reality fan service its jeffcode and tacopper this will never change so stop the competition and enjoy this thrilling twist series
 have commented in peace no need for harsh comments if you found my comment harsh to you then am sorry
no one oa talking about the actors were going off the characters the series presented its fine of we debate and discuss a series its what makes it fun if youre bothered by the comments then dont read them i love jeffcode and tacopper
am i the only one who legit has tears because of non my feelings are hurt
youre not alone i really had hope that non would be ok
i will leave this place i am not a loser i am hurting for non that poor sweet baby was put through hell for no reason i truly sympathize with the character i was actually quite annoyed with getting the back story of tee and white i want justice for non
tee has me over here in my feels
white is so adorable
be on cloud really out did themselves with this show way better than kp
be on cloud really out did themselves with this show way better than kp
arghh
im still lost her once again 
man gotta wait till next week this episode focused alot in tee smh lot a back story but damn
no tee no more home for non coz what you did for him is he already died even your life cant pay for it poor non justice for him
holy  the twists  turns keep on coming the emotions that switch on me with tee is crazy his backstory  his relationship with white is  its beyond shtty what he to non but he did his very best to change  resolve what happened next episode looks awesomecant wait
