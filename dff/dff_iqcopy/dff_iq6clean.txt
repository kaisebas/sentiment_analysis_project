ohmygod wait is he nons brother
510 anyone know what jin is posting in the live comments
why is barcode so chill
excellent well done to the directors and actors 1010
im on episode 6 and i dont know if i can continue the level of bullying in this has me so upset non just wanted to belong and have friends por tee and want to be famous have me sick to my stomach i dont know if im going to finish this series thank you jin for caring
yeah i was bullied pretty hard as a kid and some of this stuff is really triggering some of the scenes i had to take my headphones off and just read the subtitles because that helped get me handle it im still interested in the show though
not jin watching kinnporsche 1116
barcode literally needs an awardd for how great he played this
tee makes me soo mad
istg this show has so many ups and downs i wanna cry
tee and white are really sweet cant wait for the next episode
ep5    
 ep6 ep   100  17 
poor non i feel so bad for him all he wanted was to have friends and look what they did to him 
that teacher is sooo disgustaaaanggg ew ew he should be put up in jail
jin i beg you pls leave non alonee stop gaslighting him to stay
im rooting for non to unalived everyone except phee tbh
yeah all of them can go to hell
 ep6        
playing non had to be a very exhausting and mentally draining role barcode has done it justice but i can imagine he wouldve needed some mind space to let go of the role after shooting
this show is driving me crazy why non doesnt switch schools and get away from these awful people is beyond me they are not your friends why put up with the bullying its so painful
 ep5      
the way i screamed through most of this episode i was on the edge of my seat this series is so well made and detailed i have so many questions still about how we get from here to the start of the show but thats the beauty of a mystery 
so can someone explain to me that phee and jin is a thing before and based on episode 7 phee is non boyfriend and jin has a feeling to non im confused helppp meeeee 
phee and non was boyfriend first
when is next episode
5 episodes left then i can binge watch because im seeing and reading good things about this series
the ghost ship that started in kp
the series is getting too chaotic and im starting to annoy  less interested to watch
i feel so bad for copper why barcode must have a lot of screen time this 2 latest ep just made me skip a lot just to watch copper
previous episode na stress talaga ako
that teacher is messed up i feel bad for phee he did not deserve to be betrayed like that
another great episode im really enjoying the story line so far especially barcode who is wonderfully portraying the complex role of non yep next saturday couldnt come any sooner
barcode bat ang lantud mo na hahaha napabayaan kaba ni jeff  huhu paganda na ng paganda ang series na to 
since barcode turned 18 hes kissing everybody lol for real though some many people have taken advantage of non that it makes me sad and livid at the same time they destroyed that child and this is a lesson i taught my kids about predators and socalled friends
plot twist
woww this episode had my anxiety rising every minute with a twist after twist i cant wait till the next episode
i dont like it 
can we have series between this two i mean their own series tabarcode
im hoping that jin and white come out of this alive i want white to really see the person hes so in love with the tree branch wasnt enough for por tee needs something bad i just cant think of it now all of them are assholes fluke is just as bad
for real to think i felt bad for por getting hurt i need worst to happen to tee and fluke ridiculous
if non murdered them all i would consider it justifiable homicide
plot twist 
great story 
never thought i would wanna see jj and barcode together but its actually not that bad
what are you doing non
nooo my tacopper ship  kind of disappointed it turn out this way please let pheejin have an happy ending
so cutehope this cp have their own series
do you mean pheenon
the way i am so down bad for pheenon for that single hug the way they were clutching each other was just everything to me 
us makes a great villain or maybe an antihero hope they book him as one again in the future
i miss him as tay in kp
omg omg omggggg  i cant wait for next week what the heck this plot twist is so gooood
omg ta twist i love it i never expected him to be the  guy also i want everyone else to die lol i cant wait to see what happens 
i really hate tes
the more this continues the less and less i like tee top and fluke the amount mess they put non in its like hes their worst enemy
am so confusedso does it mean that non was secretly dating phee and when he unalive phee will join the group for revenge of his dff
i guess so i probably missed something before but i thought the heart non was texting for some time was jin because of their chemistry but it wasnt maybe phee joined the group to found what they did to non and possibly bring them to justice or revenge like you said
ugh my loves togetherim so happy idc
i like tacopper the most they have this chemistry overflowing from the very beginning
im ready to jump through the screen to fight everybody doing my boy wrong
wait whattttttttt
ang ganda ng first few episodes but getting boring na sana naging quick review nlng history move on na sa current event lol
d q pa sya nasimulan panoorin was planning to binge watch after it ends
feeling sad for jin already he doesnt deserve to be played or be used for revenge if he really has nothing to do with nons case
maybe pha and jin are working together
this series is soooo good 
screech wow boc is giving us the ghost ships and the new ships and love triangles im loving it are we going to see barcodes first kiss are we going to get a tabarcode kiss before a barcodejeff one i cant wait a whole week faceplant
jin is on his way to nons home where he might meet phee for the first time however im really concerned about the possibility of phee using jin  please dont the death of two people even for revenge is too cruel
wow didnt see that outcome
this is insaneeeeee whatttt
omg pheenon unexpected  before this i am expecting that white  non had some relation cant wait for the next episode
this series gives me a headache that means its well done  i shouldnt have started it before the last episode was published  i cant wait 
wait phee and non but the teacher though see i knew it was something up with him
 but none of the others have been able to see masked killer at the exact same timeone always sees when the other cant
 i dont think jin is actually helping phee to get revenge he seems clueless as he was screaming when he saw mrkengjin is a good guy for sure but i think phee doesnt know that and have used him to get into the group hope jin remains as good character till the end
exactly especially when jin is like cant you see him over there or cant u hear anything then phee will act like naaa i didnt hear or see anything naga i have been suspicious of that dude since
whatever is this plot twist tacode finally happened 
i think this series supposed to be tacopper but why now it seems like ta and barcode feel kinda disappointed it doesnt look like copper is the main cast
theres still 6 episodes left so we have to wait and see what happens my theory is ta and copper get together to avenge barcode or maybe they met stopped liking barcode and started to like each other instead but copper is definitely main cast this is backstory for later
felt the same way indeed
this is a flashback before jin  pheasant met hes probably getting revenge for his boyfriend
omg then phee is the culprit i think he is getting help from that sir as well poor jin i think he got used by phee for his revenge
phee and non  i didnt see that coming
omg i just realized that they are singing barcodes song from kinnporsche the series its the song he sang for kim
i think one of the boys was watching kp at the lunch table on a tablet too lol
ohhhh its getting spicy
the biggest plot twist ive seen in a while also love that copperjin watched kinnporsche
