big dragon sound
upon rewatching this im still on the absolute incredulous notion that phee would ever forgive jin but then to date jin after so nons dead and jin just skips off into the sunset with his man i havent been this grateful for a cliffhanger in a long while bravisimo
omggggggg so good
the ending like its not done yet i dont likes the ending 
i dropped this series after episode 2 but im so glad ive made it this far this is a hidden gem
jyybk
wait what are we getting a season 2 how you just gunna end it like that
i dont know what to think or who to blame anymore this is crazily amazing  and why do i have the feeling that white is connected to non cant wait to see the next episode everyone is impressive  good job
i really like it when newtan plans revenge his heartache must be repaid for everything he experienced they must also experience it
all i can say is they are all good ive seen ta us and barcode from kinnporsche and they excel in here they grab the opportunity just perfectly and top character forgot the actors name  i saw him in some cutie cutie role and he delivered his roles so darn good
want to see all of them again in other seriesdramasroles this series is just interesting actors and people at bts everyone are so good a 100000000xxx 
this show has me completely confused
they are reacting just like audience who doesnt know what will happen
they might be young but their acting is so good especially non
wooah tan new is the real master mind why is phee telling everything to jin is he reliable idk i wish them good luck my pheenon heart 
new being that manipulative
i am so invested in this series tannew cracked after his parents passed who wouldnt after what they did phee lost only non tan lost his whole family its hard for me to see phee feel even a little sympathy for jin but i get it phee acts like a playboy but he falls in love
im thinking fluke leaked the video
short episode this time 
what a masterpiece 
this going crazy right now 
no frkn way i knew from the start that white was a part of nons revenge holy crap bro
i think this is the shortest episode wth
when is ep 10 coming out
they are competitive
im excited about the plot twist for white
im so excited for tomorrow cant wait to see whats gonna happen in the present time all the chemistry is on point they are absolutely delivering entertainment in these episodes credits to the writers actors directors editors camera crew stylists etc love them
i think the actors are doing a great job also in my opinion ta and copper are amazing together
i think jin is a really good character he literally went against his friends to defend non every time they bashed or attacked him until non did mr kang even after that when non freaks out and attacks them with a knife jin is the one that stands up and says sorry and is t
and that he is the most to blame i dont get why hes getting so much hate he shouldnt have filmed that but he realized that and tried to correct it people may not like that he still stayed friends with the group but there is a lot we dont know
 i dont want to dislocated your shoulders this phee is a high pitch pervert 
 seriously  very funny i tell you
i laughed at that dialogue i was like who says that its new  but the dialogue was fun though
 you didnt study dumbass i swear this tan new was a whole mood during the class exam
the only reason why my heart breaks for jin is because he fell for two guys but they did not feel the same way but the heart wants what it wants phee is softhearted when he loves he loves with his whole heart he fell for jin you can see it but jin was part of the asshole
group jin and the rest of those assholes are part of where non is right now they destroyed him from the inside out and deserved everything coming to them how far do i want them to go i didnt want them dead but at least jail time with their lives destroy i want them to live
wwwwoooooooowwwwoow
i hope nothing happens to white as he was never involved with anything that happened
phee is the only one who has kept it together in all this
aww man we dont get to see how white and tee met thats what im most curious about because white is way too innocent but its ok its probably not super relevant to the plot this show has been great i really like everyones acting 
crazy theory what if white is related to the teacher who disappeared with non  like they are brothers or relatives
   
also i am ghost shipping bible and max so hard for no reason they had next to no interactions but they would be really good in a show together
 no i think there mixing ta and bible cause they played in the same show together
 same question why talking about bible here when he have nothing to do in this show
bible is in this show 
they were right about bump though as sad as i was to see max go in dff bump really does have something special that draws the attention i think fluke is the one who is secretly the worst of all of them i think he uploaded the video of non and the tutor and he sees everything
i love bibles voice when he speaks english i know its his first language but his voice is so pleasant and perths accent is so nice too
tan new completely lost his mind and seemed to have no control of the situation he has lost everything jin is such a coward but i hope nothing bad happened to him i think phee likes him but what they been doing for the 2 years this episode was a rollercoaster
how many times did you watch that nc scene me yes
this series is stressing me tf out after this episode all i can ask is whats real and whats just a hallucination is por actually dead or are they hallucinating also i do not like phee and jin together ta and copper have zero chemistry i hope they dont stay paired
their chemistry is really good seems like they might be a new bl couple not sure if they will get their own bl soon or initially start with side characters in another bl series like kimche in kinn porsche
why do you think they dont have chemistry just wonder
what you talking about  ta and copper have an real good chemistry together you need to watch them again closely
l think without intending to do so phee fell in love with jineverything will come crashing down when he realize that its jin who filmed non  mr keng plus l think if tan tries to harm jim him and phee will have a fallout
i left at 3 and now im glad i came back for 9daaaaaaaaaaaaam
if phee ends up with jin i will be speechless i dont like jin
hes only using jin to find out what happened to non
listen i dont like jin
wait till the endafter that hate if you wantwho know the real plot twist
everyone thinks newtan is so great he lied and took his parents money for two years without having any contact with them and yes i knowhis parents arent getting any awards for being parents of the year
i was not prepared for the slap 
i dont know how i feel about pheejin i wonder if non was still alive who would phee choose
just imagine non comes back after 3 years of a happy life abroad with mr keng only to find he has no family left no house and even his former lover has been killed or injured by his brother and new is either in jail or has committed suicide
how does that make sense mrkeng got hit by the gangs car and died
i lost my mind in that nc scene wtf  also i know non had it so hard but i pity new so much he had to learn about the disappearance of his brother stop school and witness the death of his parents thats too much for him  i hope nons still alive tho idk what to feel
about phee actually falling for jin i shipped these two when i saw them in ep one but knowing the bs non had to go through i dont think they can have phee end up with jin at the end
i feel sorry to non he got use of this bunch of user especially tee he deserve to die in this series i dont have any sympathy to them except for white ta and tan they deserve what is happened to them isnt enough actually coz look what happened to non family
2936 phee i dont have any clothes jin [you wont need them anyway] 
so far except the clear issues my biggest problem with jin is his naivety i dont if it was on purpose regarding that but trying to convince non that it would get better when the movie group clearly hates him is peak blindness tbh as soon as non wrote the script cont
 thats very true but personally i couldnt stand the person i liked being treated like that the correct decision for jin shouldve been telling non to distance himself from the group with him and non hanging out together by themselves
i dont think it was naivety i think he knew they wouldnt stop but he liked non and wanted to be near him
their tune shouldve changed although it wouldve been fake but its better than nothing i just wish non wouldve taken phees advice to get away from them or switch schools i held hope for jin but knowing his friends i shouldnt have been surprised that my hopes were dashed
also at this point you cant help but sympathize with nu yes he was a little too selfinvolved to be the best sibling but he loved his brother clearly and for the fallout of his disappearance to wipe out his entire family kill everybody
phee in his daddy villain avenger era is giving me all that i didnt know i needed however i do think hes lost the plot as far as jin is concerned and i dont think jin deserves a redemption story arc even if he was just a bystander he complied with all the bs
 they have outdone themselves with this series
well oh my damn this series is freaking incredible im so invested its crazy top it off with the explicit scene that i was not expecting and whoa
ngl my pheenon heart hurt seeing pheejin together but i did rewatch for scientific purposes lmao ta is so dvmn fine bro all i need in my life right now is a phee lol now that we know that tannew is the instigator lets see how far phee is willing to go
i totally agree with you as an adult straight european woman i find tas masculine vibe incredibly appealing i never imagined that id find myself fantasizing about a thai bl actor
im sure phee caught feelings im not a jin fan but it is what it is i hope phee learns the truth about the video though i want tan and phee to make it and i want white safe and learn how much his boyfriend aint shjt tee essentially destroyed a whole family
i feel so bad for newtan
i want to see non again i dont care about phee anymore nobody deserve to get bullied like that non i hope ur not dead 
this series is so good that every episode released makes me crave for more phom chob sees jin being in love also i hope its not just for revenge phi coz im holding on to your promise with jin that he is safe with you
 that night when jin saw non with khru keng he was upset and was crying all night this is the reason why i think jin had feelings for non and saw him with another guy phee and saw him with khru keng i think it was also accidentally when the video he took was posted
im also a bit confusedis it me thinking that jin develo feelings for non that time but back up coz he saw non with someone and that phee i think also he never recognized that that was phee since they left i think he never saw phee face that night
incredible
punish them  punish them all  they deserve it 
this is a thrilling series but i am not thrilled i always sad huhuhuhu every episode is freakin sad can we have at least one happy episode huhgughu
jin saw phew and non together  how come him doesnt recognize him
that was what i thought too but meybe it was too dark and jin didnt recognize phee
he did not see his face
jin doesnt see phee face thats why
i think he only saw them from behind
from behind dst see the face
showing the cheeks is crazyy 
god damn that nc scene but as expected from the makers of kinnporsche
i know right
wow this episode was a roller coaster of emotions
phee is getting seriously distracted i hope he and tan can still get revenge for non in the end
new tan best brother
are we not getting english subs for this episode we got them for the 8th episode
i had to go into subtitles to chose english
another great episode 9 the suspense is killing me  i cant wait to see how the story will unfold particularly tees and whites
me too
yooo this episode is crazzyyy my eyes couldnt keep them open or closed
kuddos to all the actors next ep gonna be interesting asf
also my heart aches for tannew poor man going through so much
i know there will be pheejin saucy scene but still i did nawt expect it to be this explicit it caught me off guard ngl
erghhh im stresing out
omg i love this series its so good
how are there no comments yet did that nc scene leave everyone too stunned
guilty as charged  i was not ready for the nc scene and it was sooo hard not to scream  ngl after the nc scene i had to stop for a moment and was like omggg
yes shocked 
grabeeeeee  
grabe talaga kawawa naman si new
i think phee really did start to fall for jin because they are both kind of similar and he might have reminded him of non thats a reason why new told him just dont fall in love with him
 you are victim blaming you can see what that boy was going through and he was groomed by hes teacher dont forget he was 17 are you telling me you could do better if you were in his position is your moral compass working
the cheek of newtan to question phee on if he cheated on his brother when they all know non cheated with the teacher first was a bit harsh boys heart was broken by your brother and he is still willing to take regenge on his behalf
i agree with you  plus i think he did really like the intimacy cause he went for seconds the next day and he was kind of sweet about it i think that the level of chemistry is out of this world
ayoooo vegass look at your lil broo 
macau grew up 
hed be so proud 3
new and nons parents are villian 2
finally
did anyone else gasp at that phee and jin nc scene  
love this show so far
