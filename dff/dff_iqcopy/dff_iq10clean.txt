this series is really good im just wondering how i missed it earlier but im confused with the ending if they are still at the house what happen behind why they dreaming as though they living good life
i love the series
dannnggg what an ending
and theyre just gonna end it like that now i need to know more
spooky thriller series i kind of knew that even if the entire cast dies two characters will survive in the end maybe from my sixth sense or because i have read similar novels as i exactly guessed jin and phee as survivors   but did not expect the next twist after that
yall cant leave us on a cliffhanger like that
barcode and copper are beautiful
i like white i really do but what is his purpose cause all this whining is just to much 
nong barcode best actor of the year
ive had enough of phee jin is despicable they r a good pair
tee deserves a good life he has been through a lot too
me watching the supposed to be romantic scene of teewhite with full harbored hatred he doesnt deserved any happiness for what he did to non his family condition isnt an excuse he shall b damned in hell of guilt for the rest of his life others too
spare white he is inoccent
why non be dead he need justice why u killed him in this episode hope all of them die they deserved it
puro halucination nalng tlga
wow my heart his hurting for non i can feel this heaviness on my chest throughout this whole episode i want to cry but i am at work and im trying to hold it in that whole gang needs to go to jail bullying at its worst form
omg another week of rotting  i need to watch the last episode now this is soo
wow okay ive been waiting for new to kill everyone
perfectly done
my heart hurts for non all this because he wanted to have friends and fit in great job barcode because you are playing this character so i am good i cried with you
its true dont judge a book by its covereveryone is to be blame for nons casestarting frm the parents through friend to the boyfriend i dont know of new bt damn he was the one affected most comparing to nonany ways let me not concludecheers to the new boc generation

tee n white scenes is just too cute too handle hello boc i need jjfuaiz new series with romcom genre pls
my poor white save him from this shenanigans
kinda feel a bit sympathetic for tee dude literally had no other choices
where is new episode
my favorite scene from dff ep 10 is when fluke confessed that he didnt help non when non was bullied by his friends is because he was afraid that he would be the target of bullying by his friends the amount of guilt he has for non is sincere he also has shown some signs of
worry and care for non deep inside i admit being a bystander of bullying is never a choice fluke is just a kid whos dilligent to study but got into wrong group of friends i wish he would escape the terror and become a doctor to make his mom proud 
i love your reaction  its as if you didnt play a character in that series i cant wait for episode 11

fluke seemed like the pressure that had been suppressed for a long time finally broke out his inaction actually made him feel great pressure inside i really feel that bump acting skills have improved a lot and he handles the details very well he really looks like a psycho
tan showed that he would do anything to avenge his brother he was completely desperate to let the bad guys get punished it is impossible to judge whether he did too much  but his choice of revenge at the beginning proved that he could give up everything for non
ok
completely in awe with bumps acting this episode it seriously gave me chills how well he delivered those lines and with such intensity too i truly felt my own heart stop watching it no wonder even douchebag tee folded cannot wait to hear teewhites story in the next ep
     
        
        
ep   
   
       
          
        
best series of the year
i just finished the hidden character dff and i must applaud the entire cast just watching the series alone made me appreciate their talent but watching thc dff made me love each and every one of them and i want nothing more than to see them succeed and grow dff
anyone absolutely obsessed with this this is so well acted and written and ill say it till the day i die its only been two days since episode ten and im already too excited for episode 11 looking forward to another incredible part cant wait
im here for non and non always
wowwww i was in awe this entire episode i didnt expect all these twists this is so so well done and man i think bump is the best actor in this he has been believable from start to finish in this character i really see great things in his future 
i hate how everyone is going against phee already bro wait till the series is done to judge all the characters you guys did the same thing with jin saying its sad he may die because he didnt do anything wrong and now everyone hates him cause he hurt non too
my favorite scene is tan  tops scene because i love how their acting so natural the way mio change his facial expression  the details of his character and i always appreciate all the cast because they played very well to show how guilty they are for treating non badly
           
its crazy how the whole cast except for ta and barcode looks like someone who is already acting in the bl industry
pheenon all the way
    
sadly every character the friends in this series is twisted and wicked  yes even non and im anticipating the revelation of whites involvement in this whole mess will show hes not a good person either what a tragedy 
i understand tan where he come from but he went too little far coz he include uncle for this and for me phee he did well for telling the truth coz that is the right thing he need to do and the rest they deserve it coz the are all accountable for everything happened to non

whew the mess this has evolved into the deeper you go the worse it becomes still low key rooting for tan though well except for killing uncle dan but wow this series really showed how terrible the domino effect can be
 no he said no one would die from the drug lol
 im not sure about jin too lol but if i was phee i wouldve tried to expose tan earlier when dang died because tan is too far gone not that i blame him with everything that happened but tan obviously lied when he confirmed no one would die
i hate that he killed uncle dang too im good with tan taking out everyone else who used and abused non i want white phee and jin still not sure yet to live
this show is really good i love all the twists and turns that happen every week i was rooting for nons brother until he was the one that killed poor uncle dang he was innocent the rest of them are evil but i still think nons brother has gone to far
hold your horse maybe uncle dang too was involve in this mess too early to say anything now
wasnt he the one who drove non top  tee to the uncles even tho he didnt know what was going on why didnt he question that someone was unconscious on his property hes the adult in the situation so he has some responsibility
this episode is very fillery the highlight is definitely fluke and jet being unhinged and tan just staring at fluke while hes hallucinating is so delicious i really have hots for that psycho genius
i dont know what acting workshops does boc have but dammmmm from watching them in the hidden character to this series these guys are killing it
pity on nan
pity on nanpheenan to be not phijin
i dont want to watch it anymorepity on nan he betrayed by phi
thank you fluke fluke channeled me in this episode lol make tee talk fluke is non still alive thats my biggest hope atp i alao hope new gets away with everything cant wait to see whites involvement in all this if any
       
i feel sorry for new
[paused at 415] jin you bastard you yelling at phee for not stopping tan why didnt you stop your s h i t t y friends from bullying non you liked non he was your friend then how could you let it happen you stayed silent and even encouraged him to put up with
 exactly i am loving how non and phee was i want pheenon not pheejin
     
i only feel bad for white he got dragged into everything
same
their are theories going around that white is involved with the plan
pheejin is perfect cp hope they will gone too 
          3 
aingggg benci bet sama yang namanyaaa jin phee top semuanyaaa bejir  kek gak ada salah apapun anjirrlahhhh
i want non to be alive so badly
 yesss i think hes best actor in this series wow
also bump is doing a fantastic job as fluke
ang pogi ni mio
and jin what a horrible human being for phee to equate himself to jin for being justifiably angry and saying something cruel vs jin who was jealous and did something cruel i just kept saying phee you can not be serious  at this point i need non to pop up 
yall im mad well revisit the myriad of reasons why later but in this episode the main reason why is phee m phee on one hand i adore phee but on the other i am livid about his underwhelming reaction to jins confession i was like what
 girrlll im like how in what world are you jealous of statutory rape like even if it appeared to be consensual why would you not talk to non or report the teacher but instead you record and post it on the internet aint no coming back from that no redemption whatsoever
saaaame he looked shocked and disappointed cursed a bit but then it was business as usual
i like it when fluke held white hostage and told tee to reveal the truth when tee reveals the truth nons family got fucked up because they thought non ran away with mr keng tan face was hurt when hearing those words was from jin his family was destroyed and now hes alone
tannew such an evil genius
in short psycho
 wow
only trust tan and phee disappoint us again 
i dont trust psychotic drug addict tan i only trust phee
      
this is so exciting the plot the twist and everything hands down and praises to the writer the actors who made the script come to life and everyone in the production i hope this series wont come to an end i keep on wanting more from this 
omg  can it be next saturday already 
ahhhh this series is so fn good seriously the twists and turns and acting are so damn good i really hope this series and these actors  many of them new  get accolades for this
im curious about what happened to non i feel sorry for her battered face cant wait for episode 11
 0136  switch personality  persona    11
waaaaah the acting
im lost here
maybe i can explain something what do you want to know
me tooi am so confused
  
ugh so lost
 uncovered ver  
i knew itt whiteeeeee
    
i feel annoyed because i think here everyone is bad and i cant trust everyone except nong white maybe but their acting is all amazing 
i hate phee now
new suga you taking too long to unalive these mofos tee needs especially to get it
this ep very emotional everyone started to be honest in this ep and to be honest i was a lil bit surprised by tans character he is very manipulative he can even manipulate phee and the fastest he change his expression really scared me but this is what we called good acting
 especially beat non for no reason he gave them the money he was free then they just decided he must be a spy pisses me off
gosh everything is starting take since but in the end yall all failed non and for the while that knew non didnt drip tye camera should of spoke up a long time ago this pisses me off they beat non and his teacher ass for no reason smh
now i hate phee more then anyone ok i will tell you about my hate list 1 phee jin top tee 2 the rest i wish them a painful death  i do not hate tan poor
no no dont hate phee just yet and trust im pissed too but i think hes just a little confused momentarily it has been 3 years but in the next episode if his wits arent gathered by then or if he stays with jin then yes team phee is canceled
phee youre traitor
looking at next trailer tee helped non and something about white being involved too or maybe white saw tee with non and misunderstood and kill non brain not braining no more
cant wait to watch the next ep
