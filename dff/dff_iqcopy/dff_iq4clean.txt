i am only on episode 4 and this is already too hard to watch i dont know if i can continue
jj has changed i see more confidence and comfortable selfexpression i love to see it
lovely acting all im glad i saw the first hidden character theyve improved barcodes acting  the range id prefer less on the bed scene with ta and copper theyre playing minors here so  the toy rocking was 
i wanna punch fluke
 2        
 aggressive    aggressive    
 ep4     
  
       
tbh i love every episode but ep 4 is my favorite episode because this ep hit different  this episode has very interesting and challenging plot  starting from the scene of the kids going to the temple to find top then showing one of the mask killers to the tense 
 moreover in this episode we can see and get to know more deeply about every charachters personality in this current situation like flukes personality fluke seem like having calm character but from this ep we can know that hes not that calm  hes very emotional character
 and for phee surprisingly he has calm character even tho he has to faced a tense situationthis ep is very appropriate to be used as a transition between present  flashbacks bcs at least we already know a lil bit about the personality of each character in this series
omyghadddddd i love the plotttt
fluke is studying to be a doctor why didnt he expose the wound to fully exam it and he trying to sew it with the top on
the series is full of inconsistencies like why are his hands stained after washing the blood off in the real world blood doesnt stain skin
like bruh im a mess over here my baby barcode 
i need something happy to watch now to ease my mind im still reeling ugh
jjay and fuaiz are so cute together  i cant wait to see how their characters story unfold in dff
unfolded like a beautiful dumpster fire its so sad but thats karma
i thought non was still alive but if phee is doing things with jin it means non really is dead from the preview of next weeks it looks like phee would never do anything to hurt non as in cheating
screaming jin likes non phee is with non and the teacher  i wonder which of the friend groups is also in on it barcode with the rizz now if jeff shows up 
omg im shcoked about non and phi like wtf so they was boyfriend before and jin has crush on non its esay to see but in the end after non dead phi and jin are in relationship thats kind funny btw i cant support tee por and top attitude can i push them 
please do lol
not gunna like the bullying is pissing me off  which i guess is a compliment to the actors because they are doing a good job at portraying a bunch of jerks
tee and top are on my hit list for what they did fluke too because he sat there and watched them set non up from start to finish whole group was either too lazy  arrogant to come up with any ideas of their own  treated him like trash robbed me of my jinnon ship too 
fluke bro they legit said it wasnt your fault and top killed por but now youre holding them at gun point make it make sense
fluke reminds me of the kid who was obsessed with grades in duty after school
ok i have a new theory this whole thing was orchestrated by jin for non jin was about to go abraod and they wanted to spend a weekend of partying to say goodbye he convinces por to use his house gather the crew and the killing began as his finally im sorry bro to non
tee por and the other one deserve the karma 
scratch that even jin
 except jin
they all do
i was feeling sorry for what was happening to them until this episode they deserve it 
i know white was low key dumb for looking at the video not that i dont understand why he did it with all the secrets these people are keeping to themselves but i feel so bad for him hes clearly such a soft boy and innocent of all of this
non copper is the most suspicious dont be fooled
fluke when i catch you
now i want them to die asap  except jin
even jin
i hate bullies its so hard to watch non being bullied this is hard to watch but i want non to have his revenge jin please keep protecting non
 yes
is non barode
barcode is so freaking handsome dude 
now im wondering what else did they do to non because when top killed por he made it seem like he knew they did terrible shjt and they deserve to die he made it seem like he didnt have any involvement but this all kicked off when top broke pors camera and tee covered it up
i instantly dislike the whole friend group except jin
im only rooting for 2 or 3 to make it out alive one of them is white because he didnt have anything to do with it
omg i hate when everybody hate one person when he did nothing wrong and we see that non got some medicine and i think he got depression something like that i really hate when naon got accused about the camera when he was top who broken thats make want to push them in their
faces and i think jin and naon got a relationship naon had a big feeling for jin is easy to see anyway i really hate tee top and por they are so horrible i just want to give a big hug naon
fluke is evil i havent put any kind of trust into him since the first episode he always gives me a serial killer psycho vibes
where is ep 5
this was such a good episode i cant wait to see if non really is the killer or not
fluke is getting on my mfkn nerves
i need fluke to goneeee for good
tee come and get yo man my poor baby
wow the mvp of this episode is bump his acting is so good here i really like ta and coppers acting too i wasnt a huge fan of them in thc but they are doing a really great job 
i didnt watch thc before this so i was really surprised that bump had no acting experience
im so obsessed with this series  every week is harder to have to wait for a new episode
each episode is better and better last episode fluke scared me this time top scared the heii out of me lol im loving this series and the reaction videos are so good the guys are funny im ready for episode 5 lol
i know the dude had an axe and is creepy looking but there were 4 of them they could have easily over powered him in that scene instead they ran away ugh
i give up too much gore not into that
well yea you can tell just by the title that its a horrorsuspense series
fluke needs to go
tee is just as bad
agree
           dffep4
fluke selfishhhh
am literally obsessed with this series  just the best 
this series is a far cry from the quality of kinnporsche the plot has so much potential but screenplay and execution are quite disappointing i hope it gets better in the next episodes
you would think that with three of the actors from kinnporsche in this it would be that good i still like it though
 
i am ready for barcode
all in favor of fluke being the next to go say i
the behind the scene clips at the end  is hilarious 
i really enjoyed this ep even if some parts in the house seems to be a lil dragged nice to see some tacopper scenes and i am so hyped for the next ep  barcode
fluke is scary
