I’m on episode 6 and I don’t know if I can continue. The level of bullying in this has me so upset. Non just wanted to belong and have friends. Por, Tee, and want to be famous, have me sick to my stomach! I don’t know if I’m going to finish this series. Thank you Jin for caring!

yeah, I was bullied pretty hard as a kid and some of this stuff is really triggering, some of the scenes I had to take my headphones off and just read the subtitles because that helped get me handle it. I'm still interested in the show though.

EP5 จริงๆทุกคนอาจจะลืมไปแล้วว่าจริงๆจินเคยช่วยนนท์จากการที่พยามฆ่าตัวตายที่ไม่มีเงินซ่อมกล้องมาแล้วครั้งนึง จินพยายามคุยกับนนท์ให้ใจเย็นๆรับผิดชอบเท่าที่ไหวแล้วยังชวนนนท์มาเป็นผู้ช่วยเพื่อหาเงินมาคืนปอให้ทำอะไรได้ก็ทำไปก่อน เด็กม.ปลาย ถ้าไม่รักเพื่อนมันไม่มาหามาห่วงแบบนี้หรอก

ชอบ ep6 เพราะepที่ผ่านๆมานนเป็นคนดีเป็นฝ่ายถูกกระทำมาตลอด พอครั้งนั้นนลุกขึ้นมาหลอกเพื่อนเปิดบัญชีม้า ทำให้รู้สึกว่าที่จริงเรื่องนี้ไม่มีใครที่เป็นสีขาว 100% ซึ่งเป็นเรื่องจริงของมนุษย์ทุกคน และชอบการที่เขียนให้นนที่อายุแค่17 เลือกแก้ไขปัญหาด้วยการเพิ่มปัญหาแบบนี้สนุกซับซ้อนไปอีก

ชอบ EP6 มากๆ เราได้เห็นการแสดงของบาร์โค้ดที่ดันบาร์ตัวเองไปสูงมาก เล่นได้เป็นตัวละครที่แตกสลายจริงๆ และก็เฉลยตัวละคร และปมของเรื่องราวหลายๆเรื่องของแก๊งค์เพื่อนแก๊งค์นี้ ดูแล้วสงสารนนท์มาก เป็นตัวละครที่ถูกกระทำ และไม่มีอำนาจจะไปสู้ใครได้เลย

Playing Non had to be a very exhausting and mentally draining role. Barcode has done it justice, but I can imagine he would've needed some mind space to let go of the role after shooting.

ชอบ EP5 ที่สุด เพราะเป็นจุดที่เริ่มคลี่คลายปมต่างๆที่ทำให้เกิดเรื่องราวที่ผ่านมา สะท้อนมุมมองและประเด็นของที่ซีรีย์ที่ต้องการจะสื่อนอกจากความสัมพันธ์ที่ซับซ้อนของตัวละคร คือการตีแผ่ประเด็นปัญหาสังคมที่เริ่มจากจุดเล็กๆในโรงเรียน ครอบครัว จนลุกลามไปถึงการก่อความรุนแรงและอาชญากรรม

Since Barcode turned 18, he's kissing everybody, lol. For real, though some many people have taken advantage of Non that it makes me sad and livid at the same time. They destroyed that child, and this is a lesson I taught my kids about predators and so-called friends.

I guess so. I probably missed something before but I thought the heart Non was texting for some time was Jin because of their chemistry but it wasn’t. Maybe Phee joined the group to found what they did to Non and possibly bring them to justice or revenge like you said.

Jin is on his way to Non's home, where he might meet Phee for the first time. However, I'm really concerned about the possibility of Phee using Jin. 😩 Please don’t! (The death of two people, even for revenge, is too cruel.)

Replying to User702a43399: I don’t think Jin is actually helping Phee to get revenge. He seems clueless as he was screaming when he saw Mr.Keng.Jin is a good guy for sure but I think Phee doesn’t know that and have used him to get into the group. Hope Jin remains as good character till the end

There’s still 6 episodes left so we have to wait and see what happens… my theory is Ta and Copper get together to avenge Barcode… or maybe they met stopped liking Barcode and started to like each other instead but Copper is definitely main cast this is backstory for later
