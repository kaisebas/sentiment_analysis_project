more tragic than i thought it would be was ready for a slasher with some revenge was not ready to be haunted by nons story and keep thinking of it days later
frankly the ending was fitting they all deserved to die with the exception of white and non non was a victim of atrocious behavior the rest trying to escape responsibility tan is the example of the depths humanity can get to when pushed to the extremes of human viscousness
im so disappointed with the ending wtf
white didnt deserve this 
im gonna need the actors of tee and white to have their own series already  i loved their couple so much
every character except white was so unlikable i wanted them all to die by the end 
gosh i love these writers when jin and phee were at the water in the end and everything seemed too perfect i was like aw cmon this is lame and the writers were like yes it is syke
tee shouldve died instead of white
im so shocked this is actually pretty good ive never seen a horror bl before this needs more credit hope season 2 can come out so ill know what happens
i believe this has to have a season 2  please make phee and jin a couple for real
i had to rewatch because i was confused about the ending i didnt hear someone light something and blow out something the first time now i need to know if tan really died
second time watching the whole season again enjoyed it even more i kinda love cliffhangers on seriesjust hoping there will be more i really want season 2
i finished watching this a while ago but this series was amazing and i cried a lot but i will say i enjoyed it very much
this is damn goodengaging all emotions right from the begining1010 all characters played their so well well done
simply superb it was fantastic and will watch it again 1010 thank you be on cloud for another awesome series to all actors thank you
loved the kinnporsche tiein at the end these kind of behind the scenes are inspiring and satisfying to me it makes me want to go work there and i get interested in the art part more deeply thank you again everyone may you all be healthy and happy
this show is a real gem awesome script really good actors which gave it all for their roles and what a cool and classic horror ending i was so surprised by this show
thats it no more episodes wtf
 my thoughts exactly
boc memang on top tak pernah mengecewakan 
bro noooo white is innocent he didnt deserve to die
rewatched the ep and i think im more emotional this time around who else sobbed at certain scenes  boc i need a happy series after this is it okay to hope 4mins will be even a bit happier 
reflecting on ta and copper its nice to see them grow and the pairing work out id love to see them play adults in a different storyline i feel like they grew as people during the htc and filming process which can be seen in the interviews so far im still watching
i feel like with all the conflicts this series could have been longer it would be interesting to see a season 2 maybe with the other thc people who didnt make this one and barcode because he stole this show i was happy to see perth and hope to see him in other projects
cant wait the season 2
also hello boc pls make a new romcom series for jjfuaiz pleaaaseee
this series has some flaws but i think its a good series kuddos to all actors and staff
what is this this is the special ep
grateful to make it to the end thank you to everyone that made this series happen gym attendance is definitely noticed on the actors barcode  2j was gorgeous yet played a despicable character  i loved the nonlinnear storytelling idea
unsure if this is cultural and given the genre i may have used a wrong word butteachers have a lot of power over students a minor saying yes isnt the same as an adult saying yes i understood as it was presented but couldnt forgive the character
soooooo good cant wait for seaaon 2 please be a season 2
yall cant appreciate that this genre is horrormystery most of the genre have open endings like this this was amazing acting great story that gripped you from beginning to end and kept you on your toes barcode acting is amazing
really terrible what a terrible ending even though i have been a fan of this directors work for over 15 years and his work used to be very interesting of course most of his work is a bad ending and he always talks about somewhat loliness and i see it in this story
 including an ending that is openended but doesnt feel like we have to keep thinking about it damn this is the final arc that brings this shit down into the abyss and then transformed itself into a bgrade american horror movie
this series also has a team of famous thai screenwriters joining in writing the script but i feel that this final episode is extremely mainstream easy to read not fun and too difficult for the actors abilities
what series is this rating 910
this reminded me of a drama with this cliffhanger too cant remember the name
i think familiar like jemputan ke neraka drama malaysiaabout youngsister balas demdam for her sister about bully at school
the story familiar jemputan ke neraka young sister balas dendam to her sister cause her sister get bully at school
is this the ending
wow are they still hallucinating
i dont have an issue with the ending except for the lack of conclusion with what happened to non and the teacher
they both already dead
non died the teachers organs got sold
  
did it have to end on a cliff hanger like this will there be a season 2 to complete the mystery i still dont understand who killed or how non died or every one at that
i  jin n phee but y did white have to die
white
one of the only people that i want to survive died in the hands of his lover rip white he really didnt deserve it
real bro didnt even want to be at the function 
im going to have to give the mvamost valuable actor to barcode because the talent really jumped out in this series the emotions facial expressions ad chemistry are just superb he went above and beyond the call of duty to give a perfect portrayal of non
exactly iam soo proud of him
when jin had his hallucinations was that tee doing him in the shower
i believe it was the tutor
logic would dictate that its new who else knows about the antidote other than new and phee also as i said before jin is the absolute worst the fact that phee is so accepting of what he did irks me and it doesnt seem true to his character jins redemption arc is trash
i feel like tee is the absolute worst he began the trap that non could not get out of in the first place set him up to make it seem like he broke pors camera when it was never him he wouldnt have gotten involved with owing any type of money or even needed that tutor teacher
 im reading the comments and im not understanding what some of you dont understand about the ending phee and jin dont make it out phee realizes that theyre still drugged the better question is who is alive still to light the cigarette 
that is a very good question
justice for white
 agreed
ikr it makes me soo sad white was sooo sweet and didnt deserve any of it
say it again for the people in the back
i love it perfect ending
im sorry i tried to watch it and i just skipped many episodes its too confusing i did not like it i didnt even understand the end
what its an open ending so thier is s2 i fell mix emotion on this series good job guys you play will the character hoping to see ta on more series
this is a master piece everyone did an amazing job its one of the best shows i have seen so far thank you for all the work i am sure we all hope we see a special episode or a second session 
so they just hang us like that 55555
barcode acting was spectacularbut the end is more like unfinished wtf that i just watch
white and phee didnt deserve to die
wtf worst ending ever
the ending left me so triggered just my theory like alice in the borderland  what if phee jin and tee are traumatised with the fact and couldnt get out of their own imaginations while the ones who are dead are make it out alive in need of special episodes to satisfy
was thinking how could jin get let off so lightly  until the end perfect love the idea that they are stuck still loved the show characters and plot barcode is simply stunning  hope we may get a special but lets see 
lets admit it we watch bl for the tension chemistry and kisses between two handsome guys the cast was great featuring a passionate masculine top and two cute attractive bottoms so why the focus on fake blood social problems and evil
because we actually like shows with good story line other than that stufftheres alot of bls out there that only focuses on those things that you can watch if you dont like it theres no need to comment just leave
im satisfied with the ending that none of them survived
im gonna say the cult got tee jinta and phee cuz wtf was that ending bro
this was so bizarre ending  weird started well that lost in translation and confusing
omg whats that though barcode acting was really superb and amazing buthello do we expect season 2 with this kind of ending
the series is better in everything except the ending thats the problem with horrorsuspense storyline sometimes you just dont know how to end it so youll leave it hanging openended jin doesnt deserve to get out there alive or not non and tees acting are 
they did not
missing people dead bodies and no one is found no investigation i feel like none of it really happened but how was it actually a company making a movie  we just watched their movie or was it all a psychotic dream from one of the boys mind blowing to try and understand it
its open ending so its depend on what u want to believe for me it might be phees dream all along from ep1 til the end  so no one are ever existed from the start
  
i just hoped that there are more eps or longer eps for scenes
this is not your typical cliche bl series i appreciate a different presentation of bl with an in depth discussion that not only runs on romance but also personality mh family friends norms and environment i am glad that they were able to tackle a lot 22
maybe we will have additional eps maybe i want answers as to where non is i felt jin fluke top and white wasnt given depth in their back stories that is why character development is lacking i just felt that some parts were lacking but this is a great series 12
why white have to die he was innocent worst ending
im sorry i dont like the endingit there another episode
what the hell i was mad the whole episode well except top getting killed that was nice to see
the ending was a big cliffhanger i need a new season or something
i got so tensed up in this episode but the ending confuses me like what do you mean theyphee jin and tee didnt left the house
bruh there better be a sec 2 cuz i cant accept this ending
i hope theres special episode
a chaotic ending to an intriguing story but the guys did a good job especially bump and barcode i look forward to their next moves
 had me right up until the ending  that shxt was not thought out properly 
this series was epic even the ending left me speechless you have to be a hardcore mysteryhorror fan to get this series ever episode was meticulously thought out and leaves you wanted more your emotions is all over the place but in a good way 
ye
all the actors played their roles very well their acting skills were very good the visualization of this series is also very good and detailed i hope there will be a 2nd szn bcs the end of this szn is open ending and there are still many questions on my mind
im disappointed
 thats all i got
wtf
the ending confused me a lot but according to my theory phee jin and tee never left that house i wish tan and white hadnt died thats the part i was most upset about it was so sad
dff ep 12 was chaotic and horrific even though im sort of glad its over im glad i watched it it really kept my attention
whaaaat
this has to be the stupidest series i have ever watched i wouldn even give it one star what a waste of time the story is so confusing you cant even follow it
same here ive wasted my money and time only for this series ive taken membership im disappointed
same here that was the biggest waste of my time and energy barcode deserves better cant wait to see him with jeff satur
one of the best bl i have seen
white should have made it out of there he was completely innocent he had nothing to do with any of it
true
okay and again the question where is non playboy the actors were good thats all the good that can be said okay direction and music story no comment
what the hell i hate the ending so frustrating
this is really bad like iggy azalea bad
iggy isnt bad tho so theres that
 huh 
i bet i can watch this series 10 times and still be confused
what just happened here 
idk 
worst finale in history
i need a special episode stat
this has become one of my all time favorite bl dramas i need more tacopper dramas
wow just wow i didnt like it at first cuz i didnt get where it was going but im so glad i stuck with it that scene where phee and new were fighting was soooo good im so proud of them they did such a good job and i cant wait for season 2
i laughed so hard when top and fluke died on the stairs  i hope tee is forever tormented so are ogee and jin alive or dead all in all i really enjoyed this series
 i think the teacher was killed before non they had mo use for him i also think phee is still hallucinating
what happened to the teacherwas the teacher the policeman who got hit by the cari am so confused 
stupidest drama ive ever watched barcode deserves better than this shit show cant wait to see his drama with jeff satur at least hell be the main lead
the ending caught me off guard 
why white at least it looks like there might be a 2nd season soooooo gooood
what happened are phee and jin dead too
who knows
well done boys very good acting bravi the plot the directing and all  almost touch the good scandinavian noir movies i wish most of the thai bl moviesseries were as good kudos to all involved
what kind of ending is that did they die or not 
so non really did want revenge even on phee who he cheated on  poor innocent white
 exactly
bro the ending made me so mad like wtf
are you kidding me this is the ending horrible show
white is innocent 
what
also i still say bump was the vip of the series i fully believed his character from start to finish he never held anything back
woof that ending wow at first i was upset but that ending just made everything better congrats to the whole team this series is so good the actors definitely did their best and the storyline was great
ok that made no sense this entire show
honestly wtf
wtf
wth happened i am confused
i swear if barcode doesnt win any awards for his acting in this i will sue they all did an amazing jib but code went all out you can see his hard work and dedication in this series
it can not end like this we have to get more i cant accept the possibility of the three biggest traitors and liars possibly making it out alive
i had to finish it but i dont like it i am guessing they are all dead and they still say what happened to non as to how he died or tee is the only one that survived either way i didnt like this one
wth
newbis drgging them to death
here we go again 
poor white i feel bad for him
