hurt people hurt peoplethat seems to be a running theme in this show 
non deserve better 
 
all of the guys are being jerks but top is the only one who seems to be getting genuine joy from watching non be tormented
i just wanted to come on here and say that everybody in this series is a hot ass mess
man baby baracode is killing it in this show im so proud of him
yeah so im gonna gaslight myself into thinking that white is still alive and he get to live a happy ever after with tee
white
i love tan and white together in the end 
ep   
i hate the bully mentality but more so the person who sees it and does nothing they all deserve what they get in the end 1 down 4 to go
oh baracode acting so good at such an young age he has an amazing potential  worth it so good 
if pheenon are not gonna end up together im gonna cry
 
wth  i caught chills 2259 
ep 7               
english subtitles
this plottwist was so insane i dont really think anyone saw this one coming pheenon is so sweet its so heartbreaking to know they are gonna end up together in the end we can see from this that all non ever wanted was love he wasnt loved by his parents not by his friend
i clocked the set up since the beginning but questioned myself cant wait to see what happens
not by his teachers everyone failed him except phee but still in the end he was driveb by rage and said thisr aweful things to him i cant wait to see how this story is going to develop phee has to avenge my precious non
this episode is clearing up almost all the relationshipsits a little shock but i really want to appreciate the acting of all actors which really bring us into this seriesand theres more clues for us to investigate and its funreally cant wait for the day all clues are solve
barcode is a really great actor also the character non is a very sexual character hes acting out of lust because he thinks he can get true love in return from his partner and side pieces
side pieces he let his teacher take advantage of him for money to pay off some sht he didnt even break
i wonder if jeff has seen this episode 
i was thinking the same thing
7     
hmm im ready for the next bully to die teeyour up my man
7      
im so heartbroken poor phee and jin i love pheenon and now im just crying my eyes out 
 mr keng in the worst wdym
por tee top and non is the worst
there are many twists and turns in this episode many things happened in just one short episode it made me feel like i was on a roller coaster while watching it although havent been many stories about flukenbump aired yet but i will always support him playing a baddie555
pheenon is so cuteee and how i was shock about kru keng and non it made dff so interesting and i am so excited for the coming episodes to come to know what happened that resulted the first 4 episodes to happen
will jin end up dead because of phees wrath
those scumbags should be tortured before they die thats the right justice for what they did to non 
such a damn good dark story
plot twist is supposed to be a situation where by we the viewers just the wildest shock cuz of the unexpected character so in my opinion white deserves to be nons brother making him the biggest plot twist of the movie cuz he is the most scariest and innocent among them all
i cant wait to watch the next episode
we need music video or lyric video 
we need officiallyric music video for these ost 
 ep 7         
im terrified to watch this episode lolllhere we gooooo
english subs for the special clips please
now we know now we know
  
preview of ep 9 is really making a lot of sense now maybe phee and tan are there to take revenge on behalf of non maybe theyre there to find information i could be wrong but thats what i think it is so far everything is slowly coming into place now
i have watched this many times since i became a bl fan in 2020 but i still keep coming back  i even read the novel because the series is too short i know its very impossible but im still hoping for season 2
please i couldnt even watch the scene with non and the teacher its so gross ahhhhh
english subtitles please i cry
hias phee and non look so good together tho hiiias
wait why is phee acting like he doesnt know who non is when theyre all at the house in the woods in the very first episode he obviously did since they were dating im going to wait till all episodes are out to finish because this series has me hella confused
probably because hes involved with the killings
maybe he approached the group to avenge non coz he knew what kind of assholes those people are
hes pretending that he doesnt bc i think hes trying to get revenge for how they treated non
why would non decide to write a script for people who call him greasy why would be tee would ever want to help him nons common sense is out of the window the only person i feel bad about is phee he had tears in his eyes and had a gut feeling that non was lying
this is another series that should have a higher ratingive seen some rated this series with 1  and it deserves so much more this is a keep you on the edge of your seat thriller and the actors are doing a great jobbut im biased to talove him 
i wonder if he gets with jin later for revenge
i feel bad for non dont get me wrong but the only person out of all of this so far that i want to surviveget justice is phee he has shown no flaws yeah maybe he was a lil bit of an asshole in the beginning but omg his poor heart i just wanna hug him
well ive just binged watched 7 episodes and this series seems too have me hooked so much happening anyone could be doing the murders  poor non and phee i do hope non is not dead and the others all get what they deserve brilliant storyline and well done to all the actors
lets just hope its not another disappointing end like another series that just ended not getting my hopes up this time would rather wait to be pleasantly surprised than letdown
first off the teacher is disgusting and a pedo tee por and top and white deserve the worst fluke and tin are just as bad bc they see whats happening to non and they do the bare minimum and non did not deserve none of this to happen to him  and phee baby you stronger than me
i hate top the most he makes me wanna crunch my fist into his face but it seems that they are all a bunch of bottom feeders guess this is a great example of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer
white is innocent lol
wait what did white do
there screaming so damm loud 
my babies are all grown up  jsjsjsnsnsnsbsbsbshshsjsjsjsjsjs
that teacher how disgusting to sleep with a student eww and those group of so called friends are truly awful people im glad there slowing getting whats coming to them they deserve every single thing they get jerks 
doesnt non have an older brother named new when is he coming into the picture and phee had every right to be upset his friend zoning jin for the longest now makes a lot more sense cant wait to see what happens next
english subs please 
all the characters are hideous  and yes that includes non my gut feel tells me a terrible part of phees character will also be revealed soon is there even a real protagonist in this series this will definitely have a tragic ending
 they mean hideous as they have hideous personalities not hideous features that also applies with the word ugly theyre ugly on the inside
do you mean you think they are all bad guys or do you think theyre ugly cause what you said doesnt make sense
what do you mean hideous do you mean like they are all bad people or do you think they are ugly cause thats what hideous means
all of them that did him wrong deserve to die
dying isnt justice its beating the rap imprisonment lock them up with real thugs i believe it would honor non best
im thinking it was top and tee who probably uploaded the sex tape and not jinremember top was following non
 agreed 
great twist so jin thinks he did even though he didnt get to clock post before his pc went black and feels bad for involving non into the project this places jin in danger unbeknownst to him non is a cheat tho however his trauma is clear
when i tell yall i loveeeee barcode he snapped as he should have i dont know if yall caught we he told tee the only friends he has is dead non been messed up its something about those quite freaky people
i feel bad for non
plot twist tan is non older brother he has infiltrated the group to take revenge on them theyre all high from non s medication
holy snap this started somewhat awkward and uncertain to captivate my attention i stopped watching but  the boys are doing well and the hell written into this series is fascinating poor non all the crap hes had to manage will keep watching for sure kudos 2 all
so frm what im getting in the teaser for the next ep is barcode is the killeri need a new ep nowwwww
i feel its phee however theres so much going on anyone jin too or a partnership between phee  jin
tbh i hope they get the teacher fired bc thats just made weird and i think barcode acting a little slow not noticing that this is a not as big as a problem it is so like yk but still keeping me interested even thoooooooo
getting better each week
the plot twist burn me out
omg this was a crazy episode i cant believe it and the next episode he will totally loose it for sure  the acting with ta is so good cant wait for the next episode for sure
that tongue is something else
where
now we know who it is and why maybe
i feel so bad for phee so disappointed in jin and so grossed our by the teacher
its getting better and better
phee father so great 
group therapy anyone 
 me too
sign me up
trust me we had the same reaction to phee  non 
damnnnnn 
oh now it time for fun
if i were non yeah they deserve it
oh and phee he should of listened to his boyfriend who loved him for real he didnt and caused pain for everyone around him will phee forgive him should he
he should of listened to his gut and not involve himself with any of them
omg  cant wait for next episode ohhh barcode i love you mannnnnnnn
the plot twist that keeps on giving idk whats gonna happen next anymore 
that escalated quickly this is really good 
barcode is such a good actor
this show is actually really good all the plot twists
right they all grew so quickly
what have you done is the theme of episode 7
oh my gosh it was really shocking i was surprised to know phee and non was couple after everything now i dont know what to feel about non i am heart brokeni am looking forward for the next episode 
oooooooooommmmmmmggggggg this is far from what i imagined barcode aaaaaahhhhhhh but whatever you and tah came all the way to be these great actors well done  great job dff casts
words cannot express how phenomenal this episode was i justim floored im scared for non this whole episode scared hed get hurt scared hed get caught scared hed hurt himself its all bad i feel ao bad for phee at the first pf the episode i changed my mind about jin
friend why would you do that you hadnt confessed to him or anything so why did you put him him out like that jin is a shjtty friend too wow this episode has my emotions on edge
like he enables hia friends he sees theyre shjtty people and yet he still goes along with them and talks non into taking their bs too then the sex tape happened and im like yeahhhhhhh jin in his feelings and exposing him like that like hes his man hes suppose to be your
if this doesnt end in non killing all these btards then i will not be happy  the only one who gets a pass right now is phee i like the acting in this but surprisingly i think 2j is the weak link i dont really believe him as the sleazy teacher
 i feel like white is innocent and i have no idea about tan yet
 i believe one them is non brotherjust cant figure out which one
what about white and tan im wondering what role they play in this series are they innocent or are they part of revenge
for some reason i feel like i saw this before like deja vu i have no idea why though 
on of the best for long  cant wait for each episode 
i realize now that fluke isnt really that bad just the king of minding my own business lol
i have no words
nooooo they made 2j a pervertwith barcode no wonder us is pissed off all kidding aside i dont know what non was thinking he had a way out phee and he screwed it up todays episode was nons fault and i am scared but curious to see what the next episode brings
given how time was flirting with mccaua while he was dancing with tay in kp i think 2j has already been made a pervert agree about the way out and screwing it up
phees dad lawwwd 
yessssss
that man is scrumptious
also i feel really bad for non but homeboy is full of bad decisions the one person you had in your corner you betray in the worst way if you would have just walked away from those aholes and that script the moment they treated you like trash you wouldnt be here
omg
i need it to be next episode likenow i envy those who can binge watch thishey future me this is a reminder to not do this to yourself again
seriously jin instead of helping your friend you get in your feelings that non has no clue about and do that to him the fact that you even recorded it instead of calling the po po is cray cray
or tell the principal i guess
jj is playing a fkn predator say it aint so 
just wow
i feel so bad for phee
oh no non
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i just came here to squeal like a stuck pig
also i want all of the bully crew to get whats coming to them i want white to know the real tee por fluke etc it makes me sad and livid with how they treated non thats why you cant treat people any kind of way now youre going to pay for it
i want white to know the real tee this part white is a sweetheart from what weve seen and he is with that ahole like how much has he really changed remember when him and top almost left everyone until he looked on his phone and remembered he had a man to protect
why did yall erase my comments i feel so bad for non everyone was taking advantage of him in every way possible the teacher and his socalled friends did him wrong i was definitely on the side of jin until he did what he did i dont know what he was thinking
pheenon had so much chemistry that my eyes was sparkling like a why did the teacher have to manipulate non  jin i thought he was good but he let the jealousy blind him im sad because i really like pheenon  jinnon
ta and barcode was a ship i didnt know i needed til now
i never understood why ppl thought jinn was a good friend i always thought something was a little off plus i always noticed non seemed uncomfortable when jinn would touch him
well well well barcode is not the innocent kid anymore na 
let me just live in the first five minutes of the episode 
oh my barcodes acting is insane
holy  i already thought this series was good but omgsh its even waaaaay better than what i thought this is going in all sorts of directions  i love it excellent acting on all parts ps  phees dad and the teacher although ick are hot
oh wow poor non  
oh wow poor non  
omg
what a delightful episode estoy  pero mudisimo con todo lo que esta pasando
im with phee on this one
im soim shocked this whole episode was soooo crazy
well thats a lot to digest
i knew that teacher was suspect i feel bad for phee
i couldnt have prepared myself for the content in this episode i just hope protection was used on non
dffep7 was something else  cant believe we got to see tabarcode kiss before jeffbarcode  not complaining tho our adorable ghost ship sailed too hard 
damnn nons a player bro rlly belongs to the streets lmao jin accidentally uploaded the s3xtapebasically means that hes not innocent as well lol hope it doesnt get worse for himphee went thru so much hope fluke dont turn bad too for the rest of the bois hope yall die
non about to snap and i feel so bad for him 
barcode is such an amazing actor his scenes gives me the chills every time
2j x barcode the unexpected
