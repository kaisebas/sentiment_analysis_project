this was genuinely the most heartbreaking episode so far seeing non constantly manipulated and bullied was so hard to watch not to mention fluke being complicit in the bullying ughh makes my skin itch lets just hope theres a silver lining in the form of jin 
love how everyone in the comments is saying that they feel so bad for non which i do too like this poor man just wanted friends and ended up getting taken advantage of so much then theres also me an actual writer saying yeah thats thats the writing process
also genuinely think that only the ones who hurt non should be killed like leave white alone leave phee and jin and tan alone it should only be the original guys who die like tee top fluke all them should die not the others
does anyone else think the guy that plays tee looks a bit like mew im really enjoying this so far i love non and white jin seems ok at the moment and so does phee
okay wait this actually just got interesting
teachers pet
i also do the head hitting thing when im stressed
there is no bts scene
 5555
seeing this episode i can somehow say they deserve to suffer
wow barcode played the role beautifully heart went out for non and white non was put through hell and white was innocent everyone hurt non directly or indirectly no one left that house
 26       
oh my gosh
 ep5            
like i literally dont like anyone atp
they were so awful to non omg
serem banget cukyyyy aku nonton pake layar kecil aja udah merinding bombay
what a bunch of ahs non is helping them with their project and they treat him like crap they dont even call him by his name i hope whoever is after them makes them pay
theyve done an excellent job of creating a whole bunch of pretty despicable characters for this story yikes im sure there are a bunch of plot twists to come but its startling how many bad decisions can be made by a small group of people
i cant watch this poor non
man i dunno anymore just when i think i have a solid theory something else happens and im back go square one lmao
why non the only one got hurt poor non
this should be called everyones mean to barcode
this is so fxck up
non why phi was such a good boyfriend had all high hopes for jin but posting that was a hugh invasion thats left there for everyone to see and what was he mad for they not dating phi reaction warranted but he made it sound like it happened before
top tee if only i was that masked killer i
damnpor is an asshole but tee and top should have been the first ones i would have taken out fluke didnt participate but i still dont like him jin is showing more concern and crush on non phi and non as lovers my ghostship ta and barcode 
tabarcode
barcode you did a very good job from kinporsche to dffyoull grow up to be a very fine young man keep it up gonna wait and see your next project
dawgg tee is the worst 02
jj likes bc copper likes bc ta likes bc bc is the luckiesunluckiest guys here
bow i get it one is domestic violence one is peer pressure one is illegal tansaction nice back story
tee uncle is doing money laundering huh
u see top n tee is the worst kind of human ever
 what a twist wasnt vibing that teacher at all and i feel sorry for jin he was the only one that was actually being nice and helping non cant wait for next episode 
so por is the only child and he died
cant wait for tacode 
hmmm phee and non i am kinda feel sad and disappointed because i love pheejin lets see what will happen i wonder if phee still use jin in the present or actually care about him
wow tee and top did non dirty  interesting back story
this episode was surprising  great job guys
didnt see that coming at all
tabarcode 
this episode really made me cry i was bullied in school and it breaks my heart when kids do this
cant wait next eps 
tacode next week is going to be another mess for sure
that preview for next week 
i also hate pors whole family
tee is trash
hes the whole landfill
omg i was shipping tabarcode since kinnporsche era and now it finally happened so happy
im totally confused as to how they knew each other ahead of time so did he only get close to jin to get revenge for non or did he really like both of them mind blown
love this shows so much 
i think this series supposed to be tacopper but why it seems like ta and barcode feel kinda disappointed
2j is literally so fine
after seeing these basars im hoping and glad they de horrible det7s
its that jj with his fine self playing the teacher  yummy
i cant believe that boc would put money into this thing their last two productions were high quality this is not the best vehicle for a phenom like barcode what were they thinking
the sad part is this is literally how it is in real life when making friends kids are so mean lol i have to keep reminding myself its just a show its just a show 
i cant only watch a little bit at a time 
i had to do the same i wanted to go through me tv screen and slap the shit out of those 3 bastards when they call him greasy it makes me so angry
yeah i had to take a breather after this episode it was a tad triggering
the sad part is this is literally how it is in real life when making friends kids are so mean lol i have to keep reminding myself its just a show its just a show 
it really took three people to restrain barcode hahaha
i feel bad for non he just wants to make friends and now not only did he tire himself for a script that he didnt even get recognition for he has to pay for a camera that he did not destroy and do it in illegal means because what else can he do
the way im rooting for the masked killer to be non and slowly but surely torture the group mentally before killing them especially top and tee
im going to need white to run away like a track star and its not even from non haunting them its from his shtty boyfriend tee youre better off alone now i feel even more bad for white
see i completely understand why non is haunting them they dont even have to fully explain the backstory anymore i would haunt them too the only decent person is jin the reason to hate non hes introverted wants friends the lack of at least impartial treatment astounds me
well they deserve something that episode was upsetting i hope jin is actually nice and is helping non maybe even one of the new characters and the teacher they had to show the teacher for a reason i swear if he is someone else who hurt non giving him a ride i will be pissed
wowwww why are all the characters in this so shitty its hard to watch but man barcodes acting here is top notch i also see a little copperbarcode chemistry haha this script is really interesting there are so many mysteries 
barcode and coppers chemistry is something i expected because they look good together but i did not expect how much i would be down for this ship hahahaha
i think they have chemistry too copper acts well with barcode and he seems more relaxed i watched a bts episode and i remember being struck by how barcode stared at copper while he was singing and kept looking at him during the episode they must really get along
i noticed the copperbarcode chemistry too i was like wait a minute why is there a little spark here lol but this situation is a little hard to watch for me too theyreexcept jin treating non with the upmost disrespect
por just gives me a really ray vibe
man that is so much worse then what i could have even imagined poor non white is about the only reason i have a shred of hope tee doesnt die now
tee set non up just so he can use him to open a bank acc for his shady uncleln my books he is the worst of evil
i love jin but for some reason he seems so suspicious to me
i only like jin and non the rest are terrible aint no way i wouldve taken that from them i wouldve been fighting
this episode was hard to watch it actually should have a trigger warning for those who struggle with bllying watch with discretion 
truthfully i had to take a few breaks from watching this because they doing way too much to non
haaa thats why u all should die all is fake except jin always got bullies poor non and i miss ta
i have a theory that the person non is texting with the heart emoji is someone in the group and they are helping him get revenge i think maybe tan because we didnt see tan and top get separated after the motorcycle accident so i think tan did something to top just a theory
 tbh i had low hopes for tans survival because imagine smoking with asthma
i also think tan is going to suffocate because theyve mentioned his asthma a couple times chekovs asthma
these bullies are a bunch of losers  they all deserve to die including jin who cant firmly stand up against his idiot friends
really missed tas protective and masculine vibes in the last episode hes the highlight of the show for me
this episode was hard and i felt so bad for non and worst one was top tee and por even if tee is suffering it doesnt excuse his actions i hope jins kindness is just kindness and he doesnt have an ulterior motive behind his actions all in all it remains exciting
im more inclined to believe that jins kindness is fake and that he has an ulterior motive he somehow tolerated his friends crappy treatment of non by not holding his ground and not being firm in condemning their actions
someone save non please 
im ready to jump in the screen and beat everybody ass except jin non did them a favor and they wanna treat him like that im infuriated
omg barcode you are amazing you are incredibly talented i have goosebumps
worst episode so far hope they all die and suffer from craziness
i love how in the beginning of this show we were all rooting for them to survive and now we all are rooting for their downfall
after this episode i hate them all por tee top and fluke can all rot in hell jin was the only decent one so far i want to know what really happened to non hes gotta be dead right if so i hope his ghost gets his revenge and kills them all
who needs enemies when you have a friend group like that geez
finally barcode entered the chat
omg barcode you are amazing you are incredibly talented i have goosebumps
his family life isnt that great the only one who didnt treat him badly was the one who was communicating honestly with him at this point the only ones i dont want dead are white fruiaz mio ta and cooper i dont want no more hurt to come non
i commented twice and didnt know where they went however this is the thai male version of mean girls por and the other treated non like he was a piece of trash taking credit for work they had no hand they were bullying him you can see he has no friends low esteem
i feel that non and jin have feelings for each other
its looking like a possibility that jin is crushing on non but it seems like non isnt quite sure what to think hes little stand offish second guessing jins intentions hard to say but i hope thay realize they like each other and dont let others interfere be brave jin non
am i tweaking or was the answer to that maths question 1 thats been distracting me maybe its a metaphor for 1 person left
i wanna fight this whole friend group for making nons life miserable may por rot in hell
theyre bunch of bulliesthey deserve to be deadkll all them non take you revenge
episode 5 was so traumatizing 
ate as always
i am looking forward to the wrath of non
dang i hope that non gets them
