I am so confused about how he survived so long with something through his stomach. Aint no way that didn't hit something vital right?

It's because they didn't remove it from its stomach so it's keeping him from bleeding out and dying immediately. Also the stick is kinda holding everything together for now so that's why he needs help within two days

ชอบอีพีนี้มาก ตอนดูคือใจเต้นแรง อีพีนี้ออกแนวสืบสวนเอาตัวรอด เป็นอีพีของการดำเนินเรื่อง ชอบตอนที่ทุกตัวละครมาอยู่รวมกัน ทุกตัวคาแรคเตอร์ชัดเจนมาก ทั้งลุ้น ทั้งกลัว ทั้งเอาใจช่วย รู้สึกเหมือนตัวเองอยู่ในเรื่องราวในนั้นด้วย รวมๆอีพีนี้อึดอัดมาก แต่ก็ชอบมากด้วยเหมือนกัน ทำถึงสุดๆ

Be On Cloud did not disappoint. This series, the actors and staff are AMAZING. I am really going nuts about Fluke. Talk about nervous to psycho in one episode. 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪

these people do not seem concerned enough about their dying friend and the dead uncle 😭 if they REALLY wanted to help Por, they'd seriously try to run away

The only thing I don't like is that, they didn't even think that as long as Por is not getting into the hospital the more he's dying. But I am instilling in my mind that those boys are kids and maybe really scared of the " ghost ".

I'm even even more mad that uncle Dan came on his scooter and not his truck. I'm waiting to see how this plays out cause I'm suspicious of EVERYONE, even the new friends.

I really like this series. It is very refreshing to see that they would make a horror/ BL. The acting is good.
