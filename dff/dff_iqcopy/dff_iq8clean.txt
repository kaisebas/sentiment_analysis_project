they keep mentioning new but they never show him im hoping theyre twins and its a glass onion situation
i cant tell if non is a good or bad person but how dare he cheat on poor phee
im mad that he didnt just tell phee about the debt but i honestly cant blame him for sleeping with that guy for the money to save his own life
i need a season to
this whole series was bananas unlike any other bl you will see i like that they went a very different route for this bl
im speechlessso there have ss2 oooh noooo but i love it finally my pheejin saviour but non and tan feel sad but is look like tan still alive actually i really dont want anyone to die teewhite
every plot twists is driving me crazy
i hate you phee
my heart hurts so bad for non  i can feel the pain  barcode is such a good actor the pain hes tried to potray really get me  not just barcode but all of the actors are such a good and excellent actors  the way they express their emotions are so good 
nons parents are the worst parents in all bls mother is worst than the father but both bad 
 i was not expecting that that was an intense seen for such young actors im impressed with how well they pulled it off
listen phee in his daddy villan avenger era is everything i didnt know i needed however i do think that hes lost the plot as far as jin is concerned and im positive that i dont want to see a redemptive story arc for jin whether an active antagonist or bystander
they ruined his whole family they all deserve it and sorry but even jin
the plot is so awesome love it
ep8 is sooo hot 
it hurts to see jin broke again 
anjeng semua  dahla mati semua gapapaaaa 
who voice at the end  mr keng
the gasp that i gusp
im speechless what a plot my heart broke
taaaaaaaaaa
top tier
holy shit this episode was crazy i knew it was tan and phees plan to befriend the group but i didnt expect them to drg them all making it seem like theyre crazy and hallucinating holy shit that is insane next episode is gonna be even crazier i just know it
english subtitles please
okknowing what i know nowim going to watch the beginning episodes over cause phee punching tee is personal now
fluke doesnt realize that by him doing nothing hes just as guilty as all the rest of them this series is so good and it deserves all the praise its so much more than just a bl
i dont understand why anyone would rate this below 4this series definitely doesnt deserve low ratings marks its a thriller with melodramaone of the best ive seen on herenot to mention great actors and omg ta and cooper barcode and jj are awesome as well
 they definitely are and i believe i just posted mines now tell me when i specifically told someone what they should likeyou must be one of few who rated the show below 4if so like you say your opinion 
we are all entitled to our own opinions just because you like something doesnt mean everyone will
found it hard to get into this series and then found out barcode was in it binge watched 6episodes and this show is crazy good and bad for those struggling with first episodes hang in there it gets better now the long wait begins for the last 4 episodes

every time phee dad comes on screen i am like heeeeyyyyy daddy  its my reprieve from all the crazy in this show
not me playing the last part in slow motion to have a peak who called phee after the movie 
same i paused itwhich speaks volumes about my pausing skills i think it was tan
 bl  teen slasherhorror           
ok barcode is slaying this character acting is top tier i absolutely love phee and i cant wait to see which direction he goes with this group like all poor non needed was one decent friend

we need behind the scenes too 
i have to give tens where tens are due barcodes acting as non is amazing the way he acted out the degradation of nons mental health is superb
excited for next episode
yes phee in his villain era lets go
           iqiyixdff
whenever fluke claims he has nothing to do with this i cant help but laugh i have many gripes with this group so much i could write an essay but fluke bothers my soul because all it would taken is an one on one conversation with por that it wasnt non who dropped the camera
literally i hate complicit bullies
that that scene and every one with him in it irked my soul like just speak up fluke is the biggest coward in the group 
maybe its his parents and newbut using emojis just seemed like he was trying to keep their identities secret 
i just throwing it out therecould they have secretly been seeing each othercause non never verbally agreed to be in a monogamous relationship with phee and non seems to blindly trust teewhy would he drink from his canteen
i think thats his call logs
does non have 3emoji for contacts i wonder who they are im just throwing it out there but could he had multiple sexual partnersexppheemrkeng and  omg teesometimes tee feelings came across as he cared for non
i think its just his call history so its likely the same contact
i think it can be just his call history so its likely the same contact
im in piecesim drowning in tears 
no i dont think non and tee had a sexual relationship i think he only looked like he cared so he could get non to do what he wants and when non did do what he wanted he treated him like crap again so i doubt they had anything going on
devil works hard but vietnamesse translators work harder
why is there no english subtitles 
no english sub why vietnam
and the revenge plot begins i really love this series its so twisted but are the teacher and non alive we need to know haha i cant wait for next week 
the first couple of episodes was boring and a little confusing at first it got more exciting after episode 6 waiting for episode 9
i just love how everyone has been defending jin so hard and now everyone is like kill them all  its so funny to me

im only 7 mins in but unless its all a new script being played out it came to mind that maybe its new who will take revenge for non just a 
or his parents
jin is a joke he never left the group to support non
tarn mybe king brother
there is no english subs
phee i can still remember you promise jin will protect him ill be holding on to your promise and hopefully this is not just for a revenge
english subtitles please for the dff special clips
how come the special clips of dff do not have english subtitles 
i dont understand its tacopper that won the hidden character but theyre most likely not the highlight in this series i am so confused
its the story line dear
its starting now im half certain tan is non brotherstill dont know what roll white playsmaybe he is truly the only innocent one
the uncle has on the tutorteacher watch
every episode is meticulous about what this director wanted to show to the audience each episode made me so emotional in a good way this episode brought out the vengeful btch in me phee and new please destroy them alleven jin i miss non he needs cuddles
this is my opion i like it so far i love barcodes character non i think non shouldnt have cheated on phee and i think that the teacher shouldnt have slept with his student i dont like him also i think that jin should only showed phee the video non desevre have his revange
non had to be a mentally and emotionally and exhausting role to play it was exhausting watching him be used and abused every episode kydos to barvode for playing such a difficult role i bet there were times he just needed to step away from non to preserve his mental health
after watching the firsts episodes i thought they where good kids but now omg they deserve it all of them they are horrible  so exited for the next episodes

yasss phee is getting revenge for non im here for it so now i know for sure that mrkeng is dead its most likely that non is dead too i hope he is not but we have to wait im so ready for the next episode phee  tan have to be smart with their next move
so tee knew why non disappeared the entire time  phee getting revenge for non and is tan maybe new nons brother  ughhh they gave me guessing 
right i guesss tan is newnon bros
im very excited to see white come into play hopefully we get to see him in the next ep
nobody is answering his calls
tan has to be new nons brother i think that new was the person we caught a glimpse of at the end i think he  phee teamed up to get revenge for non  2 killers this series is so damn good
ls keng an undercover cop or reporter
be careful who you call friends they made non disappear and went abound daily life like nothing happened
about
everybody pissed me off in this episode
4    barcode   
nons villain arc had me alil scared
we know keng is dead but non is most likely dead too i feel so bad for him but phee has to be the one getting revenge and im here for it
omg his acting is great him going all crazy and wanting to hurt them as much hurt as hes feeling i wonder what happened after and i also wonder whats next is non still alive 
poor white hes going to be disappointed with tee and looks like phee and new is killing them for non
looks like pher and tan are together and watching at first non used to have a brother new maybe tan it new non brother
bish these group of friends better all end up dead my anger issues cannot  poor non
oh nooo pee is holding grudge for non most likely he is not serious with jin
phee ta  tan mio better get the revenge for non 
        
i am so here for phee getting reve6 who is tan exactly
we think hes the brother
probably new nons brother
