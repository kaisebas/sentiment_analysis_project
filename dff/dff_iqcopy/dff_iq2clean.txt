this is when id personally pack my things and leave as fast as i could 
i am so confused about how he survived so long with something through his stomach aint no way that didnt hit something vital right
its because they didnt remove it from its stomach so its keeping him from bleeding out and dying immediately also the stick is kinda holding everything together for now so thats why he needs help within two days
movie series 
bruh i dont think i can commit to the watching all the episodes
            
copper is liza soberanoa male version
really i dont understand this series
barcodes acting 
a modern and fresh series with a lot of twist very beautiful
i wanna fight all of them because how dare yall treat baby barcode that way 
the uncle get his head lobbed off but tee and top drive off no problem 
ta is sooooo hot 
im ready for nong barcodes goat acting
  
this shi is actually rlly scared me lmao kuddos to the production teams and the actors they did a good job
same
oh my god 
be on cloud did not disappoint this series the actors and staff are amazing i am really going nuts about fluke talk about nervous to psycho in one episode 
why am i suddenly most scared of the doctor 
subtitles are not available in english
they are thats how i watch it
these people do not seem concerned enough about their dying friend and the dead uncle  if they really wanted to help por theyd seriously try to run away
the only thing i dont like is that they didnt even think that as long as por is not getting into the hospital the more hes dying but i am instilling in my mind that those boys are kids and maybe really scared of the  ghost 
ghost or hallucinations or men taking revenge cant wait to see what happens next
so are all those encounters just hallucinations
im mad it too tan to look at his phone and see white to remember he has a person to take care of lol butthole im even more mad that nobodys tried to ride for help for porlike come on uncle dan made it all the way toting take out plates but yall cant
im even even more mad that uncle dan came on his scooter and not his truck im waiting to see how this plays out cause im suspicious of everyone even the new friends
love this so far
white deserve a big applause in this episode really felt bad for him
i really like this series it is very refreshing to see that they would make a horror bl the acting is good
