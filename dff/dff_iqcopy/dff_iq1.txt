I am crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is hands down the funniest shit I have ever watched. I started wheezing like a smoker with a 2 pack a day habit when they had to twerk. Seeing the blindfold on the plastic pony had tears running down my face. they all have a career in comedy.

This show actually makes sense and is kind of fun and charming if you pretend it's a tabletop RPG and all the characters are being controlled individually by funny nerds trying to make the game interesting

🤔Technically, Phee is innocent, too. Yeah, we're all collectively pissed about him and Non, but truth be told, Phee had a justifiable reason to be upset. Him falling for Jin is poor judgment but not a crime.

If Phee could have kept that same energy that he had 24:37, because Jin was talking that nonsense, and Phee had that "Boy, please 😒" smirk on his face. He could have gotten the truth out of Jin and we could have been up outta there by episode 2.

one of the basics of first aid that anyone should know is to apply pressure to a wound especially one so significant. make it more realistic unless all those boys are dullard and the woods are meant to be dark make it dark it'll make it even creepier

sure, but when there is a situation like this one, NEVER pull it out because when you do, the blood that was being stopped by the object will all be lost and the victim is at more of a risk. for a wound like a bullet you would apply pressure, yes.

Kedisha Graham · 2023-12-27
You apply pressure to a wound to stop it from bleeding. In the case of a stab where the object is still in tact basic first aid is to leave the object in, check if the person is still concious and wait for professional help. Which they essentially did

Honestly you can look up each title and see the cast/Crew and most of their biography have the age they are (currently) and what year they were born. Just don’t ruin it for the rest of us who

The age of consent is 15 in real life. Just look it up and I am also from a Western country as well and also I think it says NC-17 so I understand your concern but this is also not real so DONT think too much into it 🙄

there are a lot of Thai actors who started acting in BL series that were younger than him. His parents gave consent, that's what matters. Also, Fuaiz is not new in the showbiz industry so he knows and his parents know what they're signing up to.

If he is still 17 while filming, he got permission from his parents, so they must have trust and confidence in him and others that he will be treated well and with respect.
