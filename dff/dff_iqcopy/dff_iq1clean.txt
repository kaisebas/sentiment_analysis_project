perfect for this spooky time of year
i want to rewatch this series but the mistresmt and absolutely no justice for non hurts and pisses me off well there is some justicebut still
i am crying  this is hands down the funniest shit i have ever watched i started wheezing like a smoker with a 2 pack a day habit when they had to twerk seeing the blindfold on the plastic pony had tears running down my face they all have a career in comedy
this show actually makes sense and is kind of fun and charming if you pretend its a tabletop rpg and all the characters are being controlled individually by funny nerds trying to make the game interesting
im just waiting for the dm to remind all of them that they left their friend alone on a couch with a stomach wound that is bleeding out
where can i watch the next prince
is not out yet
this is so sad  why did they have to get white involved he didnt do anything to deserve that he is the only innocent in the story 
technically phee is innocent too yeah were all collectively pissed about him and non but truth be told phee had a justifiable reason to be upset him falling for jin is poor judgment but not a crime
i loved it but i need a second season it cant end like that
yes need that second season
i hope jin and phee to have a good ending jin dont suffer anymore
but why its only for vip why we have to pay money omg
barcode is still the best
has got to be a definite top three
so u mean 2 tell me  they r still in that damn house
if phee could have kept that same energy that he had 2437 because jin was talking that nonsense and phee had that boy please  smirk on his face he could have gotten the truth out of jin and we could have been up outta there by episode 2
disappointed that they didnt mention barcode at all
they didnt talk about barcode what is going on they mentioned 2j and ta is from kp and how they improve like barcode is not from kp also barcode is one of the best in dff  
dff was so good it brought out so many emotions from me everyone did an amazing job thank you for this masterpiece of a series
por is still miraculously alive
  
we need a second season where its revealed non faked his death and white survived ambiguous ending here 
why did they not mention barcode at all its sad bcs hes literally in almost every scene did the editor cut it out
thats what i said its pretty weird its like they are trying to take attention away from barcodenon
barcode acting so insanely amazing
i really enjoyed this series all the actors were incredible wish there could be a part 2 where all the dead haunt the house and and forest 
mini blue
this episode is so intense but what the f was that then ending is so confusing
didnt really like the ending here too bad they didnt make more episodes to wrap it up its not complete like i said the ending doesnt make any sense and its uncompleted
love it
im sorry but are we going to get an explanation did non really die bro i was hoping he faked his death and got out of there im sorry but 12 episodes arent enough wheres the rest at
o like kp
all plays were amazing but barcode stole the whole show he was amazing this serie is the perfect combination of drama horror mystery and romance i cant wait to watch the bocs new projects
copper phuriwat 
this drama is a not story probably the fact the that everyone learn lesson thank you for uploading and thank you for director and producer and writer from pakistan
this one as good is non really dead waiting for last ep
first i want to say perth i see you now on to the show im glad tee did all he could for non its the least he could do im sick to my stomach thinking that non had a miserable life then a miserable death were is the fvcking justice bro
omg where is ep 11 im dying no pun intended
avengar
thank you mile and pond for nurturing this group thank you to everyone who made this show happen its ok to cry its ok for people to be attracted to whomever their attracted to im enjoying watching the progression and competition of the show lovely idea 
    mvp
love you guys
the scene i liked the most in dff ep10 was when tannew was still very calm when pheejin told him that he was nons brother and came to find out or get revenge because they not only made the younger brother disappear but his family fell apart
so not cool no english subtitles
i really like the part where tee started telling about what happened to non after nong whites life is being threatened it really shows how he did not want white to be implicated into this situation just because he is tees boyfriend
the amount of sadness i feel for non and it all started over a camera this series is too good
innocent jin  he doesnt anything while he likes it rough 
i dont realy get all the hate reactions couse i love the acting and the complot so much   
not him laying there with a branch in his stomach just on the couch and not at the hospital 
dude there is a murderer trying to kill them they cant go anywere
i love them
the logic isnt logicing i wish they would get better writers i hate when a great plot is ruined by lazy writing dont touch the body what if you leave dna oh but we touched the bike all g we will vouch for you 
no offense but who the hell cares if somebody tried to murder them or not their friend is dying istg and they decided to sit in the living room to find proof for what
well that sends it how dude know the guys just went to sleep upstairs aint one dead in a bathroom
bad acting messy story irrational reations of each characters who the hell wrote the script 
epe2
watching the first episode again makes it more enjoyable because of so many revelations that unfold from the recent episode 9 things from the prior episodes are making more sense now
k im starting to think they killed barcodes charcter
the funny thing is even when theyre sad and panicking about por they still took off their shoes when entering the house xd
asians do out of regular practice its like your body does automatically no need to think to do or not
i cant find the reactions pls anyone knows where to watch them reacting to the eps
its the special clips after each episode
i dont believe with phee anymore now im just feel bad for tan  i hope at the end only tannew and non
im so addicted tt
my pheejin 
only trust tan and the ending should be non and new reunion  living happily together
nons family is so complicated a whole mess
   
im shockedd 
newtan lost his entire family cause those 5 boys they gotta go thats it im done
when ep 9
where is episode 9 
this movie is very enjoyable and interesting
my favorite episode is episode 7 from the beginning of the episode i felt a lot of things in it until the episode was over
thats true
the most complete episode because we feel love happiness destruction despair confusion anger hurt put together by actors who are very good at playing scene after scene so that i as a viewer can feel all these things in one beautiful episode in episode 7
god i couldnt stop crying for non and i really start balling when his dad slapped him barcode you did an amazing job hats off young man everyone is doing a top tier job its been awhile a bl made me cry or feel emotions like this and so far this year theres only 2
i want to know who killed the teacher i want white mios character and phee to live however i need white to see who his boyfriend tee really is fluke and the bully crew can all get what they deserve
i want white tan and phee to still be alive the others can all suffer
i think the thug uncle did something to the tutor im hoping he has the tutor and non working off their debt somewhere and non can escape i hope they werent unalived
this is crazy i bet tan is nons brother new im ready for everyone to dje including the thug azz uncle i only want to see white phee and tan walk away from thisand the killers if its not them shrugs i said what i said and i want non to still be alive
  something or someone bumped it my accident had jin not recorded it and set up the upload thia still wouldnt have been an issue
 ooo he was there he mightve but fluke is the see nothing know nothing type why would he get involved now we saw jin about to upload it but we didnt see him press the button if its not jin then its flukepr some freak accident like jin left the mouse over the button and
 i think fluke uploaded the video fluke sees everything but says nothing and why would he be so afraid if he didnt do something more serious than just be apart of the friend group and know some secrets
 ooo i like this theory too i honestly think jin recorded and uploaded the video just to expose him he liked non then he saw him with phee then he saw him with the tutor and was like nope not gonna cheat and still be happy and i cant even have it
i want white and phee to live also however im thinking non may try to kill phee and jin because of the leaked video and phee and jin having a relationship we still dont know the direct reason why jin recorded and uploaded the video nothing good was coming out of that
what happened why it isnt available here anymore 
pheenon
hoyyyy gagi ang galing ni ta
i never thought that non would be able to hurt my handsome phee
i can never recover from this episode traumatised for life
pheejin
well my pheenon just crashed  and jin bawling his eyes out while posting the video is he jealous and angry sigh this is so complicated i cant stand seeing non this sad anymore
is wah this i ready for the next episode
i cant still think of the plot its such a nice story
phe and non look cute and everything but phe  jin are just on another levelthe tension between them is just fire that being said l think phe should end up with jin
i feel phee should remain single although jin isnt as bad as some of the others he still filmed non and allowed it to be made public i mean if he hadnt recorded non in the first place there wouldnt of been a video to leak
did not expect that  the love triangle and the betrayal cant wait for next episode seems to me that someone is out for revenge
start
niceeeeeee
ooomggggg
my scary ass needs to watch this in the day time
the masked man might be phee he wants revenge for non  if i were the one who got bullied like that i did the same to them
non and phee nobody expected that what how when where dude i need an explanation now
ngl i thought tee was innocent since he was just quiet the first half but nvm hes just as bad lol
i dont care if this ship is doomed from the start i will still go down with it 
this is a romance right
where are the sub
why is tee so mean to non
l love the chemistry of ta and copper
not even a minute in ep 1 and i see an axe blood and dudes running while screaming what the
por 
at first i had suspicions about phe and tan but after episode 4 i became doubtful but in this episode phes suspicions return could he be new 
got to admit im loving how copper and barcode act together they seem so comfortable with one another
my sweet non kill them all they deserve a painful death
omg 
this series is a little bit out of the context until now i understand nothing bored
you could be a little patient and wait for more context there are still 6 episodes left
this series make me scream out but at the same times they friendship and love really cute 
amazing loved the story and the characters the actors were on point
fluke is so cold idk what to think omg
i need to know what they did to non before i get myself any more attached to these characters ffs jin i have faith in you pretty boy dont let me down
fluke was doing way to much cant wait for him to die with his blindself xoxo gossip girl 3
hmm  not scary at all im not watching
your choice its nice though i wanna find the truth
 ep  
fluke hopefully you are next 
i cant stop watching this bl  its got me addicted to it
it seems to me that tee has sacrificed himself phi is my hero i hope that he and jin will survive and be together thanks to boc for a very intriguing series 
good
love the username
l only know ta so lam still trying to remember who is who but the boy playing tan is asking way too many questions about what happened to nondont know if its curiosity or something else
   
barcode 
really fun cant wait for the next episode
 sunday
what day ddf updated 
the production is good the story is very interesting to follow cant miss watching an episode
okay watching them reacting to ep3 makes me suspect fluke more 
i have a bad feeling with nong copper
naay chemistry si tan ug si jin 
best episode yet im amazed at the acting i was so into this episode fluke scared the shjt outta me he was perfect the main person i want to survive this is white i also love that the 2 lovers are stuck in a box lol they have plenty of time to talk their bs out lmao
 i spell it like that to not get deleted 2 of my comments have been flagged and taken down
 but you could read it couldnt you
you spelling is wrong
what is there in watching a friends old school film that right away would make a group of people have such kind or reaction i can understand after viewing it but right before director got ahead of himself
how can i watch this without vip
you cant here
you must hack it
     
 
naqaab film
the fact that they have por laying on the couch overnight with a mother friggin tree in his gut and still alive is wild
theres something fishy about the drink they had
the kids forgot about the phonelandline
it doesnt work they point it out in ep 1
hi
why does it seem like all the partners are men or gays
it literally has an lgbt tag
its called bl boys love series
because its a show about gay people
because its a bl series
this is turning out to be a good horrorbl series im also proud of the boys coming from hidden character to this series theyve come a long way and their acting has improved a lot
wow this is great so far everyone has really improved from the reality show i love jj and fuaiz so much  ta and copper are doing well too im super proud of this cast
paling seneng sama karakter white disini pemberani dia
wow so if i cant take ways side why are the director making charlie and babe selfish aholes and way the one babe runs to when charlie breaks his heart than be pushed on the side ways not selfish in the beginning but when you keep being kicked eventually you attack back
you do know this is not pit babe right
wrong series

i really loved barcodes performance 
wow keeps on getting better of all 2023 dramaaction bls this is the most exciting story is complex tense amazing cast i think this must have a good budget to have such a dedicated team in front of and behind the camera and to have 13 ep 50 min ea

thai drama eng sub movie dead friend forever the series dff
i think this is the first bl series that ive watched for the side couples sky and venus are just boring and childish vee is so immature and downright bipolar with the way he acts sky is borderline psycho stalker
 wrong
im not on series somehow i was watching venus and sky but for some reason the comment came on this series i know who belongs to which series
this is dead friends forever not venus in the sky
venus in the sky gets a lot better after vee stops being stubborn and bjtchy be prepared for the nc scenes they get realistic af id watch again for that alone lmao
 yeah when writing a comment if you dont pause the show it will move to the next show and when you hit send it will post under the new shows comment section its done me like too
huh 
wrong series 
there are no characters named vee and sky in this series i think you are on the wrong series
i dont like it
this is amazing such a great job im so proud of my babies ta and code love them so bad
their reactions to the nc scenes lmaooo
copper is such a pretty boy
so far this series made me laugh than made me scared lol im intrigued with the situationship going on with phee and jin
i like it
this was sooo good so far
its too scary for me 
i found some scenes very akward and its not even the boys acting i think they are doing fine but the pauses and the way these scenes were organized no fluidity at all i really hope the next episodes are better because i had high expectations for this series
for me its good though
this plot is so good and all the cast is amazing i am rewatching bcz i love this genre so much cant wait for next episode 
wrong turn  bl version 
nice
one of the basics of first aid that anyone should know is to apply pressure to a wound especially one so significant make it more realistic unless all those boys are dullard and the woods are meant to be dark make it dark itll make it even creepier
sure but when there is a situation like this one never pull it out because when you do the blood that was being stopped by the object will all be lost and the victim is at more of a risk for a wound like a bullet you would apply pressure yes
you apply pressure to a wound to stop it from bleeding in the case of a stab where the object is still in tact basic first aid is to leave the object in check if the person is still concious and wait for professional help which they essentially did
great job boc on the edge of my seat and hoping uspor dosent die each character playing their part perfectly cant wait for next week
i love it good storytelling the best part was in the forest where por went out and everyone went to look for him beautiful parts well done every one funny creepy and painful i hope por survive
scary wooooooo
watching it againl am i the only one getting grand guignol vibes
thats what i was getting too
hmm knowing that the actor who plays white is 17its just not sitting right with me
 of us who dont think way too deep into a fictional shows its very simple if you dont like it then dont watch it or interact with anything that resolves around the series
 and that is fine but im sure they dont cast anyone under 17 because its rated nc17 honestly you can look up each title and see the castcrew and most of their biography have the age they are currently and what year they were born just dont ruin it for the rest of us who
 i do appreciate your perspective though
 i did not realize the nc17 i still wont support this project because of nuance issues that comes up with casting minors ex sexualization exertion potential exploitation  ofc there are issues in the acting industry that affect all ages as well
the age of consent is 15 in real life just look it up and i am also from a western country as well and also i think it says nc17 so i understand your concern but this is also not real so dont think too much into it 
 last thing yes i am from a western country and yes i am aware of thailands age of consent but i think anyone who acts in nc scenes should be at least 18 [someone said he was 17 while filming so i just wanted to clear that up still doesnt justify it ]
 if an underage actor cant watch their own series because its age restricted while simultaneously contributing to the reason why its age restricted performing nc scenes maybe they shouldnt be in the series
 i still personally dont agree with this he preformed a sexual scene while being 17 16 irl im not sure when they first started filming
barcode was 17 when they did kinnporsche im sure boc will handle this very well
there are a lot of thai actors who started acting in bl series that were younger than him his parents gave consent thats what matters also fuaiz is not new in the showbiz industry so he knows and his parents know what theyre signing up to
age of consent is different in various countries educate yourself
if he is still 17 while filming he got permission from his parents so they must have trust and confidence in him and others that he will be treated well and with respect
ive never watched thai thriller series but this is making fall from the edge of my seat i cant wait for more episodes
hi
episode 1 was really well done i expected no less from boc and its actors even the new faces horrors dont quite get me but this one had my blood pumping love it quite proud and excited to see the other 11 episodes
