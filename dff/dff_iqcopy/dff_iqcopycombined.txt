this series is really good im just wondering how i missed it earlier but im confused with the ending if they are still at the house what happen behind why they dreaming as though they living good life
i love the series
dannnggg what an ending
and theyre just gonna end it like that now i need to know more
spooky thriller series i kind of knew that even if the entire cast dies two characters will survive in the end maybe from my sixth sense or because i have read similar novels as i exactly guessed jin and phee as survivors   but did not expect the next twist after that
yall cant leave us on a cliffhanger like that
barcode and copper are beautiful
i like white i really do but what is his purpose cause all this whining is just to much 
nong barcode best actor of the year
ive had enough of phee jin is despicable they r a good pair
tee deserves a good life he has been through a lot too
me watching the supposed to be romantic scene of teewhite with full harbored hatred he doesnt deserved any happiness for what he did to non his family condition isnt an excuse he shall b damned in hell of guilt for the rest of his life others too
spare white he is inoccent
why non be dead he need justice why u killed him in this episode hope all of them die they deserved it
puro halucination nalng tlga
wow my heart his hurting for non i can feel this heaviness on my chest throughout this whole episode i want to cry but i am at work and im trying to hold it in that whole gang needs to go to jail bullying at its worst form
omg another week of rotting  i need to watch the last episode now this is soo
wow okay ive been waiting for new to kill everyone
perfectly done
my heart hurts for non all this because he wanted to have friends and fit in great job barcode because you are playing this character so i am good i cried with you
its true dont judge a book by its covereveryone is to be blame for nons casestarting frm the parents through friend to the boyfriend i dont know of new bt damn he was the one affected most comparing to nonany ways let me not concludecheers to the new boc generation 
soo where are the bae173 teasers
tee n white scenes is just too cute too handle hello boc i need jjfuaiz new series with romcom genre pls
my poor white save him from this shenanigans
kinda feel a bit sympathetic for tee dude literally had no other choices
where is new episode
my favorite scene from dff ep 10 is when fluke confessed that he didnt help non when non was bullied by his friends is because he was afraid that he would be the target of bullying by his friends the amount of guilt he has for non is sincere he also has shown some signs of
worry and care for non deep inside i admit being a bystander of bullying is never a choice fluke is just a kid whos dilligent to study but got into wrong group of friends i wish he would escape the terror and become a doctor to make his mom proud 
i love your reaction  its as if you didnt play a character in that series i cant wait for episode 11
     
      
      
       
   
flash back  
the entire flow of this episode is really interestingfrom tan to new  mio acting is really cool and the whole cast is also performing great really looking forward to what tees uncle have done to kru keng non 
    mvp

fluke seemed like the pressure that had been suppressed for a long time finally broke out his inaction actually made him feel great pressure inside i really feel that bump acting skills have improved a lot and he handles the details very well he really looks like a psycho
tan showed that he would do anything to avenge his brother he was completely desperate to let the bad guys get punished it is impossible to judge whether he did too much  but his choice of revenge at the beginning proved that he could give up everything for non
ok
completely in awe with bumps acting this episode it seriously gave me chills how well he delivered those lines and with such intensity too i truly felt my own heart stop watching it no wonder even douchebag tee folded cannot wait to hear teewhites story in the next ep
     
        
        
ep   
   
       
          
        
best series of the year
i just finished the hidden character dff and i must applaud the entire cast just watching the series alone made me appreciate their talent but watching thc dff made me love each and every one of them and i want nothing more than to see them succeed and grow dff
anyone absolutely obsessed with this this is so well acted and written and ill say it till the day i die its only been two days since episode ten and im already too excited for episode 11 looking forward to another incredible part cant wait
im here for non and non always
wowwww i was in awe this entire episode i didnt expect all these twists this is so so well done and man i think bump is the best actor in this he has been believable from start to finish in this character i really see great things in his future 
i hate how everyone is going against phee already bro wait till the series is done to judge all the characters you guys did the same thing with jin saying its sad he may die because he didnt do anything wrong and now everyone hates him cause he hurt non too
my favorite scene is tan  tops scene because i love how their acting so natural the way mio change his facial expression  the details of his character and i always appreciate all the cast because they played very well to show how guilty they are for treating non badly
           
its crazy how the whole cast except for ta and barcode looks like someone who is already acting in the bl industry
pheenon all the way
    
sadly every character the friends in this series is twisted and wicked  yes even non and im anticipating the revelation of whites involvement in this whole mess will show hes not a good person either what a tragedy 
i understand tan where he come from but he went too little far coz he include uncle for this and for me phee he did well for telling the truth coz that is the right thing he need to do and the rest they deserve it coz the are all accountable for everything happened to non

whew the mess this has evolved into the deeper you go the worse it becomes still low key rooting for tan though well except for killing uncle dan but wow this series really showed how terrible the domino effect can be
 no he said no one would die from the drug lol
 im not sure about jin too lol but if i was phee i wouldve tried to expose tan earlier when dang died because tan is too far gone not that i blame him with everything that happened but tan obviously lied when he confirmed no one would die
i hate that he killed uncle dang too im good with tan taking out everyone else who used and abused non i want white phee and jin still not sure yet to live
this show is really good i love all the twists and turns that happen every week i was rooting for nons brother until he was the one that killed poor uncle dang he was innocent the rest of them are evil but i still think nons brother has gone to far
hold your horse maybe uncle dang too was involve in this mess too early to say anything now
wasnt he the one who drove non top  tee to the uncles even tho he didnt know what was going on why didnt he question that someone was unconscious on his property hes the adult in the situation so he has some responsibility
this episode is very fillery the highlight is definitely fluke and jet being unhinged and tan just staring at fluke while hes hallucinating is so delicious i really have hots for that psycho genius
i dont know what acting workshops does boc have but dammmmm from watching them in the hidden character to this series these guys are killing it
pity on nan
pity on nanpheenan to be not phijin
i dont want to watch it anymorepity on nan he betrayed by phi
thank you fluke fluke channeled me in this episode lol make tee talk fluke is non still alive thats my biggest hope atp i alao hope new gets away with everything cant wait to see whites involvement in all this if any
       
i feel sorry for new
[paused at 415] jin you bastard you yelling at phee for not stopping tan why didnt you stop your s h i t t y friends from bullying non you liked non he was your friend then how could you let it happen you stayed silent and even encouraged him to put up with
 exactly i am loving how non and phee was i want pheenon not pheejin
     
i only feel bad for white he got dragged into everything
same
their are theories going around that white is involved with the plan
pheejin is perfect cp hope they will gone too 
          3 
aingggg benci bet sama yang namanyaaa jin phee top semuanyaaa bejir  kek gak ada salah apapun anjirrlahhhh
i want non to be alive so badly
 yesss i think hes best actor in this series wow
also bump is doing a fantastic job as fluke
ang pogi ni mio
and jin what a horrible human being for phee to equate himself to jin for being justifiably angry and saying something cruel vs jin who was jealous and did something cruel i just kept saying phee you can not be serious  at this point i need non to pop up 
yall im mad well revisit the myriad of reasons why later but in this episode the main reason why is phee m phee on one hand i adore phee but on the other i am livid about his underwhelming reaction to jins confession i was like what
 girrlll im like how in what world are you jealous of statutory rape like even if it appeared to be consensual why would you not talk to non or report the teacher but instead you record and post it on the internet aint no coming back from that no redemption whatsoever
saaaame he looked shocked and disappointed cursed a bit but then it was business as usual
i like it when fluke held white hostage and told tee to reveal the truth when tee reveals the truth nons family got fucked up because they thought non ran away with mr keng tan face was hurt when hearing those words was from jin his family was destroyed and now hes alone
tannew such an evil genius
in short psycho
 wow
only trust tan and phee disappoint us again 
i dont trust psychotic drug addict tan i only trust phee
      
this is so exciting the plot the twist and everything hands down and praises to the writer the actors who made the script come to life and everyone in the production i hope this series wont come to an end i keep on wanting more from this 
omg  can it be next saturday already 
ahhhh this series is so fn good seriously the twists and turns and acting are so damn good i really hope this series and these actors  many of them new  get accolades for this
im curious about what happened to non i feel sorry for her battered face cant wait for episode 11
 0136  switch personality  persona    11
waaaaah the acting
im lost here
maybe i can explain something what do you want to know
me tooi am so confused
  
ugh so lost
 uncovered ver  
i knew itt whiteeeeee
    
i feel annoyed because i think here everyone is bad and i cant trust everyone except nong white maybe but their acting is all amazing 
i hate phee now
new suga you taking too long to unalive these mofos tee needs especially to get it
this ep very emotional everyone started to be honest in this ep and to be honest i was a lil bit surprised by tans character he is very manipulative he can even manipulate phee and the fastest he change his expression really scared me but this is what we called good acting
 especially beat non for no reason he gave them the money he was free then they just decided he must be a spy pisses me off
gosh everything is starting take since but in the end yall all failed non and for the while that knew non didnt drip tye camera should of spoke up a long time ago this pisses me off they beat non and his teacher ass for no reason smh
now i hate phee more then anyone ok i will tell you about my hate list 1 phee jin top tee 2 the rest i wish them a painful death  i do not hate tan poor
no no dont hate phee just yet and trust im pissed too but i think hes just a little confused momentarily it has been 3 years but in the next episode if his wits arent gathered by then or if he stays with jin then yes team phee is canceled
phee youre traitor
looking at next trailer tee helped non and something about white being involved too or maybe white saw tee with non and misunderstood and kill non brain not braining no more
cant wait to watch the next eptik tok had me so worried that this series was gonna be so bad they were so wrong tho its amazing the storyline the characters everything was just perfect and the ending too i absolutely love the way the series ended i need another season to this asap cuz what
i loved this series so much im gonna miss them ttt
this is heart breaking 
i think the ending is implying that everyone died in the house the only thing i found disappointing is that poor white died he was so innocent on in all of this i have to say i dont blame new if someone destroyed my family like they did i would want revenge as well
questo bl thai totalmente diverso dagli altri mi ha entusiasmato vederlo mi  dispiaciuto tanto per non voleva solo essere amico di quei ragazzi ma loro lhanno ingannato ed  morto gli attori molto bravi soprattutto il personaggio di non fantastico lo consiglio
this series is really damn good and the story awesome the actors and we have seen them in other dramas have grown with their acting skills are great recommend it 
me here waiting for the final episode then was like wtf after reading the comments still hopping there is season 2
barcodes acting is soooo good 
sweet adorable  loving teewhite relationship
its open ending so thier is a season 2
i dont know why people are hating phee for me phee is doing right and to think non and phee is broken up a long time a go if you got criticize means you portray the character well
wow props to the whole team the actors did a fantastic job i knew not everyone would like the ending but i did i love a mystery maybe a season 2 please boc make it happen 
loved most of it the actors and all the crew did fabulous it was a bit too gruesomely bloody for my taste in episodes 12 im severely disappointed in the ending wheres the happy ending
yun na yun
maybe theres another ending instore 
sweet tragic heartbreaking
im not ready for this to be over 
what was that ending why did white have to die he did nothing 
thats the ending naurrr
its smooookieeeeemuch respect crewthis ep you nailed itsalute and much respect codeyou deserve the indeed you will harvest what you sow
that ending with phee and jin im totally at a loss now
im so sad rn
this series is so intense i took a break last week and i come back and is back to my stomach in my throat one more episode my gosh boc is out here changing the game 
watdaaaa  thats it  i dont know i feel contented but not so  i cant describe 
was this the last episode
what ano nangyari bat feeling ko bitin
are they still hallucinating or dead
wow esta serie me toco todas mis emociones algo diferente de un bl estoy orgullosa de boc y todos que hicieron esta serie y los chicos que talentosos son todos
best boc show by far
lmao the behind scenes have me too tickled barcode hey non non lmao the ending was good my villainous azz giggled with glee at everyones hallucinations and demise the crazy thing is well never know how it truly ended theyre all still in that house
the most bizarre show ive ever seen
omg why white my heart hurts so bad for him he had nothing to do with anything
what the heck that ending sucked
erm disappointed
wow that ending lmao
    
where is episode 12 
omg this show is unbelievable 1010 from me one episode to go cant wait and thank you thai actors and production team for this amazing series and thank you iqiyi for airing this everybody watch this
when will the finale be released here
as per me i think everyone is to blame from the parents friends brother to the boyfriend except for white but am not surecant stop it hurts
you know the biggest surprise for me is that tee actually had a conscience but it kicked in wayyyyyyyy too late but i do feel bad for tees situation however still doesnt justify anything he did to non
non didnt deserve all that
heh i am in love with how we all blame who for this and that actually this is an unfortunate twist drama but i love it yet i think everyone has their own fault for everything that happened so far including non he let things happen to him and keep going with things
 writing was important enough to him that he was willing to endure all of that to get his foot in the door so to speak which his what he saw this contest as
yessss exactly i wouldve given up on trying to please the por and the rest a long time ago he kept on trying and it led to this not that i put a tenth of the blame on him theres still a little it was tee top and fluke who chose to be horrible people to begin with
when he knew how everyone wasjust saying though  by the way i am really enjoying this very much 
what if all that happened was a one big hallucination tan smoke the cure to wake them all up from it that is why they all faint what if
 this has been my thought from the beginning after watching grand guignol last summer i am hoping we are right 
 how im praying your version is right that would seriously be cool
what if the entire show was nons script to begin with this entire thing was the film they where making non is alive and they are all actually friends and the hidden character is just that a fake film that was written for the real script
it was so difficult to finish i feel sad for non
how did everyone get a affected by the laced cigarette except the person whose actually smoking it make it make sense lol and why did phee just stand there and inhale it when he knows whats in it silly rabbit
maybe he had built up a tolerance who knows
dammmmmmmm teeeeee this all ur fault but i feel bad for u which is crazy
also miobump in the back being all lovey dovey always steal my attention
the way theyre reacting to teewhite scenes sameee tho sameee
i love everyones performance in dff especially mio athens performance hope to see athen more in the future projects 
last ep guilt will kill them all
will white take wrath of new
nong barcode is becoming a great actor esp in drama
disappointed by the series shifting from promised romance and suspense to heavy social drama focusing on systemic failures in education system police and social care really wish to see ta and maybe copper in a true romance bl
lol this series never promised a romance have you been watching since ep 1 when was a romance promised this had dark twisted from the get go
its not focusing on that at all but if thats what you take from it then go ahead
omg the stress this series is so good im so happy we got to see how tee and white met i officially only feel bad for white and non the rest can just go die 
i feel bad for tannew his entire family died from the cruel actions of the group
one thing i have to say is the actor who plays phee has beautiful eyes now wth non is alive i almost cried when i thought he diednow in the next episode he is alivethis show keeps you on the edge of your seat
i think it was a hallucination
phee wants to find out truth what happened to non and wants justice for him phee really hope you not do any mistakes feel sorry for tan he lost his family and still not find non he has nothing left but theres way to get revenge white change tee but feel he has something
next ep get me  non hope you alive and it just phee dream or imagination hope everything solve nonnew and im still pheejin
okay tee and white are sweet together
the adults really failed these kids
facts i havent found 1 likable adult in this entire series
i guess moral of the story is everyone has equal blame and guilti partially called thistee harbored closested emotions for nonso far im loving the twist and turns great job beyond the clouds 
tees side story is just so heartbreaking this series got lots of twists
i want new to kill most of them just let white live and just shoot pee in the shoulder or something
raikantopeni i know there is this competition about pheenon and pheejinbt guys can we jst go with the flow of the series plzwe all know in reality fan service its jeffcode and tacopper this will never change so stop the competition and enjoy this thrilling twist series
 have commented in peace no need for harsh comments if you found my comment harsh to you then am sorry
no one oa talking about the actors were going off the characters the series presented its fine of we debate and discuss a series its what makes it fun if youre bothered by the comments then dont read them i love jeffcode and tacopper
am i the only one who legit has tears because of non my feelings are hurt
youre not alone i really had hope that non would be ok
i will leave this place i am not a loser i am hurting for non that poor sweet baby was put through hell for no reason i truly sympathize with the character i was actually quite annoyed with getting the back story of tee and white i want justice for non
tee has me over here in my feels
white is so adorable
be on cloud really out did themselves with this show way better than kp
be on cloud really out did themselves with this show way better than kp
arghh
im still lost her once again 
man gotta wait till next week this episode focused alot in tee smh lot a back story but damn
no tee no more home for non coz what you did for him is he already died even your life cant pay for it poor non justice for him
holy  the twists  turns keep on coming the emotions that switch on me with tee is crazy his backstory  his relationship with white is  its beyond shtty what he to non but he did his very best to change  resolve what happened next episode looks awesomecant wait
non 
woilahmore tragic than i thought it would be was ready for a slasher with some revenge was not ready to be haunted by nons story and keep thinking of it days later
frankly the ending was fitting they all deserved to die with the exception of white and non non was a victim of atrocious behavior the rest trying to escape responsibility tan is the example of the depths humanity can get to when pushed to the extremes of human viscousness
im so disappointed with the ending wtf
white didnt deserve this 
im gonna need the actors of tee and white to have their own series already  i loved their couple so much
every character except white was so unlikable i wanted them all to die by the end 
gosh i love these writers when jin and phee were at the water in the end and everything seemed too perfect i was like aw cmon this is lame and the writers were like yes it is syke
tee shouldve died instead of white
im so shocked this is actually pretty good ive never seen a horror bl before this needs more credit hope season 2 can come out so ill know what happens
i believe this has to have a season 2  please make phee and jin a couple for real
i had to rewatch because i was confused about the ending i didnt hear someone light something and blow out something the first time now i need to know if tan really died
second time watching the whole season again enjoyed it even more i kinda love cliffhangers on seriesjust hoping there will be more i really want season 2
i finished watching this a while ago but this series was amazing and i cried a lot but i will say i enjoyed it very much
this is damn goodengaging all emotions right from the begining1010 all characters played their so well well done
simply superb it was fantastic and will watch it again 1010 thank you be on cloud for another awesome series to all actors thank you
loved the kinnporsche tiein at the end these kind of behind the scenes are inspiring and satisfying to me it makes me want to go work there and i get interested in the art part more deeply thank you again everyone may you all be healthy and happy
this show is a real gem awesome script really good actors which gave it all for their roles and what a cool and classic horror ending i was so surprised by this show
thats it no more episodes wtf
 my thoughts exactly
boc memang on top tak pernah mengecewakan 
bro noooo white is innocent he didnt deserve to die
rewatched the ep and i think im more emotional this time around who else sobbed at certain scenes  boc i need a happy series after this is it okay to hope 4mins will be even a bit happier 
reflecting on ta and copper its nice to see them grow and the pairing work out id love to see them play adults in a different storyline i feel like they grew as people during the htc and filming process which can be seen in the interviews so far im still watching
i feel like with all the conflicts this series could have been longer it would be interesting to see a season 2 maybe with the other thc people who didnt make this one and barcode because he stole this show i was happy to see perth and hope to see him in other projects
cant wait the season 2
also hello boc pls make a new romcom series for jjfuaiz pleaaaseee
this series has some flaws but i think its a good series kuddos to all actors and staff
what is this this is the special ep
grateful to make it to the end thank you to everyone that made this series happen gym attendance is definitely noticed on the actors barcode  2j was gorgeous yet played a despicable character  i loved the nonlinnear storytelling idea
unsure if this is cultural and given the genre i may have used a wrong word butteachers have a lot of power over students a minor saying yes isnt the same as an adult saying yes i understood as it was presented but couldnt forgive the character
soooooo good cant wait for seaaon 2 please be a season 2
yall cant appreciate that this genre is horrormystery most of the genre have open endings like this this was amazing acting great story that gripped you from beginning to end and kept you on your toes barcode acting is amazing
really terrible what a terrible ending even though i have been a fan of this directors work for over 15 years and his work used to be very interesting of course most of his work is a bad ending and he always talks about somewhat loliness and i see it in this story
 including an ending that is openended but doesnt feel like we have to keep thinking about it damn this is the final arc that brings this shit down into the abyss and then transformed itself into a bgrade american horror movie
this series also has a team of famous thai screenwriters joining in writing the script but i feel that this final episode is extremely mainstream easy to read not fun and too difficult for the actors abilities
what series is this rating 910
this reminded me of a drama with this cliffhanger too cant remember the name
i think familiar like jemputan ke neraka drama malaysiaabout youngsister balas demdam for her sister about bully at school
the story familiar jemputan ke neraka young sister balas dendam to her sister cause her sister get bully at school
is this the ending
wow are they still hallucinating
i dont have an issue with the ending except for the lack of conclusion with what happened to non and the teacher
they both already dead
non died the teachers organs got sold
  
did it have to end on a cliff hanger like this will there be a season 2 to complete the mystery i still dont understand who killed or how non died or every one at that
i  jin n phee but y did white have to die
white
one of the only people that i want to survive died in the hands of his lover rip white he really didnt deserve it
real bro didnt even want to be at the function 
im going to have to give the mvamost valuable actor to barcode because the talent really jumped out in this series the emotions facial expressions ad chemistry are just superb he went above and beyond the call of duty to give a perfect portrayal of non
exactly iam soo proud of him
when jin had his hallucinations was that tee doing him in the shower
i believe it was the tutor
logic would dictate that its new who else knows about the antidote other than new and phee also as i said before jin is the absolute worst the fact that phee is so accepting of what he did irks me and it doesnt seem true to his character jins redemption arc is trash
i feel like tee is the absolute worst he began the trap that non could not get out of in the first place set him up to make it seem like he broke pors camera when it was never him he wouldnt have gotten involved with owing any type of money or even needed that tutor teacher
 im reading the comments and im not understanding what some of you dont understand about the ending phee and jin dont make it out phee realizes that theyre still drugged the better question is who is alive still to light the cigarette 
that is a very good question
justice for white
 agreed
ikr it makes me soo sad white was sooo sweet and didnt deserve any of it
say it again for the people in the back
i love it perfect ending
im sorry i tried to watch it and i just skipped many episodes its too confusing i did not like it i didnt even understand the end
what its an open ending so thier is s2 i fell mix emotion on this series good job guys you play will the character hoping to see ta on more series
this is a master piece everyone did an amazing job its one of the best shows i have seen so far thank you for all the work i am sure we all hope we see a special episode or a second session 
so they just hang us like that 55555
barcode acting was spectacularbut the end is more like unfinished wtf that i just watch
white and phee didnt deserve to die
wtf worst ending ever
the ending left me so triggered just my theory like alice in the borderland  what if phee jin and tee are traumatised with the fact and couldnt get out of their own imaginations while the ones who are dead are make it out alive in need of special episodes to satisfy
was thinking how could jin get let off so lightly  until the end perfect love the idea that they are stuck still loved the show characters and plot barcode is simply stunning  hope we may get a special but lets see 
lets admit it we watch bl for the tension chemistry and kisses between two handsome guys the cast was great featuring a passionate masculine top and two cute attractive bottoms so why the focus on fake blood social problems and evil
because we actually like shows with good story line other than that stufftheres alot of bls out there that only focuses on those things that you can watch if you dont like it theres no need to comment just leave
im satisfied with the ending that none of them survived
im gonna say the cult got tee jinta and phee cuz wtf was that ending bro
this was so bizarre ending  weird started well that lost in translation and confusing
omg whats that though barcode acting was really superb and amazing buthello do we expect season 2 with this kind of ending
the series is better in everything except the ending thats the problem with horrorsuspense storyline sometimes you just dont know how to end it so youll leave it hanging openended jin doesnt deserve to get out there alive or not non and tees acting are 
they did not
missing people dead bodies and no one is found no investigation i feel like none of it really happened but how was it actually a company making a movie  we just watched their movie or was it all a psychotic dream from one of the boys mind blowing to try and understand it
its open ending so its depend on what u want to believe for me it might be phees dream all along from ep1 til the end  so no one are ever existed from the start
  
i just hoped that there are more eps or longer eps for scenes
this is not your typical cliche bl series i appreciate a different presentation of bl with an in depth discussion that not only runs on romance but also personality mh family friends norms and environment i am glad that they were able to tackle a lot 22
maybe we will have additional eps maybe i want answers as to where non is i felt jin fluke top and white wasnt given depth in their back stories that is why character development is lacking i just felt that some parts were lacking but this is a great series 12
why white have to die he was innocent worst ending
im sorry i dont like the endingit there another episode
what the hell i was mad the whole episode well except top getting killed that was nice to see
the ending was a big cliffhanger i need a new season or something
i got so tensed up in this episode but the ending confuses me like what do you mean theyphee jin and tee didnt left the house
bruh there better be a sec 2 cuz i cant accept this ending
i hope theres special episode
a chaotic ending to an intriguing story but the guys did a good job especially bump and barcode i look forward to their next moves
 had me right up until the ending  that shxt was not thought out properly 
this series was epic even the ending left me speechless you have to be a hardcore mysteryhorror fan to get this series ever episode was meticulously thought out and leaves you wanted more your emotions is all over the place but in a good way 
ye
all the actors played their roles very well their acting skills were very good the visualization of this series is also very good and detailed i hope there will be a 2nd szn bcs the end of this szn is open ending and there are still many questions on my mind
im disappointed
 thats all i got
wtf
the ending confused me a lot but according to my theory phee jin and tee never left that house i wish tan and white hadnt died thats the part i was most upset about it was so sad
dff ep 12 was chaotic and horrific even though im sort of glad its over im glad i watched it it really kept my attention
whaaaat
this has to be the stupidest series i have ever watched i wouldn even give it one star what a waste of time the story is so confusing you cant even follow it
same here ive wasted my money and time only for this series ive taken membership im disappointed
same here that was the biggest waste of my time and energy barcode deserves better cant wait to see him with jeff satur
one of the best bl i have seen
white should have made it out of there he was completely innocent he had nothing to do with any of it
true
okay and again the question where is non playboy the actors were good thats all the good that can be said okay direction and music story no comment
what the hell i hate the ending so frustrating
this is really bad like iggy azalea bad
iggy isnt bad tho so theres that
 huh 
i bet i can watch this series 10 times and still be confused
what just happened here 
idk 
worst finale in history
i need a special episode stat
this has become one of my all time favorite bl dramas i need more tacopper dramas
wow just wow i didnt like it at first cuz i didnt get where it was going but im so glad i stuck with it that scene where phee and new were fighting was soooo good im so proud of them they did such a good job and i cant wait for season 2
i laughed so hard when top and fluke died on the stairs  i hope tee is forever tormented so are ogee and jin alive or dead all in all i really enjoyed this series
 i think the teacher was killed before non they had mo use for him i also think phee is still hallucinating
what happened to the teacherwas the teacher the policeman who got hit by the cari am so confused 
stupidest drama ive ever watched barcode deserves better than this shit show cant wait to see his drama with jeff satur at least hell be the main lead
the ending caught me off guard 
why white at least it looks like there might be a 2nd season soooooo gooood
what happened are phee and jin dead too
who knows
well done boys very good acting bravi the plot the directing and all  almost touch the good scandinavian noir movies i wish most of the thai bl moviesseries were as good kudos to all involved
what kind of ending is that did they die or not 
so non really did want revenge even on phee who he cheated on  poor innocent white
 exactly
bro the ending made me so mad like wtf
are you kidding me this is the ending horrible show
white is innocent 
what
also i still say bump was the vip of the series i fully believed his character from start to finish he never held anything back
woof that ending wow at first i was upset but that ending just made everything better congrats to the whole team this series is so good the actors definitely did their best and the storyline was great
ok that made no sense this entire show
honestly wtf
wtf
wth happened i am confused
i swear if barcode doesnt win any awards for his acting in this i will sue they all did an amazing jib but code went all out you can see his hard work and dedication in this series
it can not end like this we have to get more i cant accept the possibility of the three biggest traitors and liars possibly making it out alive
i had to finish it but i dont like it i am guessing they are all dead and they still say what happened to non as to how he died or tee is the only one that survived either way i didnt like this one
wth
newbis drgging them to death
here we go again 
poor white i feel bad for himperfect for this spooky time of year
i want to rewatch this series but the mistresmt and absolutely no justice for non hurts and pisses me off well there is some justicebut still
i am crying  this is hands down the funniest shit i have ever watched i started wheezing like a smoker with a 2 pack a day habit when they had to twerk seeing the blindfold on the plastic pony had tears running down my face they all have a career in comedy
this show actually makes sense and is kind of fun and charming if you pretend its a tabletop rpg and all the characters are being controlled individually by funny nerds trying to make the game interesting
im just waiting for the dm to remind all of them that they left their friend alone on a couch with a stomach wound that is bleeding out
where can i watch the next prince
is not out yet
this is so sad  why did they have to get white involved he didnt do anything to deserve that he is the only innocent in the story 
technically phee is innocent too yeah were all collectively pissed about him and non but truth be told phee had a justifiable reason to be upset him falling for jin is poor judgment but not a crime
i loved it but i need a second season it cant end like that
yes need that second season
i hope jin and phee to have a good ending jin dont suffer anymore
but why its only for vip why we have to pay money omg
barcode is still the best
has got to be a definite top three
so u mean 2 tell me  they r still in that damn house
if phee could have kept that same energy that he had 2437 because jin was talking that nonsense and phee had that boy please  smirk on his face he could have gotten the truth out of jin and we could have been up outta there by episode 2
disappointed that they didnt mention barcode at all
they didnt talk about barcode what is going on they mentioned 2j and ta is from kp and how they improve like barcode is not from kp also barcode is one of the best in dff  
dff was so good it brought out so many emotions from me everyone did an amazing job thank you for this masterpiece of a series
por is still miraculously alive
  
we need a second season where its revealed non faked his death and white survived ambiguous ending here 
why did they not mention barcode at all its sad bcs hes literally in almost every scene did the editor cut it out
thats what i said its pretty weird its like they are trying to take attention away from barcodenon
barcode acting so insanely amazing
i really enjoyed this series all the actors were incredible wish there could be a part 2 where all the dead haunt the house and and forest 
mini blue
this episode is so intense but what the f was that then ending is so confusing
didnt really like the ending here too bad they didnt make more episodes to wrap it up its not complete like i said the ending doesnt make any sense and its uncompleted
love it
im sorry but are we going to get an explanation did non really die bro i was hoping he faked his death and got out of there im sorry but 12 episodes arent enough wheres the rest at
o like kp
all plays were amazing but barcode stole the whole show he was amazing this serie is the perfect combination of drama horror mystery and romance i cant wait to watch the bocs new projects
copper phuriwat 
this drama is a not story probably the fact the that everyone learn lesson thank you for uploading and thank you for director and producer and writer from pakistan
this one as good is non really dead waiting for last ep
first i want to say perth i see you now on to the show im glad tee did all he could for non its the least he could do im sick to my stomach thinking that non had a miserable life then a miserable death were is the fvcking justice bro
omg where is ep 11 im dying no pun intended
avengar
thank you mile and pond for nurturing this group thank you to everyone who made this show happen its ok to cry its ok for people to be attracted to whomever their attracted to im enjoying watching the progression and competition of the show lovely idea 
    mvp
love you guys
the scene i liked the most in dff ep10 was when tannew was still very calm when pheejin told him that he was nons brother and came to find out or get revenge because they not only made the younger brother disappear but his family fell apart
so not cool no english subtitles
i really like the part where tee started telling about what happened to non after nong whites life is being threatened it really shows how he did not want white to be implicated into this situation just because he is tees boyfriend
the amount of sadness i feel for non and it all started over a camera this series is too good
innocent jin  he doesnt anything while he likes it rough 
i dont realy get all the hate reactions couse i love the acting and the complot so much   
not him laying there with a branch in his stomach just on the couch and not at the hospital 
dude there is a murderer trying to kill them they cant go anywere
i love them
the logic isnt logicing i wish they would get better writers i hate when a great plot is ruined by lazy writing dont touch the body what if you leave dna oh but we touched the bike all g we will vouch for you 
no offense but who the hell cares if somebody tried to murder them or not their friend is dying istg and they decided to sit in the living room to find proof for what
well that sends it how dude know the guys just went to sleep upstairs aint one dead in a bathroom
bad acting messy story irrational reations of each characters who the hell wrote the script 
epe2
watching the first episode again makes it more enjoyable because of so many revelations that unfold from the recent episode 9 things from the prior episodes are making more sense now
k im starting to think they killed barcodes charcter
the funny thing is even when theyre sad and panicking about por they still took off their shoes when entering the house xd
asians do out of regular practice its like your body does automatically no need to think to do or not
i cant find the reactions pls anyone knows where to watch them reacting to the eps
its the special clips after each episode
i dont believe with phee anymore now im just feel bad for tan  i hope at the end only tannew and non
im so addicted tt
my pheejin 
only trust tan and the ending should be non and new reunion  living happily together
nons family is so complicated a whole mess
   
im shockedd 
newtan lost his entire family cause those 5 boys they gotta go thats it im done
when ep 9
where is episode 9 
this movie is very enjoyable and interesting
my favorite episode is episode 7 from the beginning of the episode i felt a lot of things in it until the episode was over
thats true
the most complete episode because we feel love happiness destruction despair confusion anger hurt put together by actors who are very good at playing scene after scene so that i as a viewer can feel all these things in one beautiful episode in episode 7
god i couldnt stop crying for non and i really start balling when his dad slapped him barcode you did an amazing job hats off young man everyone is doing a top tier job its been awhile a bl made me cry or feel emotions like this and so far this year theres only 2
i want to know who killed the teacher i want white mios character and phee to live however i need white to see who his boyfriend tee really is fluke and the bully crew can all get what they deserve
i want white tan and phee to still be alive the others can all suffer
i think the thug uncle did something to the tutor im hoping he has the tutor and non working off their debt somewhere and non can escape i hope they werent unalived
this is crazy i bet tan is nons brother new im ready for everyone to dje including the thug azz uncle i only want to see white phee and tan walk away from thisand the killers if its not them shrugs i said what i said and i want non to still be alive
  something or someone bumped it my accident had jin not recorded it and set up the upload thia still wouldnt have been an issue
 ooo he was there he mightve but fluke is the see nothing know nothing type why would he get involved now we saw jin about to upload it but we didnt see him press the button if its not jin then its flukepr some freak accident like jin left the mouse over the button and
 i think fluke uploaded the video fluke sees everything but says nothing and why would he be so afraid if he didnt do something more serious than just be apart of the friend group and know some secrets
 ooo i like this theory too i honestly think jin recorded and uploaded the video just to expose him he liked non then he saw him with phee then he saw him with the tutor and was like nope not gonna cheat and still be happy and i cant even have it
i want white and phee to live also however im thinking non may try to kill phee and jin because of the leaked video and phee and jin having a relationship we still dont know the direct reason why jin recorded and uploaded the video nothing good was coming out of that
what happened why it isnt available here anymore 
pheenon
hoyyyy gagi ang galing ni ta
i never thought that non would be able to hurt my handsome phee
i can never recover from this episode traumatised for life
pheejin
well my pheenon just crashed  and jin bawling his eyes out while posting the video is he jealous and angry sigh this is so complicated i cant stand seeing non this sad anymore
is wah this i ready for the next episode
i cant still think of the plot its such a nice story
phe and non look cute and everything but phe  jin are just on another levelthe tension between them is just fire that being said l think phe should end up with jin
i feel phee should remain single although jin isnt as bad as some of the others he still filmed non and allowed it to be made public i mean if he hadnt recorded non in the first place there wouldnt of been a video to leak
did not expect that  the love triangle and the betrayal cant wait for next episode seems to me that someone is out for revenge
start
niceeeeeee
ooomggggg
my scary ass needs to watch this in the day time
the masked man might be phee he wants revenge for non  if i were the one who got bullied like that i did the same to them
non and phee nobody expected that what how when where dude i need an explanation now
ngl i thought tee was innocent since he was just quiet the first half but nvm hes just as bad lol
i dont care if this ship is doomed from the start i will still go down with it 
this is a romance right
where are the sub
why is tee so mean to non
l love the chemistry of ta and copper
not even a minute in ep 1 and i see an axe blood and dudes running while screaming what the
por 
at first i had suspicions about phe and tan but after episode 4 i became doubtful but in this episode phes suspicions return could he be new 
got to admit im loving how copper and barcode act together they seem so comfortable with one another
my sweet non kill them all they deserve a painful death
omg 
this series is a little bit out of the context until now i understand nothing bored
you could be a little patient and wait for more context there are still 6 episodes left
this series make me scream out but at the same times they friendship and love really cute 
amazing loved the story and the characters the actors were on point
fluke is so cold idk what to think omg
i need to know what they did to non before i get myself any more attached to these characters ffs jin i have faith in you pretty boy dont let me down
fluke was doing way to much cant wait for him to die with his blindself xoxo gossip girl 3
hmm  not scary at all im not watching
your choice its nice though i wanna find the truth
 ep  
fluke hopefully you are next 
i cant stop watching this bl  its got me addicted to it
it seems to me that tee has sacrificed himself phi is my hero i hope that he and jin will survive and be together thanks to boc for a very intriguing series 
good
love the username
l only know ta so lam still trying to remember who is who but the boy playing tan is asking way too many questions about what happened to nondont know if its curiosity or something else
   
barcode 
really fun cant wait for the next episode
 sunday
what day ddf updated 
the production is good the story is very interesting to follow cant miss watching an episode
okay watching them reacting to ep3 makes me suspect fluke more 
i have a bad feeling with nong copper
naay chemistry si tan ug si jin 
best episode yet im amazed at the acting i was so into this episode fluke scared the shjt outta me he was perfect the main person i want to survive this is white i also love that the 2 lovers are stuck in a box lol they have plenty of time to talk their bs out lmao
 i spell it like that to not get deleted 2 of my comments have been flagged and taken down
 but you could read it couldnt you
you spelling is wrong
what is there in watching a friends old school film that right away would make a group of people have such kind or reaction i can understand after viewing it but right before director got ahead of himself
how can i watch this without vip
you cant here
you must hack it
     
 
naqaab film
the fact that they have por laying on the couch overnight with a mother friggin tree in his gut and still alive is wild
theres something fishy about the drink they had
the kids forgot about the phonelandline
it doesnt work they point it out in ep 1
hi
why does it seem like all the partners are men or gays
it literally has an lgbt tag
its called bl boys love series
because its a show about gay people
because its a bl series
this is turning out to be a good horrorbl series im also proud of the boys coming from hidden character to this series theyve come a long way and their acting has improved a lot
wow this is great so far everyone has really improved from the reality show i love jj and fuaiz so much  ta and copper are doing well too im super proud of this cast
paling seneng sama karakter white disini pemberani dia
wow so if i cant take ways side why are the director making charlie and babe selfish aholes and way the one babe runs to when charlie breaks his heart than be pushed on the side ways not selfish in the beginning but when you keep being kicked eventually you attack back
you do know this is not pit babe right
wrong series
are you in the right comment section
wow all of them are really bringing their acting skills to life uncle dangrip i feel like we are going to lose por next i dont want to lose you so early us even though you are only lying on the couch you are doing it so beautifully

patiently waiting for ep 2 lol
how is es 2 
i really loved barcodes performance 
wow keeps on getting better of all 2023 dramaaction bls this is the most exciting story is complex tense amazing cast i think this must have a good budget to have such a dedicated team in front of and behind the camera and to have 13 ep 50 min ea
it was too scary

thai drama eng sub movie dead friend forever the series dff
i think this is the first bl series that ive watched for the side couples sky and venus are just boring and childish vee is so immature and downright bipolar with the way he acts sky is borderline psycho stalker
 wrong
im not on series somehow i was watching venus and sky but for some reason the comment came on this series i know who belongs to which series
this is dead friends forever not venus in the sky
venus in the sky gets a lot better after vee stops being stubborn and bjtchy be prepared for the nc scenes they get realistic af id watch again for that alone lmao
 yeah when writing a comment if you dont pause the show it will move to the next show and when you hit send it will post under the new shows comment section its done me like too
huh 
wrong series 
there are no characters named vee and sky in this series i think you are on the wrong series
i dont like it
this is amazing such a great job im so proud of my babies ta and code love them so bad
their reactions to the nc scenes lmaooo
copper is such a pretty boy
so far this series made me laugh than made me scared lol im intrigued with the situationship going on with phee and jin
i like it
this was sooo good so far
its too scary for me 
i found some scenes very akward and its not even the boys acting i think they are doing fine but the pauses and the way these scenes were organized no fluidity at all i really hope the next episodes are better because i had high expectations for this series
for me its good though
this plot is so good and all the cast is amazing i am rewatching bcz i love this genre so much cant wait for next episode 
wrong turn  bl version 
nice
one of the basics of first aid that anyone should know is to apply pressure to a wound especially one so significant make it more realistic unless all those boys are dullard and the woods are meant to be dark make it dark itll make it even creepier
sure but when there is a situation like this one never pull it out because when you do the blood that was being stopped by the object will all be lost and the victim is at more of a risk for a wound like a bullet you would apply pressure yes
you apply pressure to a wound to stop it from bleeding in the case of a stab where the object is still in tact basic first aid is to leave the object in check if the person is still concious and wait for professional help which they essentially did
great job boc on the edge of my seat and hoping uspor dosent die each character playing their part perfectly cant wait for next week
i love it good storytelling the best part was in the forest where por went out and everyone went to look for him beautiful parts well done every one funny creepy and painful i hope por survive
scary wooooooo
watching it againl am i the only one getting grand guignol vibes
thats what i was getting too
hmm knowing that the actor who plays white is 17its just not sitting right with me
 of us who dont think way too deep into a fictional shows its very simple if you dont like it then dont watch it or interact with anything that resolves around the series
 and that is fine but im sure they dont cast anyone under 17 because its rated nc17 honestly you can look up each title and see the castcrew and most of their biography have the age they are currently and what year they were born just dont ruin it for the rest of us who
 i do appreciate your perspective though
 i did not realize the nc17 i still wont support this project because of nuance issues that comes up with casting minors ex sexualization exertion potential exploitation  ofc there are issues in the acting industry that affect all ages as well
the age of consent is 15 in real life just look it up and i am also from a western country as well and also i think it says nc17 so i understand your concern but this is also not real so dont think too much into it 
 last thing yes i am from a western country and yes i am aware of thailands age of consent but i think anyone who acts in nc scenes should be at least 18 [someone said he was 17 while filming so i just wanted to clear that up still doesnt justify it ]
 if an underage actor cant watch their own series because its age restricted while simultaneously contributing to the reason why its age restricted performing nc scenes maybe they shouldnt be in the series
 i still personally dont agree with this he preformed a sexual scene while being 17 16 irl im not sure when they first started filming
barcode was 17 when they did kinnporsche im sure boc will handle this very well
there are a lot of thai actors who started acting in bl series that were younger than him his parents gave consent thats what matters also fuaiz is not new in the showbiz industry so he knows and his parents know what theyre signing up to
age of consent is different in various countries educate yourself
if he is still 17 while filming he got permission from his parents so they must have trust and confidence in him and others that he will be treated well and with respect
ive never watched thai thriller series but this is making fall from the edge of my seat i cant wait for more episodes
hi
episode 1 was really well done i expected no less from boc and its actors even the new faces horrors dont quite get me but this one had my blood pumping love it quite proud and excited to see the other 11 episodes
ok the plot is good im into it lets goooooooo
episode 1 was really well done i expected no less from boc and its actors even the new faces horrors dont quite get me but this one had my blood pumping love it quite proud and excited to see the other 11 episodes
episode 1 was really well done o i expected no less from boc and its actors even these few faces
boc has once again confirmed its reputation a great series an interesting story good acting im really looking forward to the continuation of the series
its a different bl series and i like it i like the horror theme  i didnt expect the love scene of 2 partners  but i like it its intense
i need to watch more episodes then i will review it ep1 its okay  the black thing is really creepy surely giving me goosebumps each time its appear next episode ill be waiting for it
so glad boc did another series  everyone is doing great 
wow this is scarybut i like it
im already hooked but to wait a whole week on each episode  this is going to be some looong weeks 
these children have been learning some things from their dad actor especially the little intimate scenes im very surprised that theyre doing it and theyre doing it pretty well
are they all gonna end up dead 
this is so scary wtf the mask is scary
this is interesting seated for more tacopper
im so hooked now 
be on cloud is out here trying to change the game being different kinnporsche dff lets go
home from work i can finallly watch the series ive been waiting for for so looong 
not me thinking it was a supernatural ghost story type series  its a slasher 
ill hook up on this series thanks boc after so many years of waiting for a good series its worth waiting for so long after kinnporsche
dff not bad i cant really judge untill i have seen more episodes 
if barcodtins character is the one hunting them down then imma support him unconditionally go on non kill them hes such a slay fr 
watching this alone is not a good idea for me how can i sleep now  congratulations on this the actors did a great job 
glad to see bts to ease the audience mind
where is the location looks creepy as well
dff is finally here omg
finally 
creepy romance omothis is when id personally pack my things and leave as fast as i could 
i am so confused about how he survived so long with something through his stomach aint no way that didnt hit something vital right
its because they didnt remove it from its stomach so its keeping him from bleeding out and dying immediately also the stick is kinda holding everything together for now so thats why he needs help within two days
movie series 
bruh i dont think i can commit to the watching all the episodes
            
copper is liza soberanoa male version
really i dont understand this series
barcodes acting 
a modern and fresh series with a lot of twist very beautiful
i wanna fight all of them because how dare yall treat baby barcode that way 
the uncle get his head lobbed off but tee and top drive off no problem 
ta is sooooo hot 
im ready for nong barcodes goat acting
  
this shi is actually rlly scared me lmao kuddos to the production teams and the actors they did a good job
same
oh my god 
be on cloud did not disappoint this series the actors and staff are amazing i am really going nuts about fluke talk about nervous to psycho in one episode 
why am i suddenly most scared of the doctor 
subtitles are not available in english
they are thats how i watch it
these people do not seem concerned enough about their dying friend and the dead uncle  if they really wanted to help por theyd seriously try to run away
the only thing i dont like is that they didnt even think that as long as por is not getting into the hospital the more hes dying but i am instilling in my mind that those boys are kids and maybe really scared of the  ghost 
ghost or hallucinations or men taking revenge cant wait to see what happens next
so are all those encounters just hallucinations
im mad it too tan to look at his phone and see white to remember he has a person to take care of lol butthole im even more mad that nobodys tried to ride for help for porlike come on uncle dan made it all the way toting take out plates but yall cant
im even even more mad that uncle dan came on his scooter and not his truck im waiting to see how this plays out cause im suspicious of everyone even the new friends
love this so far
white deserve a big applause in this episode really felt bad for him
i really like this series it is very refreshing to see that they would make a horror bl the acting is goodwhy is nons nicknameenglish translated sticky bug in this version while in the actual episodes its greasy
its actually wild that most of these guys are in this show because they won an acting competition
just like kinnporsche the shock factor is amazing the amount of twists in the show are crazy there is so much unexpected stuff that happends this is now in my top 10 bls boc definitely makes great shows that was proven yet again
love pheejin
im waiting on english subtitles too 
      
where is the english sub
phi ta ur are the mysterious guy ur are mr are planning tale revenge for barcode or u are the one cause barcode death
this iss soo gooddd canttt wait to watchh the next epsss
the fact that they left without caring anyone else one has a boyfriend and the other has best friends apparently i understand they are scared but i you so called care for the others then actually help 
still good so far tho
people really need to watch this series each episode has me on the edge of my seat i am sad por died but the coming episodes are flashbacks so whoohoo
im kinda feel sad for white dude is innocent and confused af but also got yelled the most
fluke creeps me out can he be the next to ho bye bye
nong fuaiz being the damsel in distress
i started watching for barcodewhen will he get more screen time but now im watching for tacopper as well also fluke needs to chill hes scary
ive stopped watching this series the acting is not good and the story line is to far fetched was looking forward to this series but was disappointed in it after kinnporche series being so good was expecting better but hey other ppl may enjoy just not me 
what the duck happened 3 years ago tell us already
fluke is honestly more scary then the mask man
i cant believe my mans is still laying up on this couch with a tree in his gut homie should be dead by now 
what the hell is this 
this is good huhuhu the ghost is also cute im so whipped in ghost
so cute 
waiting at the edge of my seat to find out who is the masked killer  big scaredy cat here but enjoying how its going 
is it just me or does anyone else feel like tan has an ulterior motive like maybe hes there to find out what happened to non specifically or maybe hes helping him
im enjoying this but i think they all still have a lot of learning to do so far the only naturalish actors are ta fuaiz mo  us fuaiz is pretty good in this episode  if ta could loosen up a bit hed appear more natural but hes still good
i loving this episode but the ghost on the motorcycle was just hilarious
im sorry but the scene at 1526 its the funniest thing ive ever seen it had me dying laughing the way masked killer threw the ax 
i feel like one of the boys is in on it with the killer but i may be wrong
i feel this way too
acting is a littlehmmmmm many weird plot holes coming from the same company that made kinnporsche i had high hopes but i will keep going cus im still intrigued not many horror y series out there at all
rewatched the first episode i noticed fluke was looking rly rly suspicious hmm
someone in that group is the killer right right
i think in the end its just going to be all an act they improved on their past mistakes this time around we shall see
but it doesnt match with the timing unless there re 2 masked man one is outsider or on  one from the group
i felt bad for white poor baby was just there scared for his life i give pros him bc i couldnt act a scene where theres a gun pointed at me and get scream at i would have a straight panic attack
my brain cant conclude a theory in this series its so good that i suspect everyone is invovle lkasdfjksaf
lmao i dont wanna sound rude but they acting is kinda terrible or is it just me
im havent figured anything out yet could be anybody
we are only on episode 3 episode 3 how am i going to make it to 12 the anxiety this is good stuff
oh how i love bl series that have a bigger idea for a plot than just a love story  like ones that have boys love in it while not being the central idea of the plot aka horror bl or bl with special abilities in it
 which could it be where the cast is all full of babes and the plot keeps thickening keeping us on our toes enjoying the new genres 
white could not have girlbossed any harder 
why do i sort feelsomebody is actually reshooting the same movie they did earlier
brosame
i am loving this
lots of blood and scary stuff 
this show is so fun and good
this keeps impressing me this cast is great 
its not kind to leave us hanging like this i dont think i can wait a week for the new episode this show is incredible
what if its not barcode non cant wait to actually see him in the next ep
if they actually show usi am only on episode 4 and this is already too hard to watch i dont know if i can continue
jj has changed i see more confidence and comfortable selfexpression i love to see it
lovely acting all im glad i saw the first hidden character theyve improved barcodes acting  the range id prefer less on the bed scene with ta and copper theyre playing minors here so  the toy rocking was 
i wanna punch fluke
 2        
 aggressive    aggressive    
 ep4     
  
       
tbh i love every episode but ep 4 is my favorite episode because this ep hit different  this episode has very interesting and challenging plot  starting from the scene of the kids going to the temple to find top then showing one of the mask killers to the tense 
 moreover in this episode we can see and get to know more deeply about every charachters personality in this current situation like flukes personality fluke seem like having calm character but from this ep we can know that hes not that calm  hes very emotional character
 and for phee surprisingly he has calm character even tho he has to faced a tense situationthis ep is very appropriate to be used as a transition between present  flashbacks bcs at least we already know a lil bit about the personality of each character in this series
omyghadddddd i love the plotttt
fluke is studying to be a doctor why didnt he expose the wound to fully exam it and he trying to sew it with the top on
the series is full of inconsistencies like why are his hands stained after washing the blood off in the real world blood doesnt stain skin
like bruh im a mess over here my baby barcode 
i need something happy to watch now to ease my mind im still reeling ugh
jjay and fuaiz are so cute together  i cant wait to see how their characters story unfold in dff
unfolded like a beautiful dumpster fire its so sad but thats karma
i thought non was still alive but if phee is doing things with jin it means non really is dead from the preview of next weeks it looks like phee would never do anything to hurt non as in cheating
screaming jin likes non phee is with non and the teacher  i wonder which of the friend groups is also in on it barcode with the rizz now if jeff shows up 
omg im shcoked about non and phi like wtf so they was boyfriend before and jin has crush on non its esay to see but in the end after non dead phi and jin are in relationship thats kind funny btw i cant support tee por and top attitude can i push them 
please do lol
not gunna like the bullying is pissing me off  which i guess is a compliment to the actors because they are doing a good job at portraying a bunch of jerks
tee and top are on my hit list for what they did fluke too because he sat there and watched them set non up from start to finish whole group was either too lazy  arrogant to come up with any ideas of their own  treated him like trash robbed me of my jinnon ship too 
fluke bro they legit said it wasnt your fault and top killed por but now youre holding them at gun point make it make sense
fluke reminds me of the kid who was obsessed with grades in duty after school
ok i have a new theory this whole thing was orchestrated by jin for non jin was about to go abraod and they wanted to spend a weekend of partying to say goodbye he convinces por to use his house gather the crew and the killing began as his finally im sorry bro to non
tee por and the other one deserve the karma 
scratch that even jin
 except jin
they all do
i was feeling sorry for what was happening to them until this episode they deserve it 
i know white was low key dumb for looking at the video not that i dont understand why he did it with all the secrets these people are keeping to themselves but i feel so bad for him hes clearly such a soft boy and innocent of all of this
non copper is the most suspicious dont be fooled
fluke when i catch you
now i want them to die asap  except jin
even jin
i hate bullies its so hard to watch non being bullied this is hard to watch but i want non to have his revenge jin please keep protecting non
 yes
is non barode
barcode is so freaking handsome dude 
now im wondering what else did they do to non because when top killed por he made it seem like he knew they did terrible shjt and they deserve to die he made it seem like he didnt have any involvement but this all kicked off when top broke pors camera and tee covered it up
i instantly dislike the whole friend group except jin
im only rooting for 2 or 3 to make it out alive one of them is white because he didnt have anything to do with it
omg i hate when everybody hate one person when he did nothing wrong and we see that non got some medicine and i think he got depression something like that i really hate when naon got accused about the camera when he was top who broken thats make want to push them in their
faces and i think jin and naon got a relationship naon had a big feeling for jin is easy to see anyway i really hate tee top and por they are so horrible i just want to give a big hug naon
fluke is evil i havent put any kind of trust into him since the first episode he always gives me a serial killer psycho vibes
where is ep 5
this was such a good episode i cant wait to see if non really is the killer or not
fluke is getting on my mfkn nerves
i need fluke to goneeee for good
tee come and get yo man my poor baby
wow the mvp of this episode is bump his acting is so good here i really like ta and coppers acting too i wasnt a huge fan of them in thc but they are doing a really great job 
i didnt watch thc before this so i was really surprised that bump had no acting experience
im so obsessed with this series  every week is harder to have to wait for a new episode
each episode is better and better last episode fluke scared me this time top scared the heii out of me lol im loving this series and the reaction videos are so good the guys are funny im ready for episode 5 lol
i know the dude had an axe and is creepy looking but there were 4 of them they could have easily over powered him in that scene instead they ran away ugh
i give up too much gore not into that
well yea you can tell just by the title that its a horrorsuspense series
fluke needs to go
tee is just as bad
agree
           dffep4
fluke selfishhhh
am literally obsessed with this series  just the best 
this series is a far cry from the quality of kinnporsche the plot has so much potential but screenplay and execution are quite disappointing i hope it gets better in the next episodes
you would think that with three of the actors from kinnporsche in this it would be that good i still like it though
 
i am ready for barcode
all in favor of fluke being the next to go say i
the behind the scene clips at the end  is hilarious 
i really enjoyed this ep even if some parts in the house seems to be a lil dragged nice to see some tacopper scenes and i am so hyped for the next ep  barcode
fluke is scarythis was genuinely the most heartbreaking episode so far seeing non constantly manipulated and bullied was so hard to watch not to mention fluke being complicit in the bullying ughh makes my skin itch lets just hope theres a silver lining in the form of jin 
love how everyone in the comments is saying that they feel so bad for non which i do too like this poor man just wanted friends and ended up getting taken advantage of so much then theres also me an actual writer saying yeah thats thats the writing process
also genuinely think that only the ones who hurt non should be killed like leave white alone leave phee and jin and tan alone it should only be the original guys who die like tee top fluke all them should die not the others
does anyone else think the guy that plays tee looks a bit like mew im really enjoying this so far i love non and white jin seems ok at the moment and so does phee
okay wait this actually just got interesting
teachers pet
i also do the head hitting thing when im stressed
there is no bts scene
 5555
seeing this episode i can somehow say they deserve to suffer
wow barcode played the role beautifully heart went out for non and white non was put through hell and white was innocent everyone hurt non directly or indirectly no one left that house
 26       
oh my gosh
 ep5            
like i literally dont like anyone atp
they were so awful to non omg
serem banget cukyyyy aku nonton pake layar kecil aja udah merinding bombay
what a bunch of ahs non is helping them with their project and they treat him like crap they dont even call him by his name i hope whoever is after them makes them pay
theyve done an excellent job of creating a whole bunch of pretty despicable characters for this story yikes im sure there are a bunch of plot twists to come but its startling how many bad decisions can be made by a small group of people
i cant watch this poor non
man i dunno anymore just when i think i have a solid theory something else happens and im back go square one lmao
why non the only one got hurt poor non
this should be called everyones mean to barcode
this is so fxck up
non why phi was such a good boyfriend had all high hopes for jin but posting that was a hugh invasion thats left there for everyone to see and what was he mad for they not dating phi reaction warranted but he made it sound like it happened before
top tee if only i was that masked killer i
damnpor is an asshole but tee and top should have been the first ones i would have taken out fluke didnt participate but i still dont like him jin is showing more concern and crush on non phi and non as lovers my ghostship ta and barcode 
tabarcode
barcode you did a very good job from kinporsche to dffyoull grow up to be a very fine young man keep it up gonna wait and see your next project
dawgg tee is the worst 02
jj likes bc copper likes bc ta likes bc bc is the luckiesunluckiest guys here
bow i get it one is domestic violence one is peer pressure one is illegal tansaction nice back story
tee uncle is doing money laundering huh
u see top n tee is the worst kind of human ever
 what a twist wasnt vibing that teacher at all and i feel sorry for jin he was the only one that was actually being nice and helping non cant wait for next episode 
so por is the only child and he died
cant wait for tacode 
hmmm phee and non i am kinda feel sad and disappointed because i love pheejin lets see what will happen i wonder if phee still use jin in the present or actually care about him
wow tee and top did non dirty  interesting back story
this episode was surprising  great job guys
didnt see that coming at all
tabarcode 
this episode really made me cry i was bullied in school and it breaks my heart when kids do this
cant wait next eps 
tacode next week is going to be another mess for sure
that preview for next week 
i also hate pors whole family
tee is trash
hes the whole landfill
omg i was shipping tabarcode since kinnporsche era and now it finally happened so happy
im totally confused as to how they knew each other ahead of time so did he only get close to jin to get revenge for non or did he really like both of them mind blown
love this shows so much 
i think this series supposed to be tacopper but why it seems like ta and barcode feel kinda disappointed
2j is literally so fine
after seeing these basars im hoping and glad they de horrible det7s
its that jj with his fine self playing the teacher  yummy
i cant believe that boc would put money into this thing their last two productions were high quality this is not the best vehicle for a phenom like barcode what were they thinking
the sad part is this is literally how it is in real life when making friends kids are so mean lol i have to keep reminding myself its just a show its just a show 
i cant only watch a little bit at a time 
i had to do the same i wanted to go through me tv screen and slap the shit out of those 3 bastards when they call him greasy it makes me so angry
yeah i had to take a breather after this episode it was a tad triggering
the sad part is this is literally how it is in real life when making friends kids are so mean lol i have to keep reminding myself its just a show its just a show 
it really took three people to restrain barcode hahaha
i feel bad for non he just wants to make friends and now not only did he tire himself for a script that he didnt even get recognition for he has to pay for a camera that he did not destroy and do it in illegal means because what else can he do
the way im rooting for the masked killer to be non and slowly but surely torture the group mentally before killing them especially top and tee
im going to need white to run away like a track star and its not even from non haunting them its from his shtty boyfriend tee youre better off alone now i feel even more bad for white
see i completely understand why non is haunting them they dont even have to fully explain the backstory anymore i would haunt them too the only decent person is jin the reason to hate non hes introverted wants friends the lack of at least impartial treatment astounds me
well they deserve something that episode was upsetting i hope jin is actually nice and is helping non maybe even one of the new characters and the teacher they had to show the teacher for a reason i swear if he is someone else who hurt non giving him a ride i will be pissed
wowwww why are all the characters in this so shitty its hard to watch but man barcodes acting here is top notch i also see a little copperbarcode chemistry haha this script is really interesting there are so many mysteries 
barcode and coppers chemistry is something i expected because they look good together but i did not expect how much i would be down for this ship hahahaha
i think they have chemistry too copper acts well with barcode and he seems more relaxed i watched a bts episode and i remember being struck by how barcode stared at copper while he was singing and kept looking at him during the episode they must really get along
i noticed the copperbarcode chemistry too i was like wait a minute why is there a little spark here lol but this situation is a little hard to watch for me too theyreexcept jin treating non with the upmost disrespect
por just gives me a really ray vibe
man that is so much worse then what i could have even imagined poor non white is about the only reason i have a shred of hope tee doesnt die now
tee set non up just so he can use him to open a bank acc for his shady uncleln my books he is the worst of evil
i love jin but for some reason he seems so suspicious to me
i only like jin and non the rest are terrible aint no way i wouldve taken that from them i wouldve been fighting
this episode was hard to watch it actually should have a trigger warning for those who struggle with bllying watch with discretion 
truthfully i had to take a few breaks from watching this because they doing way too much to non
haaa thats why u all should die all is fake except jin always got bullies poor non and i miss ta
i have a theory that the person non is texting with the heart emoji is someone in the group and they are helping him get revenge i think maybe tan because we didnt see tan and top get separated after the motorcycle accident so i think tan did something to top just a theory
 tbh i had low hopes for tans survival because imagine smoking with asthma
i also think tan is going to suffocate because theyve mentioned his asthma a couple times chekovs asthma
these bullies are a bunch of losers  they all deserve to die including jin who cant firmly stand up against his idiot friends
really missed tas protective and masculine vibes in the last episode hes the highlight of the show for me
this episode was hard and i felt so bad for non and worst one was top tee and por even if tee is suffering it doesnt excuse his actions i hope jins kindness is just kindness and he doesnt have an ulterior motive behind his actions all in all it remains exciting
im more inclined to believe that jins kindness is fake and that he has an ulterior motive he somehow tolerated his friends crappy treatment of non by not holding his ground and not being firm in condemning their actions
someone save non please 
im ready to jump in the screen and beat everybody ass except jin non did them a favor and they wanna treat him like that im infuriated
omg barcode you are amazing you are incredibly talented i have goosebumps
worst episode so far hope they all die and suffer from craziness
i love how in the beginning of this show we were all rooting for them to survive and now we all are rooting for their downfall
after this episode i hate them all por tee top and fluke can all rot in hell jin was the only decent one so far i want to know what really happened to non hes gotta be dead right if so i hope his ghost gets his revenge and kills them all
who needs enemies when you have a friend group like that geez
finally barcode entered the chat
omg barcode you are amazing you are incredibly talented i have goosebumps
his family life isnt that great the only one who didnt treat him badly was the one who was communicating honestly with him at this point the only ones i dont want dead are white fruiaz mio ta and cooper i dont want no more hurt to come non
i commented twice and didnt know where they went however this is the thai male version of mean girls por and the other treated non like he was a piece of trash taking credit for work they had no hand they were bullying him you can see he has no friends low esteem
i feel that non and jin have feelings for each other
its looking like a possibility that jin is crushing on non but it seems like non isnt quite sure what to think hes little stand offish second guessing jins intentions hard to say but i hope thay realize they like each other and dont let others interfere be brave jin non
am i tweaking or was the answer to that maths question 1 thats been distracting me maybe its a metaphor for 1 person left
i wanna fight this whole friend group for making nons life miserable may por rot in hell
theyre bunch of bulliesthey deserve to be deadkll all them non take you revenge
episode 5 was so traumatizing 
ate as always
i am looking forward to the wrath of non
dang i hope that non gets themohmygod wait is he nons brother
510 anyone know what jin is posting in the live comments
why is barcode so chill
excellent well done to the directors and actors 1010
im on episode 6 and i dont know if i can continue the level of bullying in this has me so upset non just wanted to belong and have friends por tee and want to be famous have me sick to my stomach i dont know if im going to finish this series thank you jin for caring
yeah i was bullied pretty hard as a kid and some of this stuff is really triggering some of the scenes i had to take my headphones off and just read the subtitles because that helped get me handle it im still interested in the show though
not jin watching kinnporsche 1116
barcode literally needs an awardd for how great he played this
tee makes me soo mad
istg this show has so many ups and downs i wanna cry
tee and white are really sweet cant wait for the next episode
ep5    
 ep6 ep   100  17 
poor non i feel so bad for him all he wanted was to have friends and look what they did to him 
that teacher is sooo disgustaaaanggg ew ew he should be put up in jail
jin i beg you pls leave non alonee stop gaslighting him to stay
im rooting for non to unalived everyone except phee tbh
yeah all of them can go to hell
 ep6        
playing non had to be a very exhausting and mentally draining role barcode has done it justice but i can imagine he wouldve needed some mind space to let go of the role after shooting
this show is driving me crazy why non doesnt switch schools and get away from these awful people is beyond me they are not your friends why put up with the bullying its so painful
 ep5      
the way i screamed through most of this episode i was on the edge of my seat this series is so well made and detailed i have so many questions still about how we get from here to the start of the show but thats the beauty of a mystery 
so can someone explain to me that phee and jin is a thing before and based on episode 7 phee is non boyfriend and jin has a feeling to non im confused helppp meeeee 
phee and non was boyfriend first
when is next episode
5 episodes left then i can binge watch because im seeing and reading good things about this series
the ghost ship that started in kp
the series is getting too chaotic and im starting to annoy  less interested to watch
i feel so bad for copper why barcode must have a lot of screen time this 2 latest ep just made me skip a lot just to watch copper
previous episode na stress talaga ako
that teacher is messed up i feel bad for phee he did not deserve to be betrayed like that
another great episode im really enjoying the story line so far especially barcode who is wonderfully portraying the complex role of non yep next saturday couldnt come any sooner
barcode bat ang lantud mo na hahaha napabayaan kaba ni jeff  huhu paganda na ng paganda ang series na to 
since barcode turned 18 hes kissing everybody lol for real though some many people have taken advantage of non that it makes me sad and livid at the same time they destroyed that child and this is a lesson i taught my kids about predators and socalled friends
plot twist
woww this episode had my anxiety rising every minute with a twist after twist i cant wait till the next episode
i dont like it 
can we have series between this two i mean their own series tabarcode
im hoping that jin and white come out of this alive i want white to really see the person hes so in love with the tree branch wasnt enough for por tee needs something bad i just cant think of it now all of them are assholes fluke is just as bad
for real to think i felt bad for por getting hurt i need worst to happen to tee and fluke ridiculous
if non murdered them all i would consider it justifiable homicide
plot twist 
great story 
never thought i would wanna see jj and barcode together but its actually not that bad
what are you doing non
nooo my tacopper ship  kind of disappointed it turn out this way please let pheejin have an happy ending
so cutehope this cp have their own series
do you mean pheenon
the way i am so down bad for pheenon for that single hug the way they were clutching each other was just everything to me 
us makes a great villain or maybe an antihero hope they book him as one again in the future
i miss him as tay in kp
omg omg omggggg  i cant wait for next week what the heck this plot twist is so gooood
omg ta twist i love it i never expected him to be the  guy also i want everyone else to die lol i cant wait to see what happens 
i really hate tes
the more this continues the less and less i like tee top and fluke the amount mess they put non in its like hes their worst enemy
am so confusedso does it mean that non was secretly dating phee and when he unalive phee will join the group for revenge of his dff
i guess so i probably missed something before but i thought the heart non was texting for some time was jin because of their chemistry but it wasnt maybe phee joined the group to found what they did to non and possibly bring them to justice or revenge like you said
ugh my loves togetherim so happy idc
i like tacopper the most they have this chemistry overflowing from the very beginning
im ready to jump through the screen to fight everybody doing my boy wrong
wait whattttttttt
ang ganda ng first few episodes but getting boring na sana naging quick review nlng history move on na sa current event lol
d q pa sya nasimulan panoorin was planning to binge watch after it ends
feeling sad for jin already he doesnt deserve to be played or be used for revenge if he really has nothing to do with nons case
maybe pha and jin are working together
this series is soooo good 
screech wow boc is giving us the ghost ships and the new ships and love triangles im loving it are we going to see barcodes first kiss are we going to get a tabarcode kiss before a barcodejeff one i cant wait a whole week faceplant
jin is on his way to nons home where he might meet phee for the first time however im really concerned about the possibility of phee using jin  please dont the death of two people even for revenge is too cruel
wow didnt see that outcome
this is insaneeeeee whatttt
omg pheenon unexpected  before this i am expecting that white  non had some relation cant wait for the next episode
this series gives me a headache that means its well done  i shouldnt have started it before the last episode was published  i cant wait 
wait phee and non but the teacher though see i knew it was something up with him
 but none of the others have been able to see masked killer at the exact same timeone always sees when the other cant
 i dont think jin is actually helping phee to get revenge he seems clueless as he was screaming when he saw mrkengjin is a good guy for sure but i think phee doesnt know that and have used him to get into the group hope jin remains as good character till the end
exactly especially when jin is like cant you see him over there or cant u hear anything then phee will act like naaa i didnt hear or see anything naga i have been suspicious of that dude since
whatever is this plot twist tacode finally happened 
i think this series supposed to be tacopper but why now it seems like ta and barcode feel kinda disappointed it doesnt look like copper is the main cast
theres still 6 episodes left so we have to wait and see what happens my theory is ta and copper get together to avenge barcode or maybe they met stopped liking barcode and started to like each other instead but copper is definitely main cast this is backstory for later
felt the same way indeed
this is a flashback before jin  pheasant met hes probably getting revenge for his boyfriend
omg then phee is the culprit i think he is getting help from that sir as well poor jin i think he got used by phee for his revenge
phee and non  i didnt see that coming
omg i just realized that they are singing barcodes song from kinnporsche the series its the song he sang for kim
i think one of the boys was watching kp at the lunch table on a tablet too lol
ohhhh its getting spicy
the biggest plot twist ive seen in a while also love that copperjin watched kinnporschehurt people hurt peoplethat seems to be a running theme in this show 
non deserve better 
 
all of the guys are being jerks but top is the only one who seems to be getting genuine joy from watching non be tormented
i just wanted to come on here and say that everybody in this series is a hot ass mess
man baby baracode is killing it in this show im so proud of him
yeah so im gonna gaslight myself into thinking that white is still alive and he get to live a happy ever after with tee
white
i love tan and white together in the end 
ep   
i hate the bully mentality but more so the person who sees it and does nothing they all deserve what they get in the end 1 down 4 to go
oh baracode acting so good at such an young age he has an amazing potential  worth it so good 
if pheenon are not gonna end up together im gonna cry
 
wth  i caught chills 2259 
ep 7               
english subtitles
this plottwist was so insane i dont really think anyone saw this one coming pheenon is so sweet its so heartbreaking to know they are gonna end up together in the end we can see from this that all non ever wanted was love he wasnt loved by his parents not by his friend
i clocked the set up since the beginning but questioned myself cant wait to see what happens
not by his teachers everyone failed him except phee but still in the end he was driveb by rage and said thisr aweful things to him i cant wait to see how this story is going to develop phee has to avenge my precious non
this episode is clearing up almost all the relationshipsits a little shock but i really want to appreciate the acting of all actors which really bring us into this seriesand theres more clues for us to investigate and its funreally cant wait for the day all clues are solve
barcode is a really great actor also the character non is a very sexual character hes acting out of lust because he thinks he can get true love in return from his partner and side pieces
side pieces he let his teacher take advantage of him for money to pay off some sht he didnt even break
i wonder if jeff has seen this episode 
i was thinking the same thing
7     
hmm im ready for the next bully to die teeyour up my man
7      
im so heartbroken poor phee and jin i love pheenon and now im just crying my eyes out 
 mr keng in the worst wdym
por tee top and non is the worst
there are many twists and turns in this episode many things happened in just one short episode it made me feel like i was on a roller coaster while watching it although havent been many stories about flukenbump aired yet but i will always support him playing a baddie555
pheenon is so cuteee and how i was shock about kru keng and non it made dff so interesting and i am so excited for the coming episodes to come to know what happened that resulted the first 4 episodes to happen
will jin end up dead because of phees wrath
those scumbags should be tortured before they die thats the right justice for what they did to non 
such a damn good dark story
plot twist is supposed to be a situation where by we the viewers just the wildest shock cuz of the unexpected character so in my opinion white deserves to be nons brother making him the biggest plot twist of the movie cuz he is the most scariest and innocent among them all
i cant wait to watch the next episode
we need music video or lyric video 
we need officiallyric music video for these ost 
 ep 7         
im terrified to watch this episode lolllhere we gooooo
english subs for the special clips please
now we know now we know
  
preview of ep 9 is really making a lot of sense now maybe phee and tan are there to take revenge on behalf of non maybe theyre there to find information i could be wrong but thats what i think it is so far everything is slowly coming into place now
i have watched this many times since i became a bl fan in 2020 but i still keep coming back  i even read the novel because the series is too short i know its very impossible but im still hoping for season 2
please i couldnt even watch the scene with non and the teacher its so gross ahhhhh
english subtitles please i cry
hias phee and non look so good together tho hiiias
wait why is phee acting like he doesnt know who non is when theyre all at the house in the woods in the very first episode he obviously did since they were dating im going to wait till all episodes are out to finish because this series has me hella confused
probably because hes involved with the killings
maybe he approached the group to avenge non coz he knew what kind of assholes those people are
hes pretending that he doesnt bc i think hes trying to get revenge for how they treated non
why would non decide to write a script for people who call him greasy why would be tee would ever want to help him nons common sense is out of the window the only person i feel bad about is phee he had tears in his eyes and had a gut feeling that non was lying
this is another series that should have a higher ratingive seen some rated this series with 1  and it deserves so much more this is a keep you on the edge of your seat thriller and the actors are doing a great jobbut im biased to talove him 
i wonder if he gets with jin later for revenge
i feel bad for non dont get me wrong but the only person out of all of this so far that i want to surviveget justice is phee he has shown no flaws yeah maybe he was a lil bit of an asshole in the beginning but omg his poor heart i just wanna hug him
well ive just binged watched 7 episodes and this series seems too have me hooked so much happening anyone could be doing the murders  poor non and phee i do hope non is not dead and the others all get what they deserve brilliant storyline and well done to all the actors
lets just hope its not another disappointing end like another series that just ended not getting my hopes up this time would rather wait to be pleasantly surprised than letdown
first off the teacher is disgusting and a pedo tee por and top and white deserve the worst fluke and tin are just as bad bc they see whats happening to non and they do the bare minimum and non did not deserve none of this to happen to him  and phee baby you stronger than me
i hate top the most he makes me wanna crunch my fist into his face but it seems that they are all a bunch of bottom feeders guess this is a great example of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer
white is innocent lol
wait what did white do
there screaming so damm loud 
my babies are all grown up  jsjsjsnsnsnsbsbsbshshsjsjsjsjsjs
that teacher how disgusting to sleep with a student eww and those group of so called friends are truly awful people im glad there slowing getting whats coming to them they deserve every single thing they get jerks 
doesnt non have an older brother named new when is he coming into the picture and phee had every right to be upset his friend zoning jin for the longest now makes a lot more sense cant wait to see what happens next
english subs please 
all the characters are hideous  and yes that includes non my gut feel tells me a terrible part of phees character will also be revealed soon is there even a real protagonist in this series this will definitely have a tragic ending
 they mean hideous as they have hideous personalities not hideous features that also applies with the word ugly theyre ugly on the inside
do you mean you think they are all bad guys or do you think theyre ugly cause what you said doesnt make sense
what do you mean hideous do you mean like they are all bad people or do you think they are ugly cause thats what hideous means
all of them that did him wrong deserve to die
dying isnt justice its beating the rap imprisonment lock them up with real thugs i believe it would honor non best
im thinking it was top and tee who probably uploaded the sex tape and not jinremember top was following non
 agreed 
great twist so jin thinks he did even though he didnt get to clock post before his pc went black and feels bad for involving non into the project this places jin in danger unbeknownst to him non is a cheat tho however his trauma is clear
when i tell yall i loveeeee barcode he snapped as he should have i dont know if yall caught we he told tee the only friends he has is dead non been messed up its something about those quite freaky people
i feel bad for non
plot twist tan is non older brother he has infiltrated the group to take revenge on them theyre all high from non s medication
holy snap this started somewhat awkward and uncertain to captivate my attention i stopped watching but  the boys are doing well and the hell written into this series is fascinating poor non all the crap hes had to manage will keep watching for sure kudos 2 all
so frm what im getting in the teaser for the next ep is barcode is the killeri need a new ep nowwwww
i feel its phee however theres so much going on anyone jin too or a partnership between phee  jin
tbh i hope they get the teacher fired bc thats just made weird and i think barcode acting a little slow not noticing that this is a not as big as a problem it is so like yk but still keeping me interested even thoooooooo
getting better each week
the plot twist burn me out
omg this was a crazy episode i cant believe it and the next episode he will totally loose it for sure  the acting with ta is so good cant wait for the next episode for sure
that tongue is something else
where
now we know who it is and why maybe
i feel so bad for phee so disappointed in jin and so grossed our by the teacher
its getting better and better
phee father so great 
group therapy anyone 
 me too
sign me up
trust me we had the same reaction to phee  non 
damnnnnn 
oh now it time for fun
if i were non yeah they deserve it
oh and phee he should of listened to his boyfriend who loved him for real he didnt and caused pain for everyone around him will phee forgive him should he
he should of listened to his gut and not involve himself with any of them
omg  cant wait for next episode ohhh barcode i love you mannnnnnnn
the plot twist that keeps on giving idk whats gonna happen next anymore 
that escalated quickly this is really good 
barcode is such a good actor
this show is actually really good all the plot twists
right they all grew so quickly
what have you done is the theme of episode 7
oh my gosh it was really shocking i was surprised to know phee and non was couple after everything now i dont know what to feel about non i am heart brokeni am looking forward for the next episode 
oooooooooommmmmmmggggggg this is far from what i imagined barcode aaaaaahhhhhhh but whatever you and tah came all the way to be these great actors well done  great job dff casts
words cannot express how phenomenal this episode was i justim floored im scared for non this whole episode scared hed get hurt scared hed get caught scared hed hurt himself its all bad i feel ao bad for phee at the first pf the episode i changed my mind about jin
friend why would you do that you hadnt confessed to him or anything so why did you put him him out like that jin is a shjtty friend too wow this episode has my emotions on edge
like he enables hia friends he sees theyre shjtty people and yet he still goes along with them and talks non into taking their bs too then the sex tape happened and im like yeahhhhhhh jin in his feelings and exposing him like that like hes his man hes suppose to be your
if this doesnt end in non killing all these btards then i will not be happy  the only one who gets a pass right now is phee i like the acting in this but surprisingly i think 2j is the weak link i dont really believe him as the sleazy teacher
 i feel like white is innocent and i have no idea about tan yet
 i believe one them is non brotherjust cant figure out which one
what about white and tan im wondering what role they play in this series are they innocent or are they part of revenge
for some reason i feel like i saw this before like deja vu i have no idea why though 
on of the best for long  cant wait for each episode 
i realize now that fluke isnt really that bad just the king of minding my own business lol
i have no words
nooooo they made 2j a pervertwith barcode no wonder us is pissed off all kidding aside i dont know what non was thinking he had a way out phee and he screwed it up todays episode was nons fault and i am scared but curious to see what the next episode brings
given how time was flirting with mccaua while he was dancing with tay in kp i think 2j has already been made a pervert agree about the way out and screwing it up
phees dad lawwwd 
yessssss
that man is scrumptious
also i feel really bad for non but homeboy is full of bad decisions the one person you had in your corner you betray in the worst way if you would have just walked away from those aholes and that script the moment they treated you like trash you wouldnt be here
omg
i need it to be next episode likenow i envy those who can binge watch thishey future me this is a reminder to not do this to yourself again
seriously jin instead of helping your friend you get in your feelings that non has no clue about and do that to him the fact that you even recorded it instead of calling the po po is cray cray
or tell the principal i guess
jj is playing a fkn predator say it aint so 
just wow
i feel so bad for phee
oh no non
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i just came here to squeal like a stuck pig
also i want all of the bully crew to get whats coming to them i want white to know the real tee por fluke etc it makes me sad and livid with how they treated non thats why you cant treat people any kind of way now youre going to pay for it
i want white to know the real tee this part white is a sweetheart from what weve seen and he is with that ahole like how much has he really changed remember when him and top almost left everyone until he looked on his phone and remembered he had a man to protect
why did yall erase my comments i feel so bad for non everyone was taking advantage of him in every way possible the teacher and his socalled friends did him wrong i was definitely on the side of jin until he did what he did i dont know what he was thinking
pheenon had so much chemistry that my eyes was sparkling like a why did the teacher have to manipulate non  jin i thought he was good but he let the jealousy blind him im sad because i really like pheenon  jinnon
ta and barcode was a ship i didnt know i needed til now
i never understood why ppl thought jinn was a good friend i always thought something was a little off plus i always noticed non seemed uncomfortable when jinn would touch him
well well well barcode is not the innocent kid anymore na 
let me just live in the first five minutes of the episode 
oh my barcodes acting is insane
holy  i already thought this series was good but omgsh its even waaaaay better than what i thought this is going in all sorts of directions  i love it excellent acting on all parts ps  phees dad and the teacher although ick are hot
oh wow poor non  
oh wow poor non  
omg
what a delightful episode estoy  pero mudisimo con todo lo que esta pasando
im with phee on this one
im soim shocked this whole episode was soooo crazy
well thats a lot to digest
i knew that teacher was suspect i feel bad for phee
i couldnt have prepared myself for the content in this episode i just hope protection was used on non
dffep7 was something else  cant believe we got to see tabarcode kiss before jeffbarcode  not complaining tho our adorable ghost ship sailed too hard 
damnn nons a player bro rlly belongs to the streets lmao jin accidentally uploaded the s3xtapebasically means that hes not innocent as well lol hope it doesnt get worse for himphee went thru so much hope fluke dont turn bad too for the rest of the bois hope yall die
non about to snap and i feel so bad for him 
barcode is such an amazing actor his scenes gives me the chills every time
2j x barcode the unexpected
they shouldve been endgame in kinnporschethey keep mentioning new but they never show him im hoping theyre twins and its a glass onion situation
i cant tell if non is a good or bad person but how dare he cheat on poor phee
im mad that he didnt just tell phee about the debt but i honestly cant blame him for sleeping with that guy for the money to save his own life
i need a season to
this whole series was bananas unlike any other bl you will see i like that they went a very different route for this bl
im speechlessso there have ss2 oooh noooo but i love it finally my pheejin saviour but non and tan feel sad but is look like tan still alive actually i really dont want anyone to die teewhite
every plot twists is driving me crazy
i hate you phee
my heart hurts so bad for non  i can feel the pain  barcode is such a good actor the pain hes tried to potray really get me  not just barcode but all of the actors are such a good and excellent actors  the way they express their emotions are so good 
nons parents are the worst parents in all bls mother is worst than the father but both bad 
 i was not expecting that that was an intense seen for such young actors im impressed with how well they pulled it off
listen phee in his daddy villan avenger era is everything i didnt know i needed however i do think that hes lost the plot as far as jin is concerned and im positive that i dont want to see a redemptive story arc for jin whether an active antagonist or bystander
they ruined his whole family they all deserve it and sorry but even jin
the plot is so awesome love it
ep8 is sooo hot 
it hurts to see jin broke again 
anjeng semua  dahla mati semua gapapaaaa 
who voice at the end  mr keng
the gasp that i gusp
im speechless what a plot my heart broke
taaaaaaaaaa
top tier
holy shit this episode was crazy i knew it was tan and phees plan to befriend the group but i didnt expect them to drg them all making it seem like theyre crazy and hallucinating holy shit that is insane next episode is gonna be even crazier i just know it
english subtitles please
okknowing what i know nowim going to watch the beginning episodes over cause phee punching tee is personal now
fluke doesnt realize that by him doing nothing hes just as guilty as all the rest of them this series is so good and it deserves all the praise its so much more than just a bl
i dont understand why anyone would rate this below 4this series definitely doesnt deserve low ratings marks its a thriller with melodramaone of the best ive seen on herenot to mention great actors and omg ta and cooper barcode and jj are awesome as well
 they definitely are and i believe i just posted mines now tell me when i specifically told someone what they should likeyou must be one of few who rated the show below 4if so like you say your opinion 
we are all entitled to our own opinions just because you like something doesnt mean everyone will
found it hard to get into this series and then found out barcode was in it binge watched 6episodes and this show is crazy good and bad for those struggling with first episodes hang in there it gets better now the long wait begins for the last 4 episodes

all i can say is fluke could be the key to everything here

every time phee dad comes on screen i am like heeeeyyyyy daddy  its my reprieve from all the crazy in this show
not me playing the last part in slow motion to have a peak who called phee after the movie 
same i paused itwhich speaks volumes about my pausing skills i think it was tan
 bl  teen slasherhorror           
ok barcode is slaying this character acting is top tier i absolutely love phee and i cant wait to see which direction he goes with this group like all poor non needed was one decent friend
 8      bully dffsocial issues 
 8     
         
we need behind the scenes too 
i have to give tens where tens are due barcodes acting as non is amazing the way he acted out the degradation of nons mental health is superb
excited for next episode
yes phee in his villain era lets go
           iqiyixdff
whenever fluke claims he has nothing to do with this i cant help but laugh i have many gripes with this group so much i could write an essay but fluke bothers my soul because all it would taken is an one on one conversation with por that it wasnt non who dropped the camera
literally i hate complicit bullies
that that scene and every one with him in it irked my soul like just speak up fluke is the biggest coward in the group 
maybe its his parents and newbut using emojis just seemed like he was trying to keep their identities secret 
i just throwing it out therecould they have secretly been seeing each othercause non never verbally agreed to be in a monogamous relationship with phee and non seems to blindly trust teewhy would he drink from his canteen
i think thats his call logs
does non have 3emoji for contacts i wonder who they are im just throwing it out there but could he had multiple sexual partnersexppheemrkeng and  omg teesometimes tee feelings came across as he cared for non
i think its just his call history so its likely the same contact
i think it can be just his call history so its likely the same contact
im in piecesim drowning in tears 
no i dont think non and tee had a sexual relationship i think he only looked like he cared so he could get non to do what he wants and when non did do what he wanted he treated him like crap again so i doubt they had anything going on
devil works hard but vietnamesse translators work harder
why is there no english subtitles 
no english sub why vietnam
and the revenge plot begins i really love this series its so twisted but are the teacher and non alive we need to know haha i cant wait for next week 
the first couple of episodes was boring and a little confusing at first it got more exciting after episode 6 waiting for episode 9
i just love how everyone has been defending jin so hard and now everyone is like kill them all  its so funny to me
 1  2       
3      4          55555
im only 7 mins in but unless its all a new script being played out it came to mind that maybe its new who will take revenge for non just a 
or his parents
jin is a joke he never left the group to support non
tarn mybe king brother
there is no english subs
phee i can still remember you promise jin will protect him ill be holding on to your promise and hopefully this is not just for a revenge
english subtitles please for the dff special clips
how come the special clips of dff do not have english subtitles 
i dont understand its tacopper that won the hidden character but theyre most likely not the highlight in this series i am so confused
its the story line dear
its starting now im half certain tan is non brotherstill dont know what roll white playsmaybe he is truly the only innocent one
the uncle has on the tutorteacher watch
every episode is meticulous about what this director wanted to show to the audience each episode made me so emotional in a good way this episode brought out the vengeful btch in me phee and new please destroy them alleven jin i miss non he needs cuddles
this is my opion i like it so far i love barcodes character non i think non shouldnt have cheated on phee and i think that the teacher shouldnt have slept with his student i dont like him also i think that jin should only showed phee the video non desevre have his revange
non had to be a mentally and emotionally and exhausting role to play it was exhausting watching him be used and abused every episode kydos to barvode for playing such a difficult role i bet there were times he just needed to step away from non to preserve his mental health
after watching the firsts episodes i thought they where good kids but now omg they deserve it all of them they are horrible  so exited for the next episodes
 8          
         
   1           
           
yasss phee is getting revenge for non im here for it so now i know for sure that mrkeng is dead its most likely that non is dead too i hope he is not but we have to wait im so ready for the next episode phee  tan have to be smart with their next move
so tee knew why non disappeared the entire time  phee getting revenge for non and is tan maybe new nons brother  ughhh they gave me guessing 
right i guesss tan is newnon bros
im very excited to see white come into play hopefully we get to see him in the next ep
nobody is answering his calls
tan has to be new nons brother i think that new was the person we caught a glimpse of at the end i think he  phee teamed up to get revenge for non  2 killers this series is so damn good
ls keng an undercover cop or reporter
be careful who you call friends they made non disappear and went abound daily life like nothing happened
about
everybody pissed me off in this episode
4    barcode   
nons villain arc had me alil scared
we know keng is dead but non is most likely dead too i feel so bad for him but phee has to be the one getting revenge and im here for it
omg his acting is great him going all crazy and wanting to hurt them as much hurt as hes feeling i wonder what happened after and i also wonder whats next is non still alive 
poor white hes going to be disappointed with tee and looks like phee and new is killing them for non
looks like pher and tan are together and watching at first non used to have a brother new maybe tan it new non brother
bish these group of friends better all end up dead my anger issues cannot  poor non
oh nooo pee is holding grudge for non most likely he is not serious with jin
phee ta  tan mio better get the revenge for non 
        
i am so here for phee getting reve6 who is tan exactly
we think hes the brother
probably new nons brotherbig dragon sound
upon rewatching this im still on the absolute incredulous notion that phee would ever forgive jin but then to date jin after so nons dead and jin just skips off into the sunset with his man i havent been this grateful for a cliffhanger in a long while bravisimo
omggggggg so good
the ending like its not done yet i dont likes the ending 
i dropped this series after episode 2 but im so glad ive made it this far this is a hidden gem
jyybk
wait what are we getting a season 2 how you just gunna end it like that
i dont know what to think or who to blame anymore this is crazily amazing  and why do i have the feeling that white is connected to non cant wait to see the next episode everyone is impressive  good job
i really like it when newtan plans revenge his heartache must be repaid for everything he experienced they must also experience it
all i can say is they are all good ive seen ta us and barcode from kinnporsche and they excel in here they grab the opportunity just perfectly and top character forgot the actors name  i saw him in some cutie cutie role and he delivered his roles so darn good
want to see all of them again in other seriesdramasroles this series is just interesting actors and people at bts everyone are so good a 100000000xxx 
this show has me completely confused
they are reacting just like audience who doesnt know what will happen
they might be young but their acting is so good especially non
wooah tan new is the real master mind why is phee telling everything to jin is he reliable idk i wish them good luck my pheenon heart 
new being that manipulative
i am so invested in this series tannew cracked after his parents passed who wouldnt after what they did phee lost only non tan lost his whole family its hard for me to see phee feel even a little sympathy for jin but i get it phee acts like a playboy but he falls in love
im thinking fluke leaked the video
short episode this time 
what a masterpiece 
this going crazy right now 
no frkn way i knew from the start that white was a part of nons revenge holy crap bro
i think this is the shortest episode wth
when is ep 10 coming out
they are competitive
im excited about the plot twist for white
im so excited for tomorrow cant wait to see whats gonna happen in the present time all the chemistry is on point they are absolutely delivering entertainment in these episodes credits to the writers actors directors editors camera crew stylists etc love them
i think the actors are doing a great job also in my opinion ta and copper are amazing together
i think jin is a really good character he literally went against his friends to defend non every time they bashed or attacked him until non did mr kang even after that when non freaks out and attacks them with a knife jin is the one that stands up and says sorry and is t
and that he is the most to blame i dont get why hes getting so much hate he shouldnt have filmed that but he realized that and tried to correct it people may not like that he still stayed friends with the group but there is a lot we dont know
 i dont want to dislocated your shoulders this phee is a high pitch pervert 
 seriously  very funny i tell you
i laughed at that dialogue i was like who says that its new  but the dialogue was fun though
 you didnt study dumbass i swear this tan new was a whole mood during the class exam
the only reason why my heart breaks for jin is because he fell for two guys but they did not feel the same way but the heart wants what it wants phee is softhearted when he loves he loves with his whole heart he fell for jin you can see it but jin was part of the asshole
group jin and the rest of those assholes are part of where non is right now they destroyed him from the inside out and deserved everything coming to them how far do i want them to go i didnt want them dead but at least jail time with their lives destroy i want them to live
wwwwoooooooowwwwoow
i hope nothing happens to white as he was never involved with anything that happened
phee is the only one who has kept it together in all this
aww man we dont get to see how white and tee met thats what im most curious about because white is way too innocent but its ok its probably not super relevant to the plot this show has been great i really like everyones acting 
crazy theory what if white is related to the teacher who disappeared with non  like they are brothers or relatives
   
also i am ghost shipping bible and max so hard for no reason they had next to no interactions but they would be really good in a show together
 no i think there mixing ta and bible cause they played in the same show together
 same question why talking about bible here when he have nothing to do in this show
bible is in this show 
they were right about bump though as sad as i was to see max go in dff bump really does have something special that draws the attention i think fluke is the one who is secretly the worst of all of them i think he uploaded the video of non and the tutor and he sees everything
i love bibles voice when he speaks english i know its his first language but his voice is so pleasant and perths accent is so nice too
tan new completely lost his mind and seemed to have no control of the situation he has lost everything jin is such a coward but i hope nothing bad happened to him i think phee likes him but what they been doing for the 2 years this episode was a rollercoaster
how many times did you watch that nc scene me yes
this series is stressing me tf out after this episode all i can ask is whats real and whats just a hallucination is por actually dead or are they hallucinating also i do not like phee and jin together ta and copper have zero chemistry i hope they dont stay paired
their chemistry is really good seems like they might be a new bl couple not sure if they will get their own bl soon or initially start with side characters in another bl series like kimche in kinn porsche
why do you think they dont have chemistry just wonder
what you talking about  ta and copper have an real good chemistry together you need to watch them again closely
l think without intending to do so phee fell in love with jineverything will come crashing down when he realize that its jin who filmed non  mr keng plus l think if tan tries to harm jim him and phee will have a fallout
i left at 3 and now im glad i came back for 9daaaaaaaaaaaaam
if phee ends up with jin i will be speechless i dont like jin
hes only using jin to find out what happened to non
listen i dont like jin
wait till the endafter that hate if you wantwho know the real plot twist
everyone thinks newtan is so great he lied and took his parents money for two years without having any contact with them and yes i knowhis parents arent getting any awards for being parents of the year
i was not prepared for the slap 
i dont know how i feel about pheejin i wonder if non was still alive who would phee choose
just imagine non comes back after 3 years of a happy life abroad with mr keng only to find he has no family left no house and even his former lover has been killed or injured by his brother and new is either in jail or has committed suicide
how does that make sense mrkeng got hit by the gangs car and died
i lost my mind in that nc scene wtf  also i know non had it so hard but i pity new so much he had to learn about the disappearance of his brother stop school and witness the death of his parents thats too much for him  i hope nons still alive tho idk what to feel
about phee actually falling for jin i shipped these two when i saw them in ep one but knowing the bs non had to go through i dont think they can have phee end up with jin at the end
i feel sorry to non he got use of this bunch of user especially tee he deserve to die in this series i dont have any sympathy to them except for white ta and tan they deserve what is happened to them isnt enough actually coz look what happened to non family
2936 phee i dont have any clothes jin [you wont need them anyway] 
so far except the clear issues my biggest problem with jin is his naivety i dont if it was on purpose regarding that but trying to convince non that it would get better when the movie group clearly hates him is peak blindness tbh as soon as non wrote the script cont
 thats very true but personally i couldnt stand the person i liked being treated like that the correct decision for jin shouldve been telling non to distance himself from the group with him and non hanging out together by themselves
i dont think it was naivety i think he knew they wouldnt stop but he liked non and wanted to be near him
their tune shouldve changed although it wouldve been fake but its better than nothing i just wish non wouldve taken phees advice to get away from them or switch schools i held hope for jin but knowing his friends i shouldnt have been surprised that my hopes were dashed
also at this point you cant help but sympathize with nu yes he was a little too selfinvolved to be the best sibling but he loved his brother clearly and for the fallout of his disappearance to wipe out his entire family kill everybody
phee in his daddy villain avenger era is giving me all that i didnt know i needed however i do think hes lost the plot as far as jin is concerned and i dont think jin deserves a redemption story arc even if he was just a bystander he complied with all the bs
 they have outdone themselves with this series
well oh my damn this series is freaking incredible im so invested its crazy top it off with the explicit scene that i was not expecting and whoa
ngl my pheenon heart hurt seeing pheejin together but i did rewatch for scientific purposes lmao ta is so dvmn fine bro all i need in my life right now is a phee lol now that we know that tannew is the instigator lets see how far phee is willing to go
i totally agree with you as an adult straight european woman i find tas masculine vibe incredibly appealing i never imagined that id find myself fantasizing about a thai bl actor
im sure phee caught feelings im not a jin fan but it is what it is i hope phee learns the truth about the video though i want tan and phee to make it and i want white safe and learn how much his boyfriend aint shjt tee essentially destroyed a whole family
i feel so bad for newtan
i want to see non again i dont care about phee anymore nobody deserve to get bullied like that non i hope ur not dead 
this series is so good that every episode released makes me crave for more phom chob sees jin being in love also i hope its not just for revenge phi coz im holding on to your promise with jin that he is safe with you
 that night when jin saw non with khru keng he was upset and was crying all night this is the reason why i think jin had feelings for non and saw him with another guy phee and saw him with khru keng i think it was also accidentally when the video he took was posted
im also a bit confusedis it me thinking that jin develo feelings for non that time but back up coz he saw non with someone and that phee i think also he never recognized that that was phee since they left i think he never saw phee face that night
incredible
punish them  punish them all  they deserve it 
this is a thrilling series but i am not thrilled i always sad huhuhuhu every episode is freakin sad can we have at least one happy episode huhgughu
jin saw phew and non together  how come him doesnt recognize him
that was what i thought too but meybe it was too dark and jin didnt recognize phee
he did not see his face
jin doesnt see phee face thats why
i think he only saw them from behind
from behind dst see the face
showing the cheeks is crazyy 
god damn that nc scene but as expected from the makers of kinnporsche
i know right
wow this episode was a roller coaster of emotions
phee is getting seriously distracted i hope he and tan can still get revenge for non in the end
new tan best brother
are we not getting english subs for this episode we got them for the 8th episode
i had to go into subtitles to chose english
another great episode 9 the suspense is killing me  i cant wait to see how the story will unfold particularly tees and whites
me too
yooo this episode is crazzyyy my eyes couldnt keep them open or closed
kuddos to all the actors next ep gonna be interesting asf
also my heart aches for tannew poor man going through so much
i know there will be pheejin saucy scene but still i did nawt expect it to be this explicit it caught me off guard ngl
erghhh im stresing out
omg i love this series its so good
how are there no comments yet did that nc scene leave everyone too stunned
guilty as charged  i was not ready for the nc scene and it was sooo hard not to scream  ngl after the nc scene i had to stop for a moment and was like omggg
yes shocked 
grabeeeeee  
grabe talaga kawawa naman si new
i think phee really did start to fall for jin because they are both kind of similar and he might have reminded him of non thats a reason why new told him just dont fall in love with him
 you are victim blaming you can see what that boy was going through and he was groomed by hes teacher dont forget he was 17 are you telling me you could do better if you were in his position is your moral compass working
the cheek of newtan to question phee on if he cheated on his brother when they all know non cheated with the teacher first was a bit harsh boys heart was broken by your brother and he is still willing to take regenge on his behalf
i agree with you  plus i think he did really like the intimacy cause he went for seconds the next day and he was kind of sweet about it i think that the level of chemistry is out of this world
ayoooo vegass look at your lil broo 
macau grew up 
hed be so proud 3
new and nons parents are villian 2
finally
did anyone else gasp at that phee and jin nc scene  
love this show so far
