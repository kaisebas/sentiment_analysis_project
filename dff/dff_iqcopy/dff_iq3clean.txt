why is nons nicknameenglish translated sticky bug in this version while in the actual episodes its greasy
its actually wild that most of these guys are in this show because they won an acting competition
just like kinnporsche the shock factor is amazing the amount of twists in the show are crazy there is so much unexpected stuff that happends this is now in my top 10 bls boc definitely makes great shows that was proven yet again
love pheejin
im waiting on english subtitles too 
      
where is the english sub
phi ta ur are the mysterious guy ur are mr are planning tale revenge for barcode or u are the one cause barcode death
this iss soo gooddd canttt wait to watchh the next epsss
the fact that they left without caring anyone else one has a boyfriend and the other has best friends apparently i understand they are scared but i you so called care for the others then actually help 
still good so far tho
people really need to watch this series each episode has me on the edge of my seat i am sad por died but the coming episodes are flashbacks so whoohoo
im kinda feel sad for white dude is innocent and confused af but also got yelled the most
fluke creeps me out can he be the next to ho bye bye
nong fuaiz being the damsel in distress
i started watching for barcodewhen will he get more screen time but now im watching for tacopper as well also fluke needs to chill hes scary
ive stopped watching this series the acting is not good and the story line is to far fetched was looking forward to this series but was disappointed in it after kinnporche series being so good was expecting better but hey other ppl may enjoy just not me 
what the duck happened 3 years ago tell us already
fluke is honestly more scary then the mask man
i cant believe my mans is still laying up on this couch with a tree in his gut homie should be dead by now 
what the hell is this 
this is good huhuhu the ghost is also cute im so whipped in ghost
so cute 
waiting at the edge of my seat to find out who is the masked killer  big scaredy cat here but enjoying how its going 
is it just me or does anyone else feel like tan has an ulterior motive like maybe hes there to find out what happened to non specifically or maybe hes helping him
im enjoying this but i think they all still have a lot of learning to do so far the only naturalish actors are ta fuaiz mo  us fuaiz is pretty good in this episode  if ta could loosen up a bit hed appear more natural but hes still good
i loving this episode but the ghost on the motorcycle was just hilarious
im sorry but the scene at 1526 its the funniest thing ive ever seen it had me dying laughing the way masked killer threw the ax 
i feel like one of the boys is in on it with the killer but i may be wrong
i feel this way too
acting is a littlehmmmmm many weird plot holes coming from the same company that made kinnporsche i had high hopes but i will keep going cus im still intrigued not many horror y series out there at all
rewatched the first episode i noticed fluke was looking rly rly suspicious hmm
someone in that group is the killer right right
i think in the end its just going to be all an act they improved on their past mistakes this time around we shall see
but it doesnt match with the timing unless there re 2 masked man one is outsider or on  one from the group
i felt bad for white poor baby was just there scared for his life i give pros him bc i couldnt act a scene where theres a gun pointed at me and get scream at i would have a straight panic attack
my brain cant conclude a theory in this series its so good that i suspect everyone is invovle lkasdfjksaf
lmao i dont wanna sound rude but they acting is kinda terrible or is it just me
im havent figured anything out yet could be anybody
we are only on episode 3 episode 3 how am i going to make it to 12 the anxiety this is good stuff
oh how i love bl series that have a bigger idea for a plot than just a love story  like ones that have boys love in it while not being the central idea of the plot aka horror bl or bl with special abilities in it
 which could it be where the cast is all full of babes and the plot keeps thickening keeping us on our toes enjoying the new genres 
white could not have girlbossed any harder 
why do i sort feelsomebody is actually reshooting the same movie they did earlier
brosame
i am loving this
lots of blood and scary stuff 
this show is so fun and good
this keeps impressing me this cast is great 
its not kind to leave us hanging like this i dont think i can wait a week for the new episode this show is incredible
what if its not barcode non cant wait to actually see him in the next ep
if they actually show us
