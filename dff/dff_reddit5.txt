There's SO much more depth here than some people are picking up on, imo. None of the characters are really being presented as purely innocent or bad, I think, and I believe that the ones who seem one or the other are going to develop more depth as we go along.

Por - is a spoiled rich baby but also seems desperate for the approval of his parents or at least of his father. His father also seems to be abusive from the clip we saw of next week.

Tee - I have to go back to pay closer attention to the dialogue, but it seems like his father is possibly sick? He's beholden to his uncle who is using him for his own benefit by getting him involved in the money laundering. We know that his uncle ends up in legal trouble later on, what happened?

Fluke - doesn't seem to be directly involved but keeps getting dragged into his friend's messes. This happens in the earlier eps, too - he hasn't done anything but he keeps getting affected and we can see the mental toll it's taken.

Top - he's actually one of the characters we know the least about and I'm curious to learn more. He's obviously very self serving, though, and willing to let Non take the fall for him.

I'm curious about some dynamics, here.

Tee and Non - well, actually, Non and all of them except Jin. Why do they dislike him so much? It seemed to go beyond just bullying. I wonder if Non did something in the past (had a breakdown or something) and that's why they have this dislike of him?

Keng and Non - Non did NOT look comfortable when the teacher offered him the ride. Is he the heart emoji in Non's phone?? What happened to Keng, since he seems to have ended up dead?

New - who is he? The obvious link that seems to be staring us in the face is Phee/Phi and Non/Nong but is that the case?

Tan and White - how do they play into this, particularly Tan? White is Tee's partner but is he as innocent as he seems or is there more than meets the eye? Why has Tan been asking so many questions?

Tee and White - how did the two of them connect and fall in love? The two of them actually fascinate me!

Perth (the actor) - when/how will he get involved?

And lastly Phee and Jin. What's Phee's history? How did he and Jin end up together? What's Jin's story beneath him protecting Non, etc? How did he become friends with the others or is it just a matter of not realizing what they were like? The difference in his character is obvious in the flashback, he's become much harder, unhappier imo.

SO MANY QUESTIONS, I'm loving it. I can't wait until next week!

You are so on point with your analysis !

This mixed with what we had in the trailer really make me wonder, specifically for TeeWhite. It seems like White pursued Tee more than the contrary. Also they are part of the « university » crew for which, again only in trailers and sneak peek, with Phee Jin White Tee and Por. The tangle is deep!

Honestly after analysis of other trailers White can’t be that much of a clueless boy. For me that’s more Tan.

White is seen fighting with Jin in a trailer (I think it is him). He is part of the university team to which stuff seems to happen (whether they are just acting for Jin or something truly happens is yet to be seen, but there is like a whole preview on that specific period). I also think I saw him being traumatised in one scene. And there is this whole entanglement with Tee, which is more than just a passing romance. They have a lot of scenes together.

There is also this strange scene where Jin is filming himself in a mirror and the picture glitches and White suddenly appears next to him !

I don’t know what to do of this but that does not scream “innocent final boy that will simply make it through”

I’m inclined to agree. The general reaction to White makes him come across as an audience surrogate channeling “last survivor in a horror movie” vibes. However, one of the fundamentals of the horror genre is that everything is not as it seems at first glance. Friendly faces might be enemies and monsters could have been the victims of tragic circumstances. So I wouldn’t be surprised if he turns out to be not as innocent as initially portrayed.

Imo none of them are innocent (maybe with the exception of Non at the start). They all hide something, and have all or will all do something nefarious. It seems like the serie is good like that.

They will all have reasons and circumstances. Ok maybe some will just be nefarious, but I don’t believe any of them to be pure good. I am really looking forward to knowing more !!

Isn’t it obvious that Tee is hiding things from him? White doesn’t fully know his partner. It’s probably going to be devastating for him when he finds out the truth.

Which trailer are you watching? there seems to be one that may be unrelated or just 'thematic' to the show, that's the shorter one that BOC released first. It doesn't seem to fit at all with what we've seen so far in the show.

Ok, the Jury is out: TEE SUCKS AND HE DOESN'T DESERVE WHITE. Like I get that everyone has their issues that make them do what they do but in the present, Tee doesn't seem to be repentant, just regretful. I really REALLY hate Top. Liars and people that can't accept their wrongdoings just make my blood boil. On the other hand I can see where Por is coming from, maybe because I know he just died in the present. Now, how did Fluke get involved in all this mess???

One thing for sure, I can't blame the guys for not knowing the answer to the Calculus problem. That teacher??? He would make me stupid for sure.

Barcode is killing it as Non though. He's giving innocent but in the brink of losing his mind really well. If this ends up being paranormal, I can't blame him for going off from the afterlife. # TeamNon TBH.

Maybe he has all this pressure on him to get good grades and get into a good school maybe scholarships. Sometimes parents, especially East Asian parents will put all this pressure on you and even more so when are from a poor family (lucky if they don't have a restaurant or business because then you will be pulling double duty with working for them and heavy school load) because a good education to good job can take you out of poverty (at least that's the goal and the ideal).

Also IDK if New is favoured over Non because momma was all about sending New money. Is New at University? Can't work a job? Like she was going to get an emergency loan like I hope it wasn't a loan from a loan shark because girl that's gonna kill ya.

You are right! Plus do we know what country he is in? Is he in USA, London, Singapore, Australia? Because if he was say in USA/Australia/London then even his part-time wages assuming he has scholarship to school/work study or under the table is more than what he would make in Thailand. Unless he's just partying it up and getting money from parents...Guess we will see...They better tell us and show us LOL

Except that Top broke the camera and panicked about being able to pay Por back. It seems like a lot fewer steps for Tee to be like “don’t worry, I can help you out” vs going through the motions of setting up my sweet lil sweet face Non.

I know it’s because he is friends with Top and doesn’t care about/actively bullies Non but still. Seems like a lot of extra hassle

Oh god, I loved and hated this episode with passion.

What these mother****ers did to Ton is beyond hideous, I'm so glad they're all going to die horribly.

Por is dead and I think Top too because Fluke was beyond crazy when he shot, so two less motherf***ers. Tee is going to fall soon because everyone blames him for what he did to Ton.


It's clear who is the guilty party here, Non's lover and New (Non's intelligent brother).

If you ask me, those two are Phee and White (don't know who is who).

I don't think White is so innocent as he seems, he is very intelligent so I believe him able to infiltrate the group becoming Tee's lover and the same with Phee with Jin.

I don't know if Jin is guilty too. He is the only one who was Non's friend so I don't know if he is just a victim whom they hid what happened to Non or was the one who stabbed Non at the worst moment.

The next episode was going to be painful and probably where these a**holes take Non to the vacation house and kill him, so grab the tissues and brace yourselves.

Oooh I like the theory that White is the ex and Phee is the brother and they teamed up to get revenge. It would make sense that they’d target Tee, who is clearly getting Non caught up in something illegal, and Jin, who was closest to Non. Maybe the hot/suss teacher was doing something unsavory to Non and became their first victim.

Ngl- my Macau/Chay ghostshipping heart was hoping Barcode and Ta would make out at some point but I’m willing to sacrifice that for a vengeful brother murder spree.

You managed to put into words my feelings.

In the clips, White going for Tee seems… purposeful. Like he really went for it. And it would make sense if it was for long game revenge.

Also fun note but Fuaiz had to say an aggressive line in some of the extra games and he was like “I never played a bad guy” and everyone howled and laughed. I don’t know what to make of it 😂

Also would go with the white being sad clip, the white fighting Jin, and white appearing from nowhere.

And Phee being the big bro would make sense, but may also be a red herring. Salmon know how to play with us 🥲

Finally found out some of the backstory and this group of friends are bullies as expected.  I don’t know why Jin and Fluke are friends with them maybe peer pressure or to save themselves from being bullied too. But they share some of the blame for whatever happened to Non.  

 The tutor seems sketchy too and I think may have done something to Non as well.

I love the plot.... Kudos to the writers.... Wow..... ❤this ep was so good.... And barcode woah from porchay to non with his entrance he nailed his role and this ep was interesting and unique.... Screw those frnds especially tee and that top guy so selfish... And what's with those drugs tho that Non intakes something is fishy🤔direction is lit... And acting is fine👍to certain extent.... Love the plot❤and also the actors... And JJ looks so different i couldn't recognize him here with his dyed hair/teacher role... 👍

I guess it's revenge either by that tutor (jj) or maybe his Brother New(to whom their parents send money to in abroad)... Idk but i love the story.... And what they do to Non is just so worse🤡and I'm excited how his ghost/maybe drugged murderers will take his revenge.... 👍

I guess Jin's crush is one sided and he later did some nasty shit to non in the end... And that ❤guy is a mystery (is he the tutor idk)

So, someone from the Phee/Tan/White triumvirate is totally a plant. They are either the brother or the heart emoji on Non's phone (or there are two plants and they are working together for revenge)

The fact that Mr. Keng is dead... he was there for a reason.

Jin seems so nice here, but there is definitely more going on with him. He goes from being kind to the school outcast to what we see in the present. Tee's a bastard, but I'm fascinated with him. He's not WHOLLY bad, as we see with him needing money to help his father, and in the present, he is willing to run back into danger for White (and Top being Top it seems since the very beginning just wanted to run and save his own ass)

Por is totally one of those dudes that tries to start either game streaming or podcasting and gets all the expensive cameras and microphones and equipment first before he even knows if he's going to be successful. Like... your iPhone would have done the job just fine, ESPECIALLY with a found footage movie. Bitch, you want the grain!

Barcode is killing it with this role. Though, I would have maybe given him a make-under because they call him Greasy and he's got gorgeous shiny hair and is one of the prettiest boys in school...

This show is so fucking good. SO FUCKING GOOD. Even though nothing scary happened, you could feel the rising tension that we were on a collission course with disaster.

Someone (maybe on tumblr) analysed that greasy may be linked to poverty instead of simple appearance !

It’s like “dirt poor” and the notion that poor people are dirty. Which also explains why they wipe their hands after touching him.

But agreed, Barcode is truly beautiful and a pure delight to watch acting.

We could do a horror trope bingo with this series, they are throwing everything at the wall. Finally Barcode makes his entrance and we are getting the backstory, looks like we’ll take a couple episodes to get the full story, but there is a lot of episodes to go.

Flowers to Jet he plays the asshole character really well, he’s absolutely insufferable in this episode.

I an sus about the tutor… get the feeling we’ll be seeing more of him soon, and who is Non’s parents sending money too? What happened to Non that he’s on meds? So many questions, as the plot thickens.

No timestamps this week as no sexy time and no scares. But TW for bullying.

Quick question.  Has the show established the ages of these characters. Are they all the same age, or just the same class at uni? But White is def. the youngest right? 

 The show heavily hints that New is like an older brother to Non, but I don’t think they explicitly state that New is actually an older brother.   My first thought was that New/❤️ are one in the same, but the ❤️ emoji is a red herring to make you think that this is a separate person who has a romance with Non.  Except the actual texts are misleading too because they’re not romantic in nature.  Just I miss you’s. Are you at school? Are you free to talk? Very generalized.   

But we all know there’s no way the new trio (White/Tan/Phee) came into the friend group by chance. At least one (or all three maybe?) is pulling the strings and manipulating things BTS in a big way.  I would LOVE if they’re all in this for revenge, because they all had some specific relationship to Non, either by blood, friendship, or romantic entanglement.

Oh, the theory about ❤️ being New is nice, I like! We see that ❤️ is very caring (asks if he took the meds, asks if he arrived safely (I think 😅), but not available when Non called them multiple times. And the I miss you could also be something between siblings, since we know that New is abroad.

Maybe I misunderstood, but who of them 3 is related to Non by blood? 😅

But my friend and I had similar theories about at least Phee and Tan serving reasons to believe in this theory!

The show hasn’t established that anybody is related to Non by blood yet.  I’m just theorizing at this point.  But I wouldn’t be surprised if it is Phee, which I would love.  Possible scenes between the younger brothers of KP? Count me in.  

Also, correct me if I’m wrong but don’t Phee/Nong translate into older brother/younger brother in Thai?  But this could be a mislead though 🤷‍♀️.

Yeah, I wrote that I could have misunderstood you. 😂 English isn't my first language so it's hard for me to always understand everything in the way it was meant and that's why I ask. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Sorry if this bothered you. I didn't watch KP, so I don't even know who the younger brothers are. 😅 I only know Ta is playing the younger brother of Vegas, I think. But I don't know who's brother Barcode is? 😅

I don't think they would choose these names without any meaning. 😂

Just saw this , no worries at all, I figured it was a misunderstanding 😛.

The more I think about Phee being New, the less likely I think it’ll happen though. It’s way too obvious with the big brother/little brother translation, and the timeline probably doesn’t add up.

But I do want some kind of connection between Non and Phee to be revealed though. I just want a scene with them ❤️❤️.

You should watch KP, it’s ridiculous and fun at the same time. But Ta played Macau, who’s the younger brother to Vegas and Barcode played Porschay who is Porsche’s younger brother.

....Porschay and Porsche. Thai and their names. 😂😂😂😂😂

I have so much on my cw list, I need to finish something else first. 😂 But KP is definitely on my "plan to watch soon" list.

Barcode casting is really spot on, he is born for this kind of character. I just can't wait to witness his duality. I usually despise bullying plots it just pissed me to the hell. They do really make a good bullies, i hate them.

Soo everyone except Jin is a bully and a piece of shit. That makes it so much easier for me to watch them get killed off

I hope before Tee gets killed White finds out what an absolute ass he is. Points if it’s White that kills him 😉

Same. I need Tas character, Jin, Barcodes character, and White to ride off into the sunset while everyone else gets stuck at the murder cabin forever.

See, he’s the one I feel like we’re all sleeping on. Do we know anything about him other than he’s Phee’s friend? I was thinking maybe he could be New and/or ❤️.  He just comes off as collateral damage, and the character that has to ask all the questions so the viewers  can find out more info.  He’s the most sus to me, at least right now, of the trio White/Phee/Tan.

I have a (maybe) crazy theory:

What if Jin is behind the mask ghost attacks? He seems to be genuine with Non (at least from what we have seen). It’s clearly a group effort (more than 1 ghost) and prioritizing the ******** who bullied Non and are involved in Non's disappearance. That will also make sense since he wants to leave everything behind after this trip and go abroad. Also, maybe the ones with him are the New (non brother) and the one Non was texting (heat emoji).

I can’t wait to see what will happen.

I don't think it's Jin, because he gets attacked too and he hears these crazy voices, that Phee didn't hear (Episode 1, balcony scene). Only Top heard them too, as far as I remember. So.. the attack wouldn't be a reason to negotiate the theory, but the voices. Wouldn't make sense to only act as if he would hear something, if Phee doesn't hear them too. And he sees Mr. Keng and hears voices again, but Phee sees and hears nothing.

I see your point. And I agree, and I assume Jin is not totally innocent in the end (maybe something that involves the tutor).

I really like the theory that many people are involved for revenge and have a mole inside the group. There is so much going on, and I really want answers and a lot of twists!!

Not crazy, that would actually fit in horror trope wise, for the unhinged character out for vengeance.

I had so many thoughts about this episode, it's insane. My friend threw the guess in, that she would love a twist. That ❤️ is actually one of the boys in the house, who helps Non to get revenge. I think, it could be. She named Tan for example and oh boy.. now I see 23930 things that would totally fit in this theory. (What also fits to it: Phee was the one who assumed to watch a movie, searched through the stuff, suggested to make a remake, insisted in..etc also White randomly encouraging Tee in this, wanting to see them making the remake, although they didn't see a lot of the movie yet, so why are you so down bad for this, lmao. They saw nothing much interesting to be so excited for a remake. But that's probably nothing. 😂 Only us getting lost in theories.)

I assumed ❤️ was Perth in the beginning, since we don't know him yet. The teacher is also sketchy, but he didn't know him when he got the message, so.. but obviously something happened to the teacher. 🤔 Wonder if Non was involved in this (what happened to the teacher, I mean). Oh, I hope that's nothing connected to abuse/SA or something like this. Like someone mentioned, Non looked so uncomfortable with the teacher alone. (In the classroom, he looked pretty okay, almost proud? 😅) I mean, the teacher looked okay and nice, but hey..it's always the nice guys. 😭 But back to the ❤️. It would totally make sense if it would someone we already know, because there is no name, but they give us immediately a message from Jin, to show it's NOT Jin, what many people probably assumed, because Jin is so nice to Non.

So far Tan and Phee are the only ones, who never saw the killer alone. Only when they were with others (or I oversaw something.. my memory is bad, so I wouldn't be surprised) Fluke didn't see him too, but I guess that's because he's always with Por. And he got strangled, lol.

The moment we saw Non taking meds, i screamed "WHAT IF THEY GET DRUGGED AND SEE/HEAR THINGS BECAUSE OF THIS?" 😂😂 and of course the question; for what does he take them? It's a lot of stuff he's taking.

I think we definitely see, that Phee, White and Tan are less involved in things happening to them, than the boys who knew Non. So far White, Tan and Phee also didn't hear the mysterious voices that Jin and Top heard in the first episode.

I also wonder how Phee and Tan join the group in the beginning and how Tee and White met.

Fluke looks so fucked up all the time. 😂 He's so passive and quiet, only wants to become a doctor, but everyone around him fucks up and drags him into it. This guy seems mentally absolutely not okay. 😂 I hate him a bit, because he's so harsh to my crybaby White, but I also understand him..kinda.. he's confusing af (as he should be, I know). He looks very observant, but not obvious there to see for others. (Like in the scene with the broken camera. 😂) and it doesn't make any sense for him to stay there longer and destroy the walkie-talkie, if it would be for his career, because things are only getting worse if they stay longer and don't get out of this freaking cabin. I am so curious about his character. Why he's always so annoyed and fucked up, why he is friends with them (well, that also counts for White, Tan, Jin and Phee. This group seems so off. Why do they even spend time together?! Phee and Tee also have this tension all the time, that they are fed up with eo) what is his role here? (Expect of a sophomore med student and a detective conan viewer 🫶🏻😂)

I am definitely looking forward to next week's episode, although I find the flashback a little bit too draggy sometimes. I just love how interesting the story is. It leaves so much room for theories, although it starts with a cliché plot. A group of friends, a cabin in the wood, a bully victim disappeared.. and yet it's not predictable what really happened. SO GOOD! Considering that it's the second (?) show from this company, rookie actors and we all know that BLs doesn't have a huge budget, this show is really great so far.

Edit: another thing that leaves me confused: The bathroom scene with White in the beginning of the show. Where his skin had those bubbles on it. He doesn't really look concerned about this and he doesn't really care about them just (dis)appearing. 😅

Jokes on you, I'm into that.
Everyone is analyzing the clues we've gotten and my ass is over here, "OMFG THAT'S NAME'S ROOM! WHY WOULD THEY REUSE NAME'S HOUSE FOR YET ANOTHER CHARACTER THAT GETS OVERLOOKED/TREATED BADLY BY "FRIENDS"?!" BOC, you're some sick people. I highly doubt it was planned.
