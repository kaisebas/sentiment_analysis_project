Upon re-watching this, I'm STILL on the absolute incredulous notion that Phee would ever forgive Jin. But, then to date Jin after? 🥴So Non's dead, and Jin just skips off into the sunset with his man?! I haven't been this grateful for a cliffhanger in a long while🫡. Bravisimo!

I am so invested in this series. Tan/New cracked after his parents passed. Who wouldn't after what they did. Phee lost only Non. Tan lost his whole family. It's hard for me to see Phee feel even a little sympathy for Jin but I get it. Phee acts like a playboy but he falls in love

The only reason why my heart breaks for Jin is because he fell for two guys but they did not feel the same way. But the heart wants what it wants. Phee is softhearted. When he loves, he loves with his whole heart. He fell for Jin. You can see it. But Jin was part of the asshole

Tan/ New completely lost his mind and seemed to have no control of the situation. He has lost everything. Jin is such a coward but i hope nothing bad happened to him. I think Phee likes him but what they been doing for the 2 years? This episode was a rollercoaster.

So far except the clear issues, my biggest problem with Jin is his naivety. I don’t if it was on purpose regarding that but, trying to convince Non that it would get better when the movie group clearly hates him, is peak blindness. Tbh, as soon as Non wrote the script CONT.⬇️

Replying to User7ebc6875f: That’s very true but personally I couldn’t stand the person I liked being treated like that. The correct decision for Jin should’ve been telling Non to distance himself from the group with him and Non hanging out together by themselves.

their tune should’ve changed. Although it would’ve been fake but it’s better than nothing. I just wish Non would’ve taken Phee’s advice to get away from them or switch schools. I held hope for Jin but knowing his friends I shouldn’t have been surprised that my hopes were dashed.

Also, at this point, you can't help but sympathize with Nu. Yes, he was a little too self-involved to be the best sibling, but he loved his brother clearly. And for the fallout of his disappearance to wipe out his entire family?! KILL EVERYBODY!!

Phee, in his "daddy, villain, avenger" era, is giving me all that I didn't know I needed. However, I do think he's "lost the plot" as far as Jin is concerned, and I don't think Jin deserves a redemption story arc. Even if he was just a bystander, he complied with all the BS!

Replying to Irish Mc Vea: That night when Jin saw Non with Khru Keng he was upset and was crying all night, this is the reason why I think Jin had feelings for Non and saw him with another guy (Phee) and saw him with Khru Keng. I think it was also accidentally when the video he took was posted.
