More tragic than I thought it would be. Was ready for a slasher with some revenge. Was not ready to be haunted by Non's story and keep thinking of it days later.

Frankly, the ending was fitting. They all deserved to die with the exception of White and Non. Non was a victim of atrocious behavior. The rest, trying to escape responsibility. Tan is the example of the depths humanity can get to when pushed to the extremes of human viscousness.

Reflecting on Ta and Copper, it's nice to see them grow and the pairing work out. I'd love to see them play adults in a different storyline. I feel like they grew as people during the HTC and filming process, which can be seen in the interviews so far (I'm still watching).

I feel like with all the conflicts, this series could have been longer. It would be interesting to see a season 2, maybe with the other THC people who didn't make this one, and barcode because he stole this show. I was happy to see Perth and hope to see him in other projects.

unsure if this is cultural, and given the genre, I may have used a wrong word, but...teachers have a lot of power over students. a minor saying yes isn't the same as an adult saying yes. i understood as it was presented but couldn't forgive the character.

Really terrible, what a terrible ending. Even though I have been a fan of this director's work for over 15 years and his work used to be very interesting. Of course, most of his work is a bad ending and he always talks about Somewhat Loliness and I see it in this story.

Logic would dictate that it's New. Who else knows about the antidote other than New and Phee? Also, as I said before, Jin is the ABSOLUTE WORST. The fact that Phee is so accepting of what he did irks me, and it doesn't seem true to his character, Jin's redemption arc is trash.

The series is better in everything, except the ending. That's the problem with horror/suspense storyline, sometimes you just dont know how to end it so you'll leave it hanging, open-ended. Jin doesnt deserve to get out there alive (or not). Non and Tee's acting are 👍🏽👍🏽

I swear if barcode doesn't win any awards for his acting in this I will sue they all did an amazing jib but Code went all out you can see his hard work and dedication in this series

It can not end like this! We have to get more I can’t accept the possibility of the three biggest traitors and liars possibly making it out alive

I had to finish it. But I don’t like it. I am guessing they are all dead and they still say what happened to non as to how he died. Or tee is the only one that survived. Either way. I didn’t like this one.
