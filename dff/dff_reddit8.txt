Oh man, I just had a terrible thought - when a gangster says "I had them work off their debt" and they are pretty and young? I really hope that Uncle Joe didn't sell Non off into sex trafficking...

Amazing acting by Barcode in this ep! When his dad slapped him i felt it in my bones. However, EP7 remains my most fav ep thus far bc of how much emotional turmoil it brought.

My thoughts for EP8:

Jin have NOT redeemed himself imo this ep. A bunch of ‚Äústop calling Non greasy!‚Äù or feeling guilty about the leaked video isn‚Äôt enough to absolve him. you know your friends is shit, but just let Tee and Top carry Non away and lied to the police?? if you have enough guilt and seen the person you love so distraught you‚Äôll care for him till the end.

I know everyone is happy Mr. Keng is (implied to be) hit by the car and died. but imo, it was too quick and not enough. he dies thinking himself ‚Äúa hero‚Äù - a good guy who try to solve crime and helped a poor boy. he deserves worse.

I think the red-shirt guy at the cinema is White, not Tan. Reason: (1) Tan was immediately shown in the preview. So why cut him-off to create suspense. (2) The exposed forehead haircut is closer to White‚Äôs style than Tan. (3) In the bts photos when White was in school uniform his pants are blue (same as Phee‚Äôs school).

Side note: Por is shit but the person who deserves torture and death the most is Tee. Por did a lot of mental bullying but Tee is downright criminal. i know he‚Äôs powerless under his uncle‚Äôs instruction, but choosing Non as his victim was all on him.

True!!! i know i said i wish him the worst of torture and death but he‚Äôs honestly my fav character out of the 5 bullies. Whereas Por, Top and Fluke feels a bit 2D, Tee is interesting bc for all of the bullying that he did we get to see the other side of it (the pushing factor). The writing for Tee is great bc he did unforgivable villainy stuffs while still gaining some sympathy points from audience, compared to like Top for example who‚Äôs just shown to be mean for the sake of being mean.

Man these people are such fucking pieces of shit. Even how Fluke is just like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù Like, bitch you still just stood back and let everything happen. Same with Jin. Like‚Ä¶ sure, getting them to say Non‚Äôs name just erases everything. I do like how the group is seeing that they are just as expendable to Por as Non was.

Tee, you are in way over your head. What, did you think that your evil gangster uncle was just going to send Non out to the teenage boy farm so he could live happy and free range with all the other poor young kids?

Barcode acted the FUCK out of his descent. You could FEEL how he was just pushed to his breaking point like a physical weight on your chest.

Man, I started tearing up at the PheeNon flashback. Goddammit. Especially it cutting off at Phee telling Non to just get lost and die.

So, Jin seeing Keng‚Äôs ghost doesn‚Äôt bode well for Non. Ten and Phee not being able to see the ghost stuff makes sense if they were working together. But where does White fit into this???? He was seeing himself with boils all over him, which has nothing to do with anything else. And how does the cult really fit into it? Did Non curse them as he died?

I NEED it to be Saturday again. I‚Äôm so fucking obsessed with this show

EDIT: Right now, Jin and Tee are my fave characters. They have done garbage things but there are a lot of layers there.

I thought they killed him when he went a bit psycho and them going to the police and acting like because of the sex tape they didn't want him around them while filming the movie. I was later confused when Tee was acting brand new with uncle about status of Teacher and Non. So I had to rewind LOL

Let's put our societal hats on for a sec: none of them have probably done anything that really warrants it. Jin has defended Non multiple times and in this episode we can clearly see that Tee doesn't want Non to die. Even by 'horror rules' I find it difficult to clearly label many of them, with the exception of maybe Top and Por.

OMG. Those first 10 min were hard to watch and then we got to the snap and boy, Barcode is nailing every aspect of this frenzy. Color me surprised Tee gave the uncle Non's money. The AUDACITY of this gang!!! I hate Tee with a vengeance and I hope White is gonna kick his ass in the future if Non doesn't get to him first. Tee's words Non is with Mr. Keng, he must be happy??? When he knows he gave Non to his uncle??? It's ominous vecause we knoe Keng is dead so no good oitcome for Non. And that's on Tee. The way they all lied to the Police about Non... üò§üò§üò§üò§ THE WAY POR TOOK CREDIT FOR THE SCRIPT?????????

But nothing hurt as much as those flashbacks with Phee... üò≠üò≠üò≠ I knew his last words to Non would come back to haunt him. Ooh... Tan is on Phee's side. Maybe White will be too. How many more eps do we have left??? I can't wait for next Saturday!!!!

I assume that the file details encoded will show Non's name if that's what his computer settings were and assuming he used a word program or whatever program on his computer, would have those details. Of course that's in our world IRL, IDK if the writer of the series is using DFF world building details and our IRL programs encoding stuff doesn't exist in DFF world. LOL

Have you guys clocked that Non took a picture of the apple he shared with Phee and has it on his desk ? And also kept the flowers Phee gifted him ? If anyone ever truly doubted it they were both so in love üò≠üò≠

The effort put into keeping all these characters multidimensional. And the actors really deliver. Even the pieces of shit have their moments of humanity. Like‚Ä¶ damn‚Ä¶ no weak link in that group.

The rhythm of the episode is perfect. Not too quick, never boring. It is really impressive. I will be able to rewatch it all without cherry picking.

And I had barely recovered from PheeNon and they give us the flashback WITH NEW FOOTAGE ü´†ü´†.

I have so many theories. Are multiple will conflicting ? Like is a severely damaged by the Mafia Non trying to get revenge while Tan and Phee are still investigating his disappearance? Will he see Phee with the fucker group as one more betrayal ? It is even Non? (I actually hope so I want him back). Did he see Phee and Jin and is out for them because of their bond ?

What I would like to see :

Tee sacrificing himself for White. Yes please. I want him human to the end and it would be so fitting.

Non to be back and shenanigans with Phee and Jin. Whichever they are and whichever couple ends up happy. If there even is a happy couple. Maybe he kills them all for real!

I didn‚Äôt clock that. Was it when he was rewriting the script? I‚Äôm loving these small details. This really is a good series that more people need to jump on board with.

To your end point:

Maybe Phee has to kill Non? Im just sayin!!! Im just sayin!!! (I need my ‚ù§Ô∏è to survive this mess.)

What a hard watch this episode was! Por is crazy for not stop filming when Top was getting stabbed by Non. Just shows how he'd do anything to get his film done. He's so slimy

Tee, such a complex and interesting character. Like, I love to hate you . He is a victim in his own way, but imo he is worse than Por. Pretending not to know what his uncle is capable of to try to lesson his guilt. I can't imagine when White finds out the truth.

Jin , i can't hate him because of his beautiful face ughh but doing nothing is just as bad as doing something .

Now i wonder , Phee clearly approached Jin so he could get into the group, but did he end up catching feelings for him? As we see him protecting Jin in the present

Well you see we have opposite feelings for Tee and Jin. Also it would have been so easy to make Tee just a bad guy but‚Ä¶ he really worries about what happened to Non, asks multiple persons and probably harrows guilt about that. Yes he did not care about him even hated him, yes he used him in the scheme, but at the end of it death is never what he wished on purpose boy.

I don‚Äôt hate him but he is complex. I neither stan him nor think he is the worst. But that‚Äôs the good thing : they are all greyscale, and some are muddier than others.

A lot of people are using black and white. They choose a viewpoint (mainly Non but sometimes also Phee) and judge every other character according to that. That‚Äôs how Non gets hate for cheating on Phee, and Phee for not being empathetic with Non, or Jin for taking the video. But there is so much more to all of them

I‚Äôll admit I was harsh with Jin in my review post. I definitely don‚Äôt hate Jin, it‚Äôs just that his lack of action/courage when it was needed is what hurts the most. Because Jin is the closest to Non in the group.

It‚Äôs like when Non lied to Phee about the kiss with the teacher. It hurts the most, bc Phee is the closest to Non. period.

On the bright side, I think Jin will redeem himself in some way by the end, and the Phee/Jin to come softens the blow, at least for me cause I‚Äôm looking forward to the complexity it presents. I could definitely see them finding a comfort and solace in each other, but they just don‚Äôt know their grieving over the same thing. Phee doesn‚Äôt know that Jin was the closest to Non, but he‚Äôll come to learn maybe.

I think a lot of people see him as farcical. He wants to hold up his righteousness but hasn‚Äôt done anything to actively help Non or even stop the bullying. He pulled Non back into the vicious cycle when he was ready to leave this group behind. I don‚Äôt hate him per say, but I honestly don‚Äôt think he is much different from his friend group.

A lot of people probably see that duplicity as more malicious too, because even Non gives him the benefit of doubt and thinks Jin is on his side. But is he really? Does he actually care beyond his own self interest of having a crush on this guy? Again, like all the characters he is complex.

Barcode gutted me this episode yet again, really selling the misery and then the descent. These flashback eps have been brutal just watching all these men preying on Non in every way, emotionally, monetarily, sexually etc. There was an analysis I read too that stuck with me - "everyone romantically/sexually interested in Non thinks they‚Äôre going to be the one to save him (and gets annoyed when they‚Äôre not)" - and I love how it all come to a head this ep. Really hope he's still alive!

Found it wild that the netizen comments that Non read mirror some of the irl discussions about Non/Keng I've seen online so that was especially heartbreaking to see reflected in Non's breakdown like that. Amazing foresight from the writers and goes to show how nuanced they've purposely been making these toxic interpersonal relationships.

idk how I'm ever supposed to forgive Jin tbh lol I really hope Phee destroys him at this point. Even his last minute defense of Non to the friends pissed me off, it just feels so hollow when we also know he continues to be these peoples friends in college and lie for them. plus the revenge porn filming was just cruel! Love Jin's character so much and I'm glad he's there, his role is so so interesting but I do hope he dies hahaha.

now Tee...... logically I know he should die too I know I know but he has hot tall meow meow privilege in my head so I'm still rooting for a satisfying redemption somehow some way idk he's probably gonna die and deserve it lmao but I'll miss his handsome face. Also his actor is definitely the strongest imo of the newcomers.

another great episode, it's so engaging and I am absolutely loving this series.

I'm glad I stuck with the series long enough for it to get to the Non backstory, I was not into the first episodes because I'm a horror fan so the horror/slasher stuff was not giving, I'll be honest. But both the boys from KP are hard carrying for me. Barcode impressed me so much. Ta is giving me exactly what I need from him, also very impressed.The backstory with all the evil stuff they did to him has been very good, hard to watch because of how horrible what happened is but that section hooked me. I just hope that the return to the slasher revenge stuff holds up because it was not very good at the beginning but I'm invested in the plot now so that will definitely help. Just no more slow, menacing walk ups while the boys scream and stumble awkwardly. If they can make the revenge attacks feel tense and fast, it could redeem the whole first part for me.

What an episode. I have never watched a horror that I'm left rooting for the masked killers before. Who is Tan, brother maybe? Is Non alive? Would they really kill off the tragic protagonist? Was the film a hint at Jin being the one to survive? But then what did White do? Is he in on it? Every week I'm left with more questions but each episode is getting soooo good.

I'm a certified fan of barcode now... Wow.... He was a kid crying and a loving brother in kinnporsche.... But him as non ...his expressions when he was going crazy.... Wow... He's so freaking talented.... I really like his character‚ù§in the series... He's the life to the series.. I said what i said... ü§°wow... Pond really did a great job recruiting him... I'm impressed üëçhis micro expressions were not awkward... I can feel his emotions... He knows the correct angles and what makes him stand out... Like i didn't feel anything off with his acting... And Jj too is nailing it... Jj us and barcode are my favs here... Like they really can act‚ù§(i was so into kp ü§°once so maybe I'm biased i guessüòÇ) i also like others too

Tacopper... Fluke(glasses guy)... Tee top and tan are good too ..wicked gang is perfect üëç.. I also don't know who Tan is like i thought he was non's brother but he's abroad nd a college student so ... Idk....unless he dropped out bcoz of lack of funds or wants revenge on his frnds bcoz their family fell apart...i can't think of anyone else who was close to Non....And I also like Phee(ta) like he got cheated still he seeks justice for Non ( like he got morals)...I'm also sick of Jin acting so pure (i guess someone else uploaded the video bcoz laptop turned off and he was drunk etc.. Bcoz pheejin are like leads so they'll detoxify Jin i guessüòÇ)... Still I'd only give Fluke the pass (he was bystander and selfish tho but atleast he did not hurt Non directly)

I can't wait to see what's yet to unfold .. I really love this series... They really spiced up the show a lot...

Also special mentionü§° non's parents fighting was so realistic(I've been there lolüòÇüòÇ) like i felt Non's pain...and barcode really impressed me in that scene..

Best episode yet! I was hooked from start to finish! This show has gotten sooo good!!

Non - There‚Äôs nothing else I can say about Barcode, he‚Äôs everything ‚ù§Ô∏è. I cheered when he got a piece of Top with the knife. But where the fuck is he?!? I don‚Äôt care about Keng.

Phee - LFG, sir, LFG!!! Get to the bottom of it and make ‚Äòem all pay üò°üò° Him slow clapping in the theater? I loved it. I think he was eyeing Jin specifically, so he‚Äôs found his way in I think, soooo here we go‚Ä¶

(The quick recap of the üíîof episode 7 and the last 10mins really confirmed for me that I need a TaBarcode series of their own, something about Barcode‚Äôs explosiveness and Ta‚Äôs quiet subtlety that would be amazing, I wonder how‚Äôd they do at comedy?)

The Shitheads - I ‚ù§Ô∏èto hate these assholes!! Tee‚Äôs still my favorite (I really like JJ‚Äôs face üòç)cause of his storyline, he‚Äôs complex with his uncle, who is the key to Non‚Äôs whereabouts. Fluke‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe effects team. Me, me, and me!‚Äù line had me giggle. Por is trash, and I‚Äôm here for it cause I love Us (who doesn‚Äôt)!!! Top I can take/leave probably, he‚Äôs my least favorite.

Jin -üñï oh how far you‚Äôve fallen üò≠üòî, I was rooting for you! You really are spineless, and it‚Äôs gonna eat you alive. At this point, I hope Phee is playing you in the present, and he‚Äôs the better actor, and he doesn‚Äôt even act

Edit I don‚Äôt hate Jin, he clearly cares for Non. I‚Äôm just disappointed, which is always worse üòÜüòÜ But I‚Äôve got a feeling he‚Äôll redeem himself, so ü§ûüèª

Finally, Tan!!! But is he the brother? 99.9% sure he is but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. But please don‚Äôt tell me White is just an innocent bystander in all this and just hooks up with Tee? I really want my Tan/Phee/White scheming/revenge trio!

But now that I think about it? I‚Äôm ok with him just being the innocent bystander, he was just there for a good time!!!

Hi there Perth üëã

The way my jaw was on the floor for 98% of this episode‚Ä¶ mom and dad fighting really got to me. So many adults failed Non at so many levels and it‚Äôs shown a lot this time. And Jin not admitting his own faults? Out loud? And Fluke saying he‚Äôs not part of it? The fuck?

Also, I have a question and I‚Äôm on mobile and spoiler tags haven‚Äôt been working for me so SPOILER OF A QUESTION: was that Tan in the theater? I tried pausing and couldn‚Äôt tell. I‚Äôm assuming yes because of the teaser but idk. And we saw Perth maybe he becomes a bigger player as time goes?

It looks like Mio, so yeah I would say it is Tan. But I have been looking through the crowd for that red shirt and found it nowhere so they were not seating together with Phee (who is clearly seen on a lot of scenes in the theatre).

Update friend : IQIYI posted on Xitter asking and pinging Fuaiz and Mio if they knew who is that person. The eyes don‚Äôt look like Fuaiz IMO so it has to be Mio. What is interesting is that he was not here with Phee but randomly, so who is he really and what was he doing there

We've all been waiting for it and here we are, Non coming unglued....honestly I think they could have leaned into it harder, flowers to Barcode though he is doing the absolute most in this series.

Plot heavy episode, no warnings/time stamps are needed.

They teased Non writing about the deaths, but I'm thinking it's a red herring, and as the preview is implying Phi is out for revenge/ uncovering the truth.

Love that everyone has ulterior motives and trash people.

So I was thinking, what if Phee is playing the long game here, he's intentionally trying to lure Jin in because he found out what he did and is waiting for his chance to get revenge.

I think Non being the killer is too obvious, what if it's Non's brother helping Phee?

This all conjecture is based on the aggressive amount of horror I watch.

I'm trying to think like Sammon here. I don't think this is gonna end up being a ghost story. I've assumed New was older than Non. Do we have confirmation of that or it's just something we all thought because he didn't live with his parents? What if New is younger than Non and as you say he's helping Phee? What if New is White????

I am starting to think we have three forces here that are NOT working together and will collide :

Phee and Tan, which are best friends and Tan has been recruited by Phee to help him find what happened to his precious lover

White who is New, the brother, I can‚Äôt see him knowing Phee (I mean we don‚Äôt see any kind of attempt at communication between New and Non right ? Even at his bottom ?) or worse Tan. Or he knows Phee from what he found in Non‚Äôs desk, but can‚Äôt be sure of his implications. Also appeared out of thin air after parents decide to invest money into looking for Non. If New is White, he is tech savvy and can find everything he needs in Non‚Äôs computer to trace troubles back either to Phee or to Por‚Äôs group.

Finally Non, because AS LONG AS I DON‚ÄôT HAVE A BODY I WILL BELIEVE, out there with his crutch trying to get revenge for himself. Has he been helped by ‚ÄúPerth‚Äù? Or simply paid his debt after three years? Will he be disfigured? I even wondered if they have like‚Ä¶ sewn together his lips so that he never talks? Or has he been freed when uncle went to prison but was unrecognisable?

I am pretty sure they DON‚ÄôT work together, which explains the messiness.

I also wonder if Perth will have a bigger role to play where Non is involved. He‚Äôs acting as Joe‚Äôs masseuse when we see him, but he could also be doing more. Sex trafficking and slavery is totally a thing with gangsters, so if Non is ‚Äòpaying off his debt‚Äô, they could run into each other?

But Phee and Jin were spared when they hid in the coffin. Maybe that wasn't luck but intentional. If Pgee doesn't know that Jin was the one posting the vid, he would try to spare him. Top taking the spear off seems to me like he got drugged. Or maybe he is just salty about Por's behavior during the premiere of the movie. He was always saying he was pretty convincing as his character and everyone was dismissing him. Now, who killed the uncle? Top? So he could get the setting he wanted fir his own revenge??

I don‚Äôt know if Phee and Jin were willingly spared, knowing that people analysed that it was probably NOT Top under the mask because the clothes do not match (except if it‚Äôs a production blunder but for the moment I would like to think it unlikely).

So who is under the mask ? Tan, Phee and Jin and every other boy apart from Top are accounted for at that point. But masked man had black shoes and Top has white shoes. So Non ?!

And then wouldn‚Äôt it be an artefact of Non NOT wanting to kill Phee, he let go of Jin and Phee and goes for Tee instead. But why Tan ? Maybe he does not recognise him‚Ä¶ or take him for Por‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt know.

Top clearly look out of his mind, be it drugged or just so frayed at the edges that he looses it. Specifically his overall attack, seemingly seizure, and his denouncing of Tee‚Äôs actions.

Was the uncle a mistake ? Or a fake? Or just something we are sorely lacking context for? For me Non can be crazed enough to just kill because it is useful. Uncle Dent had to die as the one who brings food and drives the car. Maybe‚Ä¶

I am so lost but trying to find what makes sense, and nothing properly connects. Which is perfect because I both don‚Äôt want to be able to plan what is going to happen but I don‚Äôt want them to subvert expectations at all cost, like some other occidental show did which destroyed their coherency.

Barcode's performance is so, so good that these 4 episodes have been literally a torture for me. Non is gone and after how those motherf***** killed Keng, he probably had the same fate.

Por proves he has no soul in his body, even recording when Non attacked Top for real, but glad the others felt like Non were they realized they were just expendable like Non was.

I don't feel any pity for Non's parents, they are probably the main reason Non ended with a very low self esteem, everyday compating with his perfect brother, and then the stupid father slapping him, my blood boiled. So now you CRY? Well, f**k you, if you had supported your son maybe he should have ended in that mess.

Tee may be the most evil gay I've ever seen in a series LOL. He got rid of Non selling him to his uncle and the he ask if he is fine? Sure, boy, a potential witness will be okay after being with a mob boss. F**king hypocrite It seems that White will just a bystander but I would have loved if he is in Phee's plan to make him fall.

Jin, oh god, Jin what have you done? You mess it big time, you hindered an investigation and Non's ghost will be following you for these 3 years. You still defend Non but when you had to do, just just covered for them. I'm so intrigued of how his relationship with Phee will develop and why in the present timeline Phee and Tan are sympathetic to Jin. Maybe they know something about Jin, we don't.

Phee and his eyes filled with regret for Non and hate against the group are evrything. Tan and him are going to make their lives a living hell. By the way can we say an is Non's brother, New? He has been very smart in the present episodes and his and Top disappearing and Top coming back crazy is probably his doing.

By the way, in the present timeline that sleazy Tee's uncle is dead. Considering this series, I doubt this is just a coincidence. Who do you think he kills him? Phee, Tan, maybe Non's parents?

Another great episode! I was so indifferent about this show up til ep 4 and now it consumes my thoughts every Saturday morning. BOC can't keep getting away with these addicting shows!!

They gave us more PheeNon flashback crumbs and I ATE. THEM. UP. Non having his mental breakdown and going between sad cry/excitement/crazy cry/back to sad cry was heart breaking but wow kudos to Barcode for acting through all those emotions in one scene.

Keng being hit by a car is the most stereotypical Asian drama way to off someone lol. Seems like he's officially dead then? Though now I wonder why they're being vague about Non ü§î

Por is absolutely a piece of shit for using footage of the stabbing and taking credit for Non's work but damn Us looked SO good during the premiere!! Thank you stylists üôèüèª

and look I'm still not thrilled by Jin in this episode. I realize tensions were high during the stabbing scene but it's just so vague to admit to you were the one who hurt Non the most and apologize but not tell him why? And when he's being interviewed he lies about Non being missing? Idk man maybe he'll do something really big to redeem himself but as of this episode he's not my favorite. Copper was really glowing and handsome in his scenes though.

I'm sooooo ready to see Phee and Tan infiltrate the group next episode and get the gears moving for whatever they end up plotting. Or if they plot at all ‚Äî it could be that their only motivation for joining the group was to find out what happened to Non rather than get revenge, and therefore what ends up happening at the cabin is all due to actual ghosts/cult activity rather than a murder plot orchestrated by Phee/Tan/Non.

Phee ~ I love you so much (and your dad is a dilf üòÖ) IM SO EXCITED FOR NEXT WEEK! Tan asking all the right questions straight off the bat, we love to see it! Revenge begins now.

I just need clarification on the timeline.

The stuff with Non happens 3 years ago? 5 years ago? And then when do they jump forward to? Like when do Tan/Phee join the group? It just seems like months later‚Ä¶.

And then how long is it before we jump to the present time in the woods?

Am I they only person that noticed that non changed the whole script to make it more violent and gruesome for all the boy but jin survived! I think that non made jin survive put of everyone because hes the only one he couldnt imagine killing. I wonder if that point will come up later in the series when we get back to the present day. I also wonder if jin was the one who posted the tape what would happen if non(maybe ghost non) found out about that.

I'm 50/50 on whether this show is going to have an amazingly compelling, rich and intriguing ending, or whether it's going to be rather stock horror, lol. With what they've given us so far I'm hoping desperately for the former but also steeling myself for the latter.

First thing I want to get off my chest: I remain an ardent and adamant Jin defender. It's funny because at the beginning I was kind of like eh, he comes across as kind of bratty, I don't know what I think about him. But as time has gone on and we've found out more - oh, I really adore this character and the depth they've given him.

Some of the fandom debate going on about his character is actually quite frustrating because I feel like it's so black and white and ignores some of the things staring us in the face. Jin is the only one we see defending Non over and over again, INCLUDING in situations where there is no benefit to him. He defends Non even when Non is not around (nullifying the 'to make him look good to Non' argument) and catches flack for it from them (nullifying the 'he wants to look good to his friends' argument).

Is he perfect? Of course not. He's an incredibly flawed character who has acted selfishly and made mistakes, but imo he's the most redeemable of them all. Even when Non is gone and Jin has no idea what's happened to him and he's seen that his friends are capable of drugging someone! Yes, he lies to the police - lots of people do when they're scared shitless, especially when they know that there are four other people who will say that they're the ones lying.

Which leads me into the ongoing debate raging in the fandom as to whether or not this is a story of pure revenge or something more, and I stand by what I've thought since the end of Ep 6 - I'm going to be SO disappointed if this turns out to be a stock cliche revenge horror story. Revenge is like, one of the most basic horror tropes and while it can be very satisfying, to me it would not be the satisfying or compelling ending here.

Instead I'd like to see the show lean into the parallels that I can see here: Jin and Phee both wanted to help Non and failed. Both of them hurt him (I'm not debating which one hurt him more lol) and likely carry a lot of guilt over it. That makes for some incredible potential if the two of them can find solace and comfort in each other. Also, imagine Phee got close to Jin to find out information or maybe even with some revenge or justice in mind and then started catching feelings? Imagine the guilt and conflict that would make come up in him? What about Jin when/if he realizes who Phee is?

The potential is there in SWATHES and if the writers ignore it to go 'lol revenge' I'm going to be so, so disappointed. I also feel like there's a lot in the narrative pointing towards it not being the case, but that's another matter.

Questions:

we saw more of Perth, but does he have more significance!

who was talking to Keng and what happened to their investigation?

are Non and Keng still alive?

I partially agree with you, I can understand Jin, he wants to help but he doesn't know how. He's in love and feels betrayed, a conflict between heart and brain. However, one thing bothers me, I trust that it wasn't him who leaked the video, but the fact that he thought of filming it really bothered me. 

I also want to see the relationship between Phee and Jin, but if the series is to end like their movie (with only one survivor), I hope Phee will be the survivor and I hope Jin will learn the whole truth about PheeNon before he dies (if they decide to kill him). 

For the questions, I hope Non is dead, it would be better for the series but on the other hand I hope he and Keng are alive for full revenge.  Keng was talking to the woman who was spying on the restaurant, we've seen her in an episode before

I‚Äôm with you on Jin. He has done EXTREMELY shitty things and some of the care for Non has been performative, but not all. His feelings are genuine. He‚Äôs flawed, but that‚Äôs what makes him a good character. It‚Äôs the same way I love (and want to strangle) Tee. His uncle was right in that he‚Äôs a coward, but to me, there is more, like Jin has MORE. Whereas characters like Por and Top are just rotten. Top is absolutely a hired goon that sees himself as the main character and Por is a rich piece of shit who will stomp over anyone who gets in his way of what he wants. And Fluke is totally spineless and thinks if he turns his head nothing happened.

With three weeks late and without having seen more than ep 8, there is something that does not seem curious, how is it possible for Jin to see a bloody Keng if no one knows his whereabouts? Since that scene I have thought that Jin was involved in Keng's death, could he have been the one who ran him over in a fit of jealousy?

I understand your point I'd view. I love that Jin is a complex character. However, for me his betrayal runs deeper than any one else. Its very difficult to forgive Jin because his actuon had direct effect on Nons life and for me he did all the bad things in disguise of being a good guy and loving Non.

When I say 'stock horror', what I mean is a stock trope that's used quite often in horror and as a motive.

'Character has a secret connection to the victim in the past and is now here to kill everyone for revenge' is pretty standard for horror. Slashers in particular often have this as a motivation for the killer.

There's also the fact that from the very instant Phee appeared on screen with Non, the entire fandom exploded with 'omg Phee is here for revenge to kill them all' - another reason it's a stock concept. It's predictable and there's nothing particularly surprising about it.

Now, can the surrounding storyline still be interesting and compelling? Sure. But I won't find it nearly as fascinating as if they buck those fandom expectations, surprise us and present something else entirely to resolve the plot.

Before this episode, I still had hope Jin would still survive ‚Äòtill the end but now I fully believe he‚Äôll get killed.

Even though he‚Äôs remorseful, I think he‚Äôs too far gone with the bully group to not be killed alongside them. None of those 5 will survive.

That leaves Phee, Tan, and White. If they will follow the slasher trope with only one surviving, final girl will definitely be Phee while the other two will be casualties from the chaos.

I have two running theories for white:

He's "new" (non's brother) and comes back from abroad to investigate because his parents can't afford a lawyer. He then finds Tan and Phee and works with them on the investigation, and during it meets Tee and either falls for him or takes advantage.

(VERY FAR FETCHED) He's dating Tan, and decides to help with their investigation by getting with Tee.

umm either way I think white is affiliated in some way with Phee and Tan because they were really close at the house and I think being super close with ur friend's young boyfriend is kinda weird?? IDK

This series is just so damn good!!! - I'll be honest, I wasn't sure about it after watching the teasers but decided to follow along weekly and its just getting better and better. Usually I can work out a few things that might happen. But up until this point, I had no idea what was gonna happen. The twist with Phee and the tutor with Non COMPLETELY surprised me.

Barcode! What a development hes made!!! Watching the first few minutes was heartbreaking but he completely sold it, I see where Phee and Tan are coming into it from the teaser next week. I wonder how White comes into the friendship group?

What are your thoughts?

Considering they already revealed to us that Tan transferred to the school with Phee, do we think it could be White calling out to Phee in the movie theatre? I couldn‚Äôt see their face clearly, so it would be a fun twist if White was in on it too!!!
