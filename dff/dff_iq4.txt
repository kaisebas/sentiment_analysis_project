I am only on episode 4, and this is already too hard to watch. I don't know if I can continue.

Lovely acting all. I'm glad I saw the first hidden character, they've improved. Barcode's acting ❤️‍🔥, the range! I'd prefer less on the bed scene with Ta and Copper. They're playing minors here, so 😵‍💫. The toy rocking was 👌🏾.

ชอบซีนที่ไวท์ต้องอยู่กับฟลุ๊คแค่ 2 คน ด้วยสถานการณ์นะตอนนั้น เหมือนไวท์เหมือนไม่เหลือใครแล้ว เพราะไวท์มาทริปนี้ก็เพราะตี๋ ตี๋เป็นคนเดียวที่ไวท์ไว้ใจและสนิทด้วย ทำให้ไวท์ไม่สามารถไว้ใจใครได้เลย แล้วยังมาโดนฟลุ๊คจับได้อีกว่ามีปืน ซึ่งฟลุ๊คก็เป็นตัวละครที่โดนกดดันในทุกๆเรื่อง

มีความ aggressive และขู่ไวท์ตลอดเวลา ยิ่งทำให้ตัวละครไวท์ต้องเจอกับความกลัวที่เจอกับอะไรอยู่ก็ไม่รู้ ความ aggressive ของฟลุ๊ค และความห่วงแฟนที่ไม่กลับมาสักที เลยเป็นซีนที่มีความหลากหลายอารมณ์มากๆ ที่ถ่ายทอดออกมาผ่านตัวละครไวท์

อีกอีพีที่ชอบคือตอนซีนอารมณ์ช่วงท้ายหลังปอตาย ep4 มากเลยค่ะ มันทำให้เห็นอารมณ์หลายๆด้านของทุกตัวละคร ฟลุ้คที่ระเบิดอารมณ์ แทนที่เงียบๆตลอดมาทั้งเรื่องแต่กลับระเบิดอารมณ์ตอนที่พูดถึงเรื่องคลิปหลุด ตี๋ที่ไม่เคยกลัวอะไรก็แสดงความกลัวออกมา

หรือแม้กระทั่งท้อปเองก็ถ่ายทอดอารมณ์ออกมาได้ดีมากๆ มันทำให้เห็นหลายๆมิติของตัวละครมากๆโดยเฉพาะแทนค่ะ ทำให้สงสัยเลยว่าทำไมโมโหขนาดนั้น

ชอบตอนนี้มากๆ เพราะการเสียเพื่อนในกลุ่มไปเด็กๆเล่นกันได้ถึงมาก รู้สึกเสียใจกับเหตุการณ์นี้ไปด้วย และการกลับมาของท๋อปก้ทิ้งปริศนาไว้เหมือนกันเพราะเหมือนโดนของ โดนผีเข้า (?) แต่รู้สึกว่านี่ไม่ใช่ท็อป 😭😭😭

Tbh i love every episode but Ep 4 is my favorite episode because this ep hit different , this episode has very interesting and challenging plot , starting from the scene of the kids going to the temple to find Top, then showing one of the mask killers to the tense, ⬇️.

Replying to BebbiiHo: Moreover, in this episode we can see and get to know more deeply about every charachter's personality in this current situation. Like Fluke's personality, fluke seem like having calm character but from this ep we can know that he's not that calm , he's very emotional character.

Replying to BebbiiHo: And for Phee surprisingly he has calm character even tho he has to faced a tense situation.This EP is very appropriate to be used as a transition between present & flashbacks bcs at least we already know a lil bit about the personality of each character in this series

I thought Non was still alive. But if Phee is doing things with Jin. It means Non, really is dead from the preview of next week's. It looks like Phee would never do anything to hurt Non, as in cheating.

Tee and Top are on my hit list for what they did... Fluke too because he sat there and watched them set Non up from start to finish.. whole group was either too lazy / arrogant to come up with any ideas of their own & treated him like trash. robbed me of my Jin-Non ship too :(

ok i have a new theory: this whole thing was orchestrated by Jin for Non. jin was about to go abraod and they wanted to spend a weekend of partying to say goodbye. he convinces por to use his house, gather the crew, and the killing began as his finally "im sorry bro" to non.

I know White was low key dumb for looking at the video, not that I don’t understand why he did it. With all the secrets these people are keeping to themselves. But I feel so bad for him he’s clearly such a soft boy and innocent of all of this.
