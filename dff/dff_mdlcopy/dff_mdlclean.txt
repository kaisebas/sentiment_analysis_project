great potential and fairly decent execution yet suffering from unnecessary complexity
let me elaborate
acting performances
the majority of the cast consisted of newcomers all of them old and new faces did great ta mio and us particularly stood out but it was barcode who truly stole the show he was a cutie in kinnporsche however here he was as complex as a character could be and he performed it perfectly
storytelling
the beginning
the few episodes after the first one were hella boring and confusing there was a missing part that wasnt hinted adequately to the viewer while somewhat passable this highlights the need for betterwritten hints and suspense in future mystery projects to enhance the stories
the middle
youll find the most interesting events of the series here the moment non came to the screen the narrative underwent a significant evolution i couldnt help myself but to root for nons character even when he was doing things that im usually very against there was a decision of his i wouldnt understand if i missed why he would do it i feel clarifying the reason behind this decision could have enhanced the understanding of character motivations and justified phees future actions more effectively
the ending
while the last few episodes were interesting the shock value could have been dialed back certain elements felt unnecessary and overly complicated leaving loose ends and unanswered questions the final episode felt rushed and boy i would have loved an alternative to it
chemistry between characters
plenty at one point i didnt know who i was supposed to ship with whom because every pairing had quite the tension between them there were some really good spicy scenes too unfortunately almost none of them were plot driven but were there for well you know
overall impressions
despite its flaws this series clearly aimed for a level of effort and quality often lacking in thai bls the dedication of the actors screenwriters directors and crew is evident throughout this seems to be the beginning of a new era for thai bl series with higher standards and more refined storytelling bocs willingness to push boundaries is something i appreciate greatly and i would love to see what else they can give us especially with sammon on board cough 4 minutes cough
a thrillerhorror turned into an examination of how awful people can be
overall i struggled with how to rate this as there were parts that really worked for me and others that didnt i was also disappointed but not surprised when some viewers victim blamed the character non 12 episodes about 45 minutes each aired on iqiyi production company is be on cloud which also produced kinnporsche
content warnings murdersdeath bloodgore decapitation animal death vomiting bullying manipulation coercion mental health struggles suicides attempted suicide parental abuse beaten up grooming teacherstudent non con sex non con recordingsharing cyberbullying drugging
thoughts on victim blaming non
 consent is multifaceted one part is noncoerced and non was definitely coerced he was groomed by someone he had respected and felt he owed that person non did not deserve the terrible things that happened to him
 for people who said why didnt he just switch schools we dont know the costtransportation difficulty with doing that also i think non was an abuse cycle with the friend group jin was the little bit of sweetness that made non hope for things to get better and then when they were terrible it was difficult to break free viewers also forgot that non had been lied tomanipulated and believed the first thing was his fault and that he was mainly responsible for all of the awfulness happening to him update in episode 11 around 7 minutes non says if you didnt see me as a friend i could have moved to another school which confirms for me that non would have left if all of them had been terrible all the time but non had glimpses of kindness an that kept him at his current school
watch notes
 if you like horrorthriller and dont want to see a ton of bullyingpeople being awful watch episodes 14 then watch the beginning recaps of episodes 5 6 7 8 and 9 which are all flashback watch episode 10 thru the end
 if you like sweetness watch the first 5 minutes of episode 7 and watch episode 11 334125
 if you like spiciness watch the scene at 26 minutes of episode 9
what i liked
 mystery aspect
 the nsfwintimate scenes in the first episode and episode 9 were well done
 character actions sometimes felt realistic
 that they talk about not splitting up like in a horror movie
 sweet moments beginning of episode 7
 fleshing some characters backstories out
 flawed characters
room for improvement
 slowly paced for being a thriller flashback episodes 59 provided important context but they also interrupted the thrilling part of the series they could have condensed them or interspersed with the thriller part in the present
 there were 9 main characters and it took me quite some time to figure out who they all were and their relationships to one another
 jin got off the hook way too easy for something absolutely terrible that he did it felt unrealistic and was disappointing
 episode 10 was an exposition dumpreveal with some scenes wandering around the woods that dragged
 one character did not deserve what he got wish there had been some kind of twist with this character
 ending felt rushed and too much fantasy no way would hallucinations have been exactly like that wanted moredifferent twists and then the 31 minutes onward didnt work for me

a great series skip the last episode
normally i review around episode four or five but i really wanted to let this series show me everything it had to offer first so im writing this after episode 11 and will come back after the finale dead friend forever is a work of art i normally am irritated by mystery series because it frequently feels like all the answers are just being handed to you but not only did this show not do that it also didnt make me want to guess i just wanted to keep watching i wanted to see the story unfold i was continuously entertained
the characters are infuriating non included which is what would typically make me tap out but they also ensure the watcher has enough sympathy for non and hatred for the rest to create a good watchable balance regardless of what i thought of non or rather nons decision making skills i was extremely invested in him getting justice i didnt care how i just felt in my heart of hearts that pretty much every other character should end up dead to make a character so sympathy inducing that every other character becomes irredeemable is a feat on its own but to have nons existence not end up irritating me in the long run is a miracle this is spectacularly written awful people flock to a vulnerability and exploit it for all its worth and while each of them has their reasons none of the reasons justify their actions
this was an immensely fun watch id watch it again right now if i was that type of human but im more likely to leave it alone for some months to years to digest the sheer amount of awful is really fun but also really really sad
ugh i just watched episode 12 im not really sure how to rate this now i wish theyd spread out the justice across more episodes intead of all at the end i wish the ending wasnt open i wish i never had to see phee or jin smile again i wish new had a better ending i wish theyd had the balls to end it decisively instead of some did they didnt they bullshit this was a 95 for me before episode 12 so ill only dock two stars for this shitshow of an ending the rest of this series was good as far as im concerned this has 11 episodes and the ending we all wanted is what happened just off screen

fantastic but only after the fourth episode
i would never have thought at the beginning that i would give dff such a high rating because the first 4 episodes were pure guilty pleasure for me this mixture of 90s slasher parody seemed like pure trash to me but at least it was entertaining
but then came episode five and the tone changed so radically that you thought they had replaced the director from pseudohorror in an abandoned house it became a sad psycho drama about an outsider whose bullies took it too far and he had to suffer terribly as a result
its not always nice to watch and often gets under your skin but its always coherent and comprehensible
overall dff can be seen as a revenge thriller and in this respect it is completely convincing even if the start was very bumpy and even later when the abandoned house takes center stage again the whole scene seems a bit chaotic
in terms of acting you have to differentiate a lot here as there are mostly newcomers at work which you really notice at the beginning and the whole thing degenerates into total overacting but fortunately there are exceptions barcode whose performance as non is really so believable hovers over everything a little too weird a little too weak he is simply the perfect victim and his ordeal simply gets under your skin
but other actors also have their moments ta as the main protagonist who is also rather morally gray on the road and jjay as the emotionally cold young killer are quite convincing
the rest of the cast are mostly convincing in the quiet moments while unfortunately they dont always get the horror moments across well jet in particular seemed rather annoying to me throughout the series which wasnt necessarily just due to the role and he should urgently take a few more acting lessons
conclusion if you get through the first four episodes youll discover a dark and unsparing gem the fact that dff is so uncompromising and shows the emotional horror so well is its great strength and sets the series apart from others even if the acting is not always topnotch and the final episode is quite controversial i would recommend dff to anyone who wants to watch something other than the typical bl rom com
dff best drama

bad ending ruined best drama
to be very honest i liked this series very much till the episode 10 everything was so perfect story direction moral values characters their acting everything all was on top and so thrilles and excited but then they messed up with the story writing i last episode the ending was worst if i see it only on the baises of direction and acting it was good but the story and ethics are dead somewhere it seems some rushy to end the series
they killed the story line the justice the kindness morals goodness etc they killed all good values in the last episode the person who was victim i didnt thik this was the right justice to him a person white who was purely innocent got dead just because he fallen in love for wrong person i think now he is also a victim people who were real culprits tee jin are shown to get out and alive and people were just involved in bully they all got killed and the person who said he loved non very much is in love with the person jin who ruined his boyfriends life completely and now he is seeing happy future with him wow wonderful bravo and lastly a borther who loved his brother and seeking revenge for his borther he got killed i am not saying his way was good to take revenge but i dont think he deserves to get killed he lost his whole family brother mom dad and last his own life very disappointed drama as per the series if phee jin and tee deserve to be alive for there doing and i dont think others fluke por etc deserve to die specially white a part from this story writer if i talk about acting all the actors played very good and amazing job specially non  barcode best actor in the drama but i am really so disappointed with the writer he runied everyones efforts with last 2 episodes due to this rating is decreasing this series deserve a better ending not this i hope writer will adhere it for future
must watch if you are into bls with plot not revolving around ships
i love this series especially after ep 5  the first 4 eps can be underwhelming especially for the genre horror  thriller but after ep 5 the story starts to pick up in very in ways that is very investing  i personally loved it  warning tho no character is full white or black all of them are grey the series make it very clear  if you are not into it better not watch it  also some scenes of great importance to the plot can be rather underwhelming but its realistic ig 
the level of production cinematography is really good as expected from be on cloud 
the acting of barcode bump  mio is really good and this is mio  bump s first series too
in conclusion watch if you are more into plots than ships and need something different from typical bls
messy and gory fun
i will be the first to say that this drama was downright confusing af at times and it often felt like they were digging their heels in down to the last second trying to come up with ways to fill the runtime but for someone like me who is not a horror fan to like a horror drama and a gory thai one at that that is an accomplishment
this was all kinds of fucked up with a confusingass final twist but i kind of loved it they had me biting my nails covering my eyes and peeping through my fingers and shouting at my screen you dumbasses every week and you know what it was fun not to have high expectations nor be bored but simply just be entertained watching things get messy more shit be revealed and how impressively realistic and nasty the effects could get
amid all this i do think there is a message to be found here i didnt see it until the end though
these teenagers did objectively terrible even evil things to another teenager a difficult truth to accept though is that evil people or those who do something evil are not evil 100 of the time a serial killer can have saved a puppy from getting hit by a car does this now make them a good person no this just goes to show that people are complex creatures who cannot be boiled down into simple blackandwhite categories as much as we would like them to be
i absolutely recommend this chaotic disaster of a drama mind the gore though because there is gore and face stuff watch out for the face stuff

focusing on the ending and ending only
okay as a literature major with a passion for psychological thrillers and horrors im gonna be completely honest and very unhinged in this review so be warned also im writing this from memory of the last few episodes so sorry if i forgot or misremembered anything this is going to be a very long review of the final episode including what i though about the fate of every main character except for non
every character had an ending that corresponded to their role in nons death but i feel like the symbolism could have gone further
por por was the creator he oversaw the short film and was the director who wanted to create the film and took over nons script as his own the camera was also his too everything technically started with him he created the situations that caused nons downfall so he was the first to die he wanted the money back for the broken camera and in the end he died by tops hand the person who really broke the camera i think that was a fantastic way for him to go death by his friends hand without his friend even knowing what he was doing i was very satisfied in that moment when top pulled the branch out
fluke fluke was the observer he saw and knew everything that happened around him had he ever spoken up everything would have been different he saw top break pors camera he watched jin record non and keng and yet he continued to stay silent in the end he stabbed his own eyes and took his vision away he can no longer be the observer but i wish they took it even further i wanted him to cut out his own tongue or something equally as symbolic fluke never spoke up for fear of losing his future as a doctor now without his sight he cannot become a doctor anyway and would therefore have no reason to hide anything else but if his ability to speak was taken away it symbolises how it is too late you dont get to fix things after they already happened he lost his chance to speak up so now he never gets to speak again as graphic as that is i wish they went for that route instead of killing him i think him staying alive with no real future would have been the greatest punishment for him
top top was the destruction he destroyed the camera he knew about tee dragging non into the horse accounts he knew about non getting money from the teacher he was the one who spread the news and picture of non supposedly running off with keng that caused nons mother and later his father to kill themselves im glad his story ended in his death but i would have loved it if his death was selfinflicted because of the pain he caused others i wish in those visions he could have taken his own life instead of going down with fluke
white and tee for me as much as whites death broke my heart it was the perfect punishment for tee tee was the catalyst the one who put the blame of the broken camera onto non who manipulated non into earning money through his uncle and who was unwillingly the cause of nons death tee brought non into this situation then despite his best efforts non ended up dead this creates a parallel with white as tee brought white into this situation at the house then unwillingly was the reason white died tee the cause of nons suffering lived but now hes stuck with the trauma of killing the one he loved most but honestly as much as im glad he didnt die because i think living with the knowledge of what he did was the best form of revenge they had an amazing opportunity to create a parallel with tee and his dad and im kind of angry they never took it i wish instead of showing tee lying in his bed and calling out for white they could have showed him in the same situation we saw from tees dad walking along the street grabbing people and asking for white destroying peoples property and demanding they bring him to white showing that he completely lost his mind just like his dad would have been the perfect ending for this show in my opinion
newtan there were 2 potential endings i wanted to see from him the first was that he got his revenge and killed everyone in the house before taking his own life and the second was him living having never got the full revenge he wanted its hard to tell what ended up happening with that open ending all i know is that whatever happened i loved it an open ending to this kind of psychological horror is the perfect way to end this series but we better get a season 2 or ill loose my mind lmao
phee and jin i knew from the beginning i wanted everything to end with them phee was the main one i wanted to walk away from this mess not because i like his character but because i wanted him to live with his own actions he couldnt see what new was planning until the last moment and things were taken way too far because of his inaction people are dead because of him regardless of whether they deserved it or not their blood is also on phees hands i also kind of wanted jin to survive as well if tee was the catalyst then jin was the final straw recording and uploading that video was nons breaking point the original ending i had in mind was for phee and jin to have walked away from the house and gotten to safety thinking everything was over only to discover that things arent always what they seem generally speaking boc managed to create that ending for me which i loved but im still not completely satisfied if they are still at the house why would there have been a 2 year time skip i dont understand where they were going with this and i wish phee and jin walked away with more obvious and permanent injuries something like a lost hand or large scar on their face something that they will carry with them wherever they go and remain permanent reminders of everything that happened reminders of non and his fate truthfully speaking i thought this would end with phee having secretly been the mastermind behind everything so its difficult to comment on how else i imagined the ending when i really thought phee might be the one to kill jin
my final thoughts were that the theories for this series were better than the actual ending and either the open ending was in preparation for a second season or boc really just didnt know how to end this series either way there was a lot that could have been improved but im very satisfied with this series overall and ill definitely be rewatching this at a later date
not a thriller but a terror with a lot of gore
as a thrillersuspense book lover i would say if you are looking for a solve the mistery people planning smartly to behave partners or a cativating story thats not the one
first of all barcode did an amazing job it was my first time watching him and i could understand how hard his role could be making a fast comparison with his colleagues same vibes scenes youll get what i mean if you watch it
but besides the romance in the beginning witches i consider too shallow i didnt really get the warmess of everyones relationships because they keep skipping time to expose the story to you
all you have to do is accept it might be shocking it might not but you must endure all the blood spilled on your face and feel bad about things they dont even let you know yet i understand why the production chose to show this way but i cant stop thinking that they could do better
changing every time whos the guilty one made me hate every character and see that much selfharm just banalized the end of the story
at some point it doesnt matter how it is going to end because everything could happen since nothing did once go well for them they dont even care for each other dont look like friends thats all on exposures back
as my review the series isnt clear isnt relevant
just a reminder thats my opnion i would love to watch more thai horror series in future support always the cast they deserve love not only the one who i praised they all worked hard 3
an interesting project that got lost in the woods
oh boy what to even say when i started watching dead friend forever i was having such a wonderful time a fun if not particularly original concept a familiar cast for those who watched the hidden character and the promise of lots of bloody vengeful violence promised a great time i had a whole murder board of clues going and did weekly recaps with my friends for a while this was one of the best titles on a line up of five or six actively airing shows and then it really went wrong dff feels like a major case of bit off more than they could chew from every department
the full review
story
while there were a few high points the story for dead friend forever was incredibly uneven some characters like non and tee got beautiful and moving individual story arcs that really explored the depths of their guilt anger and pain some characters like white fluke and top barely manage to scrape their way out of the second dimension the writers never quite managed a competent ensemble and most characters had little to no connection to each other despite being friends for years through extremely traumatic events
on a grander scale the plot was even worse the authors had a horrific overreliance on flashbacks the worst example being a detailed flashback after a previous episode segment that contained most of the same clips forcing the audience to watch them twice in a row i hate this device because it creates one certain history as opposed to allowing characters to liemisremember and denies the audience the more interesting scene of getting to watch the characters argue it out and react to the various betrayals and shocks
finally i wont spoil the details of the ending but a single propplot washed out so many of the intriguing clues and mysteries with a singular and pretty stupid answer i used to look forward to rewatching this series to see the little pieces and exchanges i missed but it slowly became clear that that wasnt really going to be a concern anymore most of those clues are just red herrings for the audience to chew on while they wait for the grand reveal
acting
lets start with the good barcode is a phenomenal talent as always non proved to be a monster of a demanding tragic role and barcode handed him very ably despite his youth and relative inexperience while some of the horror scenes got a little repetitive mostly due to the authors all of the most emotional and raw scenes were really beautiful hes a joy to watch jjay and ta were powerful acting partners for him rising to create some truly genuine interactions that carried the heart of the story fuaiz and bump continue to improve as well
the rest of the time yikes despite an overreliance on flashback as opposed to watch two characters have a difficult conversation the acting still managed to be largely melodramatic with a lot monotone shouting and unnatural flailing in some of its worst moments it was difficult to tell even broadly what emotion a character was supposed to be portraying i never did decide if some of these relationships were genuine friends with benefits revenge it was that unclear in the acting i think that the stakes in this show were simply too high and too distant for a largely rookie cast to grasp effectively
production
for the most part dead friend forever provides its usual level of quality expected by a be on cloud production lighting set dressing costumes and props all look great with a few minor continuity errors that we mostly found because we were looking so hard for clues it was a joy to pick out little details around the set that enhanced the story and provided clues i dont have an issue with the quality of the show here that said editing could have used some work i know this genre deliberately obscures but time and distance became so unclear that it genuinely began affecting my understanding of the story
intimacy
 i was not a fan of the way intimacy was handled in this show most of the nc scenes did not connect smoothly with the plot why did we need a teewhite sex scene or the choices being made for specific characters outside of their nc scenes phee is different in the sheets i guess i dont think this story was the appropriate place for sex for sexs sake intimacy as it was not a romance and i dont know that they adequately justified most of the nc scenes they did choose to include i would have liked to see more thought and work go into connecting these moments to characters involved and the relevant plot
in all i have actively withdrawn my recommendation of this title to most of my friends i will definitely not be so hasty to recommend an unfinished show from this team again
this review may contain spoilers
exciting yet disappointing but somehow good idk
this was something very new i love some thriller and dark stuff but they rarely make scary or dark themed bls so i was really happy when this came out the mask that haunted them was actually scary the whole plot of seeking revenge was so exciting my problem with the show was the fact that they made me hate tee jin top fluke and por [since they were pieces of shit and were responsible for nons miserable life and death] so all i wanted was revenge just like non and phee and tan did and i was loving everything because i thought the show was going in that direction until the end but then they started throwing some flashback so we would feel sorry for tee and started putting phee and jin together like no jin was actually one of the worst among all of them but i guess the public will forgive him since he did it because he loved non haha lol gross at the end i hated everyone but white and he was hurt so i got mad i wish non was still alive but that wont be possible the ending was interesting because they probably never left the house but im too mad to think of a new season that could probably not even have barcode
about the acting barcode did everything honestly he deserves an award he was absolutely spectacular i have no words to describe how good he was cause he just delivered the most crazy character of beoncloud

be on clouds attempt at scripting a thriller fails
dead friend forever dff started out rather slowly paced gained a lot of momentum in the middle however by episode 8 the show provided too much unnecessary exposition and plot that did not quite tie in and fell short in their resolution which resulted in a subpar finale however as a slasherhorror series it delivered on the scares gore and delved into the horrors of the human mind which acts as a cautionary tale against bullying and being complicit in the face of others wrongdoings

highs and lows series
for a horror i was scared or had goosebumps just for the first two episodes and then it was quite dragged until ep 6 with the backstory and reveal of the culprits behind nons disappearance it was entertaining and barcode did fucking great job but then when it returned to their timeline i was quite disappointed with how it was solved new was a maniac but random killing few people even white who didnt even freaking know non was bullshit tho top with his wounds wouldnt get out but it could end better way like phees father could come for them and take them to hospital which would finally end this crazy manslaughter but instead it end with an open ending and what for guessing if they got out or not its not really satisfying and half of the final episode was just about what we saw before but different the hallucinations didnt have to be shown when we knew nons taking revenge on them in all of the hallucinations which they had and instead someone could finally take them out and end the case but otherwise i really enjoyed the series and actors chemistry with each other
series my got
the cost of renting equipment is very high the crew and the actors will be under a lot of pressure here are the young men im very proud of them these are the boys who are more beautiful than the f4 flowers i feel they are equally beautiful it says f4 but in heart there is only one person copperphuriwat right from the first pilots i noticed he since then ive been looking to learn about him ive seen him in our days and tiktok in the previous series he was a cute boy in every action in dff hes more mature and charmingboc must win the lottery to get him a beautiful son with a good family background being obedient and having a good personality will win the love of many people i want this to be the first of many of my next films it must be very famous my dear

season 2 when
i have so many thoughts and feelings about this show it was so entertaining and i would get so excited every time a new episode aired anyone who likes plot twists thrillers or revenge plots need to watch this immediately also some of the best acting ive seen in a while from multiple people in the cast i felt so bad for non so many people treated him horribly even though i like ta and copper together and their chemistry is good i wasnt a pheejin fan because i gradually started disliking jin as the episodes went on the character who interested me the most was surprisingly tee even though he definitely had the most to do with what happened to non you can tell that he is a victim of his surroundings he was such a wellwritten character where you strongly dislike for obvious reasons but can still understand most of his actions based off the finale there has to be a second season coming and im also very excited for that and hope it keeps the magic that the first season had and i hope that newtan is actually alive
i fucking love dff
i fucking love dff great ass show
it is a good show because i love jjfuaiz  jjfuaiz is dominating the bl industry with their passionate acting and overwhelming chemistry that exceeds the limits of language and culture they are truly a revolutionary pair and exactly what we needed after builds fatass left boc and we lost soldiers biblebuild
jjfuaiz is singlehandedly saving us from the trenches and dragging our asses to freedom and victory god bless jjfuaiz  jjfuaiz is the napoleon and josephine of our time absolute true heroes
jjfuaiz are beasts when it comes to acting they are cooking up a storm everytime the camera is on those two let daddy cook no let jjfuaiz cook theyre the goats of the industry for real and nothing will ever top their absolute w a tier acting
i fucking love dff
when 6 eps feels like 12
i cant believe this series is only 12 way through
it feels like these 6 episodes have taken an eternity even skipping some of the overacted hysterics bad direction repetitive and ridiculous adlibbed dialogue and choppy pacing ugh my head hurts
my one takeaway is that everyones acting has improved since the hidden character
if you want to watch a thai killer thriller that is smartly written and wellpaced with a sinister creepy vibe watch delete
i tore through that in one night it was perfection
great acting and well written bl series unique and one of a kind
id highly recommend the series because all the actors have put in tremendous hard work and it was really well done even though some aspects didnt sit right with me i genuinely enjoyed most of it especially episodes 17 where phenomenal a 1010 for real the storyline towards this end did get a bit questionable but the beginning episodes were enough for us to be hooked on to it the cinematography was one of kind with amazing editing the bl series wasnt cheaply done and when you watch it you will definitely know
the actors really put out amazing performances even though most of them were rookies
this show is definitely award winning in my opinion as it ticked all the criterias for me
please do watch this series because its not like other bl series that we normally get this is different and spectacular

great series with some flaws
before this review begins
i love dff the series amazing
i a fan of horror mystery bl gl comedy and romance finds this series exciting and believe itwill appeal to different tastes
the series started well the actors did a good job playing the characters and lets give hats off to pbarcode because i dont think anyone else could have matched the pain agony or sadness that non felt throughout the series with no one to support him by his side he killed his role
i loved every character and it was impossible to hate anyexcept uncle joeyou will know if you watch
even the ending was great i loved it but i would have loved it even more if non was aliveyeshe ded 00 what really shook me was that they never stopped hallucinating
now let me get to the reasons why this series did not get a 10
there were flaws despite the things i liked in this series
1 it absolutely got me embarrassed that no on found out about the camera like how did no one know about it till the end my guy por didnt even get to know the truth before he perished into hell
2 fluke was blamed for nothing yeah say im nagging i dont care fluke did nothing too horrendous from the beginning all he did was call non greasylike everyone else did and he was extremely selfish he didnt do anything that physically harmed non he was justthere hes a coward a selfish damn coward thats it
3 tee doesnt trust his friends with his baby boy likehow da why to be honest its not like they were gonna make a move on him also im sure white could defend himself besides what could they have done nothing
4 still thinking non should have been alive
5 dat ending was disappointing as fook i need a season 2 or an explanation for it a special episode at best
despite all of that i loved the series tore through it in two days and trust me thats not normal for me loved it3 and hope for a season 2 because boi dat ending was not satisfying i swore to sleep myself across the face if i didnt like the ending and i had to slap dem face of mine

dff tried too hard to be different
this series has probably the worst case of plot developmentplanning ive seen recently the main issue is the wish to be different and way too mysterious boc loved saying this was the first bl with a murder mystery and thats where they got it wrong the first 4 episodes are terribly boring nothing really happens while a lot of things happen but how its all filler
once the flashbacks are introduced the series is light years ahead in terms of quality and actually starts to have a story episode 5 out of 12 is when the series really happens for me boc missed the mark by not including flashbacks since the first or second episode we dont even meet the main character non until episode 5 thats a bad move
regarding the ending everybody dies is the best case scenario i didnt think boc would actually go for it the only character i could see living and it working well would be tee being alive is his big punishment after causing everything that happened and literally killing his boyfriend the only innocent person saving jin would be a major letdown since he actively caused nons spiral and helped destroy his life with that video all because he was jealous
i love barcodes original song for the series
what was that endinggggg
this show started off with such a great potential i was really intrigued and the story line was really interesting but the final episode turned that around the whole episode made me incredibly confused and explained absolutely nothing its really a waste of such a good show to end it like this im also so disappointed with phees character overall 1112 episodes were really good but yeahhhh it just feels like a waste i must say with such a young cast they all did a really good job especially mio portraying tannew
mediocre
its a good thing that someone took a step to make horror with gay characters but that doesnt mean i will ignore the obvious plot holes unnecessary and abandoned plot devices that were completely forgotten out of nowherethe ending is quite fitting for a horrorthriller if done correctlybut it was not done properly with many loose endstoo many questions were left to be answered to call it an open ending rather call it and incomplete endingopen endings does not work like thatseemed like the writer didnt know what to do with it anymore
as someone said in the comment section that the writer of this show has a tendency to do that as the same thing happened in manner of deathshe did not improve at all rather worsened a biti see her potential so if she really tries i think she can do a good jobsome actors really did good but some of them were overdoing it time to timebut overall it was okay
as a huge fan of suspense thriller horror etc genre i hope that upcoming projects of this genre will be better
in conclusion the comment section was much more interestingso many creative peopleso many weird people
very bad at the beginning much better afterwards but an unexceptional ending
it gets off to a very bad start messy excessive directionless and frankly not very well acted these actors generally have trouble with intense scenes i almost gave up
then the story takes a step backwards and the story becomes more interesting the whole is much more coherent and we begin to understand theres a desire to get away from the traditional manichean schema and this complexity is welcome karma plays its part which is logical for a thai series
but the last episode ruins it a little the aftermath should be more developed and  without wishing to spoil anything  the very end is rushed through with more questions than answers im okay with an open ending but this ones just too confusing
in short this could have been a great show in the end its just okay
after that finale i got fucking noooooothing 
just finished episode 8 and it has me in my fucking feelings my baby non everybody he trusted turned on him everybody even though phi decided to fight for him in the end he still walked away when he needed him the most but his hurt was justified but you see that teacher tee jin por top fluke all of them needs to die non is no saint but he didnt deserve that from them for people to sympathize with jin has me confused the apauler is worst than the theif he did not just stand by while non was being bullied all of them needs to fucking die and i hope tan is non brother and phi there for revenge as the lady said in got let it burn just finished episode 10 and they all still needs to die just finished episode and am like wtf ending is that

intruging premise that fell flat
wanted something a little more dark for halloween and was recommended this series i went into this completely blind and had little to no expectations for it but was somehow still disappointed
what i liked
 interesting and intriguing premise
 barcodes acting this was my first time seeing seeing him act and he definitely stole the show
 liked how they were not afraid to depict flawed and downright heinous main characters
 when ta phee and mio tan were introduced in the middle of the story with their real motivations it truly felt like the turning point of the show and when you can see the revenge plot actually start
 unpopular opinion maybe but i liked the ending love how it tied back to nons actual script in the sense that no one ever really leaves it nicely added to the dread and mystery of the story plus it was a very fitting end tomost the characters white deserves better lol
what i not so liked
 first few episodes felt boring and directionless nothing really peaks your interest to keep going
 revealing one of the main charactersantagonist non so far into the story was not a smart choice pacing wise
 the horrorgore element felt cheap and poorly executed at times like im sorry i could not take a scene seriously with that damn mask on screen other times the deathsbloodinjuries just felt out of place and unnecessary i get this is a horrorthriller but sometimes it just felt bloody for the sake of being bloody with no actual direction
 a lot of the acting specifically when characters were supposed to feel terror heartbreak or were crying felt extremely underwhelming and awkward
 although i did like the ending there were too many plot holes and loose ends to even call it an openambiguous ending more like incomplete ending it being so rushed left me wanting more from it
overall
the series triedand fell flat props to the actors for doing what they could with what they were given but unfortunately it could not save the story for me i would not rewatch nor recommend this but i do hope this series opens the door for others to try something different in bl dramas like this again

where to start
this show has taken me on a roller coaster for really wow just finished it and i have so many questions
the series was really good different from any bl series which is good horrormystery and bl a prefect combination if you looking for something different then this is the show for you
starting off with non absolutely loved him from the beginning he was just a typical kid trying to fit in and make friends and with that i sympathize with him cause everyone wants to fit and belong now he was too trusting and that was his downfall and i understand that as well he was just innocent and a pure soul i didnt like how they used him and later died got something he didnt do justicefornon
phee makes me so at the end i loved him in the beginning with his relationship with non and then there was doubt and trust issues within the relationship and that is also unhealthy when new and phee come up with their plan and it works and things unfold in the end it seemed that phee is willing to betray pnew but forgive tee nah that was not cool at all
new the brother that looked for justice got his was my favorite i loved him until the end of the show wow wow he is your ride or die kind of person all he did was try to find answers on what happened now he was left all alone no brother mother or father it was so sad and i cried the most for him like it was just so so sad  loved him till the end
all of nons friends were not friends they were terrible until the end all looking out for themselves and they died in the end jin tee top fluke and por just terrible friends
in the end it was all a hallucination and they didnt make it out of there so it makes you wonder what happened but white didnt deserve to die at all he was an innocent baby
overall it was a good series and i recommend it it gives you a taste of something different if you like mystery stores plus bl
should have kept it simple
i wasnt quite sure what to expect going in to dff but it really got me hooked in the first episode though there were some frankly unnecessarily explicit sex scenes for a thriller the setup to the plot was done really well
eight college friends take a trip to one friends house in the woods where theres no internet or cell service to get away from the stress of school and have a big party before one of them goes off to study abroad our mainish character phee ta finds an old recording of a short film that 5 of the friends had made back in high school  but theres a 6th friend in the video that phee doesnt recognize that 6th person is non barcode who went missing after filming the vibe turns eerie as they attempt to remake this short film only to feel as though theyre being watching suddenly bad things start happening and with no way to contact others the 8 friends are left stranded scared for their lives
i assumed this show would take the typical cabininthewoods horror movie idea and turn it into a tv show however the plotline started to become overly complex as it delved into the backstory of the original short film breaking up the tension at the cabin really did a disservice to this show as it felt like it had to do a lot of explaining over the course of multiple episodes just to get the audience to understand what was happening i felt like i was waiting to get out of the flashbacks and back to the cabin to figure out what was happening i think they attempted to make this show overly complex which ended up not working in their favor there were too many characters and too much messy backstory for what could have been a really great thriller not to mention the show gets really goreheavy towards the end however as i expected from beoncloud the budget was clearly pretty high for this one and the effects and production were great as was the acting i think they lost themselves in the story a little but it was still very enjoyable to watch

actually pretty well done
going into this i didnt really know what to expect there was quite a bit of hype built around it when it first came out so i was quite excited to watch it
the story is very interesting its new and i think they did a pretty good job in developing it we get various characters all with their own individual flaws and baggage you come to despise the characterswhich is not a bad thing at all obviously especially when the characters are inherently bad people as the story continues and we unpack this very complicated layered story when we are first introduced to the couple tee and white i was so in love and then when tees personality is given to us i was just hoping they wouldnt show any more romance between them cause i knew i wouldnt be able to enjoy it but they managed to use the romance to add more devastation which i thought was actually genius its not just a stupid romance in the midst of this disaster but rather used as tees and whites worst fears and punishments
the ending i thought was perfect like i was not expecting that at all and it suited the storyline i think
the production was really well done i dont know if im insane but at the beginning of the drama the camera work takes on the found footage style when we have super dramatic scenes like running in the woods and fightingarguments the camera shakes a lot and follows the actors in this almost rapid way that gives off the impression that its not by a professional camera crew that we as the audience just happen to be stumbling upon whats happening to these boys in the woods and then as we go back to the past and more of the story comes out we go back to that production and camera style we are used to and i thought that was a cool touchif i registered that correctly
they also really managed to give the drama this eerie uncomfortable feel to it that i really liked they really had me flitching away and genuinely scared
i thought the acting was good especially taking into account that most of them are very new actors i was more impressed by how great they did in really dramatic scenes that need really good acting to pull off like in the last episode mio left a wonderful impression on me i think he did an absolutely great job
this was actually a pretty good watch i really enjoyed it i think they really did the plot justice

exciting and great show but bad ending
i really love it but i really didnt like the ending its so bad i had a very small hope that the ending would be better than that in order to avenge his brothers death tan caused the death of innocent people
i feel sad to phee and jin white too he was so innocent and cute
tee was bad but he got a bad life bad uncle his life was tough and it made him do this still tried to fix what could be fixed but unfortunately he was unable to do so
disturbing and unpleasant but not bad
an interesting concept for a story its strong qualities id say laid on the plot and the character writing they portrayed well the disgusting and shameful part of society giving a sense of realism to the show which is something that i appreciated however the thriller part lacked in both acting and execution on the drama part the performances were actually good but the genre of thriller is a bit more demanding in many scenes the emotions of terror anguish and agony either felt extreme or underwhelming fuaiz and ta were the only ones who rose to the occasion and acted very naturally with convincing reactions for me a better guidance from the director or choosing more experienced actors on that part might have done the trick so its a yes to the story and the plot but no to the direction and acting on the thriller part
i would recommend it to anyone who likes darker stories though the drama part is actually pretty good and worth giving it a shot
ps its one of those shows that you might need a second watch just to pay attention to the details and the character reactions on the early episodes

amazing but a bit confusing for me
beoncloud have done it again the budget budgeted the acting was incredible and there were the perfect amount of nc scenes as someone that came form kinnporsche it was so great to see more of barcode as well as us and 2j the production and direction was perfect
the only thing is that i need to rewatch it because watching each ep weekly meant i ended up so confused as id forgotten what happened the week before i didnt understand the ending at all and in my opinion the storyline got complicated doesnt mean it was i mean that it was complex and makes you think but it was very interesting i just had a weak brain and memory between eps i didnt know what was a flashback what was a hallucination etc if i rewatch it all in one go im sure it will make more sense but honestly the story seemed a bit convoluted at times
it was so powerful though it really had me questioning the morals of all characters  i was feeling sympathy for characters that had done awful things and whites death had me sobbing so hard he was the only one that didnt deserve anything to happen to him
basically i got confused and still am a bit but the actual show was phenomenal acting production special effects maturity all perfection i cant wait for more series from boc
rollercoaster ride
this started out interesting slowed down got emotionally disturbing then downright insane
i ended up liking this and all of the effort the boys put into making this my biggest problem with this was the confusion caused by constant flashbacks i had a hard time keeping the timeline straight
let me say this made me cry so hard i had strong emotions about each and every actor in this series whether it be love hate pity or utter contempt i usually cry pretty easily while watching emotional series but never have i been driving home from work and thought about what i had seen and burst out crying in the car
i dont know that i can recommend this to anyone im still traumatized and dont really wish this on anyone else maybe you are tough enough to handle it
good but could have been better
although be on cloud come in for a fair amount of criticism they do need credit for doing some different things
on the whole i did enjoy this series though the execution was a bit messy and with a slpit personality having a completely different feel to the countryside and school based sections
it didnt get off to a great start with the audience being thrown into the deep end with scenes involvong 8 of the main characters and it took a while to actually get to know each of them and they did overdo the hand held camera style in trying to give it a dramatic style
i dont think i would really class this a s a bl more as a drama with some gay characters as that aspect doesnt really play a major part much of the time however when there were kissingnc scenes at least they were more realistic as per kinnporsche and not like on gmmtv
the bullying was almost uncorfortable to watch at times but barcode really stood out frrom the rest with his acting peformance particularly in episode 11
so obviously a 2nd series is planned though possibly a big loss with copper moving abroad so i guess he might not be in it
le pongo un 9 como el ao que viene no haya segunda temporada voy a volver y le voy a poner un 1

okeeiiiiit really hurts
okeii i was really hesitant about this series but after reading the review i decided to watch it and literally completed under two daysbut i wish shouldnt have watched it  actually before watching the series i had got many and many spoilers but after watching it it feel like spoilers are not that bad because i was really for all the emotional scene or any other scene they all are the ass and even dont want to talk or write about themi think white and newtan deserved more sorry to say but i really hated pheehe should continue to help tan instead of falling in love with jinand the most i hate is jinhe said he loved non and what the hell did he done ok last not the least non is also not that good but i can understand him when h got to the darkest part or time of his life and that teacher helped himbut i m not saying that everyone should cheat only and the othersteepor fluke they are just assi really felt bad for metanwhite and the family of non
i only want to say that if someone is hesitant to watch this series it is best not to watch iti kinda feel that i shouldnt have watched this seriesbecause everyone is

nonnew were done dirty and the ending is dumb
while the series did start off a little silly and campy i actually enjoyed it at face value for what it was however when the story starts to backtrack to the past explaining what happened with their old missing friend non it started to become much more different and interesting from your typical slasherhorror genre the drama between the group of friends and how the story progresses with non falling into a deeper and deeper pit of unjust situations helps you as the viewer to empathize with non and despise the group of friends who all had a hand in his downfall mio athens character tan later known as new was what i was hoping to be the corrector of said injustice brought upon his brother with the revenge plot twist investing me further into the plot than i already was so imagine how disappointing it was to watch the final couple of episodes where it feels like its all thrown out the window like many others the final episode especially felt extremely rushed to me the hallucination sequences all felt goofy and ridiculous within the final episode as well and what really dealt the final blow was the 2 years later bit of the episode where it ends with the most cliche uninteresting and basic did they really leave or was it all just another hallucination trick super boring and unimaginative not only that but the death of non and new had me more mad than anything else in this show tees uncle just gets away with everything and the family is never avenged which even if it may be realistic still leaves a sour taste in my mouth that makes me never want to rewatch this series overall i appreciated it most for the middle episodes where i felt the story and writing was strongest its certainly given me a lot of mio edits to watch in repeat 810

good overall but barcode award worthy performance
for this drama the title alone would compell me to watch it the fact that it comes from boc the company who gave us kinnporsche and mansuang makes it a mandatory watch and it was a good watch but was it up to standard well yes and no the theme revenge thriller is an original choice in blland and for this kind of theme i expect a solid story taking me to a climax and having me root for one or more characters on the way
the story is solid enough theres a clear line even with the flashbacks and  forwards but i could not root for any of the characters they were either too shitty or too obscure to identify with in the friend group there are a few identifiably archetypical characters but not all of them are written in to be a real part of the plot the ones that are essential to the plot are lacking in detail so were left wondering about motives and patterns what made tannew go so insane what about jin makes phee fall for him
the only character i could feel was non barcode seemlessly goes from sweet and innocent to dramatic and psycho and then to mysterious and sad it was a thrilling experience that he can do that t such a young age with so little experience cant wait to see more of him
there were some annoying plotholes what happened to the opening scene this scene is not in the movie they made and is never mentioned since what happened to tees father and the most important question who killed mr keng since jin keeps seeing him in the hallucinations could it be him and speaking of hallucinations what kind of stuff is this and it has an antidote and it works with just a whiff of it in your nose but not if youre wearing half a mask like i said annoying and sometimes distracting from the story
im left feeling that if barcode did not do as well as he did i might not have enjoyed this series half as much go barcode

a surprisingly good revenge story
i really didnt expect to like this one but here i am
ill be honest the horrorgore genre is not really my thing so when it started with a masked killer on the loose  la scream and some deaths i wasnt really into it but i continue watching because the story seemed interesting enough  and i was right
we quickly discover that most of the main characters from the start are all aholes and we root for the two guys that want revenge or at least one more than the other i was hopeful that white was part of the plan but unfortunately he wasnt and ended up dead when he was the most innocent one of them all what a shame ive read that some people didnt like what new was doing but i was rooting for him all the way okay he didnt have to kill them all but it was actually very satisfying to watch them suffer pardon my sadomasochism as for phee i really liked him until he fell for jin which was  i think  a betrayal on news revenge does he deserve what happens to him i dont think so but i would have it liked better if he was totally on news side and not spilling the beans as soon as hes alone with jin
concerning the aholes thats how im going to refer to them none of them deserved mercy top was one of the worst because he was the cause of all nons problems as he was the one breaking the camera just because of his ego and being the coward he is he couldnt come clean to por and had to find a scapegoat
tee is not too close on the scale of being an aholes as he is the one that led non into his trap and used him for his uncles benefits and even though they tried to bring sympathy for him by telling his backstory i couldnt forgive him for what he did to non  he is still the main reason why non dies in the first place as he is the one who drugged him and brought him up to his uncle while knowing perfectly the consequences of his actions  he cant convince me otherwise
por is at the top with top and tee the three of them were the ones buliiying non the most by calling him greasy and treating him like he was nothing he used him to his own advantage and i dont care that it was because he wanted the acknowledgement of his father hes just a rich kid with rich problems and i couldnt care less about him
people wont probably agree with me but to me fluke is the worst of them all yes he did nothing but thats the whole problem he is as guilty as the others and the fact that he wanted to be a doctor is even worse because how can you want to be someone that helps people when youre part of a bully group thats just hypocrisy also the looks he gave non was not pity at all unlike jin so he didnt even regret seing all those things and doing nothing he just let it happen and hes the biggest aholes in my opinion especially when hes the one that probably killed por just because he was about to talk a little  i know por was gonna die anyway but he literally shook him when he had a stake in his stomach just to shut him up he also took the gun from white and pointed it at him when he had absolutely no reason to act this way hes the worst
at last jin i kind of liked him at the beginning as he was the only one nice to non and he genuinely seemed to like him but who stays friends with the bullies of their crush thats the question that i was asking myself the whole time because im sorry but why did he stay friends with those aholes when he witnessed how they were bullying non  whom he was supposed to like he witnessed the whole thing and did nothing also he made nons life worse after recording that video just because he was mad that what non didnt like him back anyway they tried to make him a good guy in the drama by shipping him with phee but this couple didnt work for me after the whole nons bullying backstory
i would finish by saying that non is no angel either i was really rooting for him at the beginning as he was bullied and used by those aholes but the fact that he cheated on phee  who was the only one that was loving him for who he was and wanted to help him  i couldnt be on his side anymore also he continued being used by his bullies even though he knew they didnt consider him as a friend and i couldnt understand why he stayed with them when he couldve changed school and be with phee
to conclude on that i really liked this drama and i recommend it to anyone who likes revenge stories i am also glad to see barcode and ta in another series after kinnporshe i already liked ta as macau but i didnt quite like barcode as porschay in this series however he really shines and shows that he can play other roles than the innocent boy who falls in love with the bad guy calm down i know kim wasnt a bad guy
oh and i almost forgot i love the ending i know a lot of people dont like it but i thought it was very surprising i also want to know the truth about all of that but its good that it keeps its mystery

what the was with that ending
do i recommend it yes yes i do
lets get into it
okay so we started out in our time which was kinde interesting because it makes you want to know what happened with non and why he disappeared
then we went back in time to where non was stil part of the group what the hell was with the name grease  you see what happened with the friends and the teacher little disappointed that it ended like that with the teacher and that we didnt really get a back story about why he was looking into the whole mafia
the we go back to the now and thats where it gets weird by now we know what happened to non or do we
we know who phee and tan really are and we see who the 9th person is
and then the last episode and i have no idea how this series ended yess i saw the end but they didnt escape everyone is dead everyone is alive who knowes
did i like it yes the last episode was hard to watch
am i happy with the ending well it was interesting but i truly hate open endings like this
do i want a special episode yes please i need to know what happens next who died who survived is non still alive was it even real or where they hallucinating

great drama terrible horror
it took me forever to start this series simply because i couldnt get past the first episode
the problem with dead friend forever is that the horror element here is extremely poorly constructed and executed at times it felt like the series was going down a path like nightmare on elm street at other times it felt like scream and halloween and sometimes it felt like bodies bodies bodies
but the reality is that the horror here is from a lowbudget school project the deaths the makeup the killer and the mask are all so weak so silly
the drama present in episodes 5 to 8 and in episode 11 is simply the best part of the series and i really wish they had explored this side more and really built a more elaborate suspense and worked the horror in a more psychological way
because all the scenes in the country house are terrible and weaken the plot a lot these scenes can be summed up by the characters screaming and crying and screaming some more which is done in excess here and is totally annoying the construction of tension fear and distrust is poorly executed and is based on the conveniences of the script and a magic drug that makes everyone hallucinate about non
the twoyear time jump is something that cools the plot and i hate it it makes no sense for por top and fluke to keep apologizing for hurting non while they are hallucinating at no point do they feel any sympathy for him and no drug can force that
if phee and tan had discovered the truth about what happened and revealed it to the group it would create a much more interesting dynamic
because the essential thing in a slasher horror is the suspicion of who the killer is and that doesnt happen here
if developed they would all have motivations jin because of the guilt of what he did and because his friends lie made non get to that point por because top broke his camera and made him be reprimanded by his father and end up in this mess fluke because his friends lie risked tarnishing his reputation as a future doctor phee and tan for the obvious reasons
and in the end all of them in the cabin being hunted by a killer would be amazing but the deaths are weak especially por and top the confrontation is simply the characters screaming a lot and there is no tension the series relies on the drug that tan created and everything becomes too fantastical
there really is something very interesting here i love the middle of the series and barcode simply shines in an impeccable performance but it lacks nuance and the foundations of a good horror it lacks a sharper direction that knew how to develop the plot instead of having the characters yelling all the time and it lacked a cleaner script that really removed all the unnecessary parts and created a bloody revenge drama
because thats what this story is a revenge drama
but the series mixes countless elements here  slasher horror psychological horror supernatural horror and syfy horror and ends up delivering anything the last episode is a mess and the open end is a big no
great performances and an impeccable drama but it needs a more elegant and precise editing direction and script to be a good horror series

season 2 is needed
i read that there wont be a second season but honestly the open ending needs clarification imo ofc it can be up to the audience imagination of what couldve happened next but honestly i like having a clear understanding of things and not just something i have to guess or imagine i know there is a special episode though idek when that will be released or if its even going to explain anything but i hope it does clarify some things now onto the whole story first of all literally everyone except non newtan and a white a little made me the least angry everyone else deserved to die now call me harsh or heartless but like they all did non so wrong like a whole family was wiped and why because they all didnt like non because he was like the outcast of the story non deserved so much better and i wish he wouldve gotten proper revenge phee had his reasons to be angry at non and its understandable but honestly falling for the dude that lowkey made all hell fall down is just insane it infuriated me jin also understandable why he felt that way when he saw non and the teacher but like dude you guys werent dating so like womp womp get over it non was literally being manipulated by a whole ass adult when he was in a harshstressful position and mr keng took advantage of that and used him and he was also getting bullied by jins friends and all jin did was talk to non after all the bullying and telling him that hes on nons side and blah blah blah instead of actually standing up for him while the bullying was happening but instead he just stayed back and watched it happen nah man now por not much to say he deserved to die so glad he did he was trash no excuse same with top total asshole fucking despise him glad he died as well fluke dude was playing it safe while also watching shit go down he didnt want to get involved in anything but at the same time got involved in everything by watching everything happen and not doing anything about it well deserved death too now tee is a weird case i didnt like him either because he literally did the most damage to non but he also had his fair share of fucked up shit happening to him and like that explains his behavior but doesnt excuse it he didnt die but his love did so karma got him good im satisfied with that now dont get me wrong white didnt deserve to die and it was a little sad but i didnt connect with white that much to feel that much towards him dying literally the whole show just put me in the same mindset that nons brother had and i just wanted revenge for non because of how mad all the bullying and mistreating made me feel lastly i hated how tan died he didnt deserve that and i wish he had lived thats the part that made me the saddest and its mainly because it wasnt just tan that died but tan non and their parents as i mentioned before a whole family was wiped and for what revenge doesnt even describe what they deserve they need more than revenge thats why i wish there was a second season and also because of the ending which is basically up to our imagination to guess what couldve happened did they escape did they not are they still in the house did something else happen who knows but anyway i know i sound like a psychopath with my opinions here but overall it was a good show it kept me entertained and gave me a lot of emotions worth the watch theres a lot of sad scenes and angry scenes a lot of chemistry and just overall balanced well in all places
ethics are dead
embark on a paranormal journey of revenge to direct us into a deeper and cruel perspective of life that some people are too corrupted to disregard morals and principles honestly the first few episodes were meh and almost dropped my expectations from the show not until the revelation of nons backstory happened and everything seemed to get more interesting
bullying has continued to ruin several lives since then the story fueled my anger toward the students knowing that at a young age these guys are already minions of satan not even a single character from this show is lovable everyone has a rotted personality indeed birds of the same feather flock together
a mess but the kind of mess that attracts ones attention plot after plot happened but i feel disappointed in how they concluded the show in an openended type of finale without giving proper justice to the victims i am rooting for newtans vengeance on what happened to his family he deserves and has the right to be the sole main role here and not anyone else
thank you to jjay for reintroducing me to the show which i used to ignore during its airing period it was a good drama having a wellestablished storyline from beginning to end yet the execution was weak to moderate it has the potential for a sequel that can discuss the aftermath of the chaos in the vacation house the public sympathy for the fallen victims and resurfacing another revenge plot against those who survived the bloody party and i would like to see the adults too being imprisoned and perish in hell

its nice and feels different
horror story but not much of an horror as people are saying i started watching at 3am didnt feelsee the horror
i really hate the end wtf was that they just left us like that i would have preferred if it ended with investigatorscops arrive at the house to take the corpse of the boys that way we can be sure they all died at the house or if one survived instead they just made us know the guys where still in the house and havent left yet so does that mean it wasnt two years later then maybe it was just few hours later  or was phee just thinking too much
personally i could understand why phee believed they were still in that house after all with the disappearancedeath of 5 people theres no way it wouldnt have been announced after all they all had families even if they dont the would have neighbours someone close to them
apart from that its a really nice drama hoping for a part 2continuation but not in the form of a series maybe a shot film that would explain the end like is everyone or did everyone die or not if no who survived
i want happy ending  i have lots hope and i want punish all culprit including jin
i like your story too much  but im very afraid about ending 
i can relate this stroy personal and i want everyone deserves punishment including jin 
i know first love is so precious no one can take that place 
that why i request to the director and its my humble request to you sir please make happy ending and phee and non together at the end please otherwise you break lots of heart here

the rating for this should be minimum 87 and dont let mdls bullsht tell you otherwise
do not sleep on this show
if you like the genre for the love of common sense remember to read the tags people and if you are not shipping obsessed and unable to look beyond actors you like and bl love story tropesbasically if you like a show that isnt simply a commonplace bl then this is must watch dont let the rating and the abysmal comment section scare you off either this show served and the ending hit just fucking right
when you first watch it that first ep youre gonna see the nc scenes and feel like it seems forced and a lot like theyre trying too hard to push the bl and sex stuff for the sake of views right and wrong
right about it feeling forced because they did dump the bl sex clickbait in the first ep for real but
wrong because they do it for a good reason its not because they were baiting fans its because they wanted to clear up the superfluous romance shipping shit quickly in order to move on from it and boy oh boy did they ever seeing as how for the rest of the show the shipping stuff gets sidelined and completely trumped and in the end this show delivered and the ships sinking was all apart of the fun
the goodgreat
 first and foremost the acting this is some of the best if not the absolute best actual acting ive seen in a thai bl i didnt know any of these actors and i honestly dont gaf where they acted before because this is the show from which i will remember their faces if you watch this and you dont appreciate how well these actors did this show is wasted on you
 the plot from start to finish the amount of intriguing questions and speculation and ideas this shows plot raised was just fantastic the comment section here quickly turned to a mess because of the conflicting opinions and theories and ill be honest if you pay attention to the comments made by nonship focused users some of the conversations were really interesting and yet even with all the speculation we were all still wrapped up waiting to see what twist was coming next that is good writing that is how you hook your audience
 non and tannew i mean these two the casting of them as brothers gold the best part was we dont see it coming we pretty much all suspected new was either tan or white but it still hit with so much weight when it finally unraveled and the escalation right up until the end was such a sweet sweet pay off
 the flashback scenes and the drugged scenes revealing their individual guilt are prime story material in this wow just so on point and so well depicted
 the horrorgore aesthetics and cinematography are all on point
 the order of death and doom ima tell yall the truth for a hot second i was nauseous at the idea of phi and jin making it out and ending up together happily it was so ick and i would have deducted a full point if that had been the true ending of this because jin is trash like all his friends tee appeared to be suffering well deserved but jin walking away when even his internal guilt revealed how shallow he was i was about to be mad af lol but nah they didnt do us so dirty they didnt close this show with some shipping nonsense they really hinted at it though just to fuck with us a little more and then said nope in your dreams literally because i reckon jin is the one imagining that sad pathetic happy ending for himself 
 my theory the fake out happy ending is jins pov i think hes likely comatose possibly induced to stop him from anymore self harm because jins face when phi ran back into the cabin did yall see that split second expression on his face man looked wide eyed and gone phi went back in and he took a bottle to the head and even if he did manage to shoot new whos to say that what happened next wasnt phis injured addled brain trying to sort his shit out give him hope i dont think he necessarily got up after shooting new i dont think he saved tee before new had strangled him and then new died bleeding out and jin jin is the only survivor just like the script but hes totally fucked up in the head and maybe he lost it completely because he went in there and saw everyone dead see what i mean yall the show is done and im still over here speculating
the bawait nah
 i aint even mad about that unnecessary sex scene between phi and jin because after that fantastic ending ep its revealed to us just how wrapped up in the idea of love and sex jin was imo every scene in this show served a purpose of revealing things about the characters to us and that sex scene was the only scene i couldnt place until the final ep when i found that that scene explains jins level of love and sex focus first he became romantically invested in non who never even showed much interest in him and then he got mad seeing non sleeping with someone who wasnt him thats extreme then came along phi who did show interest and even slept with him and also said nice words to him and seemed so sincere i think jin was really affected by how he felt for phi especially after sleeping together and weve seen that all he needs is a little push to go from 0100 whether its for revenge or falling for phi again also i think that scene was meant to show more insight into jins perspective of sex how he seems himself during sex because some of his hallucinations in the final ep matched the viewpoints of the sex scene with phi raises questions makes him more layered in a way a little more interesting but still very ick
okay now the bad
 the people who watched this for the ships and the actors they stan and could not see beyond it yeesh justyeesh
the highlight
the overall quality of a bl slipping so smoothly into a horrorsuspense story needs to be appreciated
  the ambiguous conclusion  it wasnt exactly what i expected but in a way it was even better
people might say what about white and the old dude who got decapitated but in reality irl plenty of people die in bad situations due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time and this is exactly what happened to them the situation was bigger than them new wasnt interested in screwing up his revenge for two people he didnt even know he is beyond guilt aside from what he felt about non and in the end he got his revenge they were collateral and he died fairly in the process
so yeah this show is absolutely worth the watch so long as you like the genre props to everyone who put work into this because they did an outstanding thing here and i hope this show gets some more exposure outside of just the bl fandom because it deserves a better and broader audience people who can really appreciate it its a horrorgoresuspense thriller with lgbtq characters if you ask me and labeling it a bl as the status of bl currently stands is not enough
i would definitely recc this
ps watch the final ep to the end post credits the funny bts they show were somehow just the perfect contrasting cherry on top
the story
dff is actually the best thai bl series ive ever watched the story is soo fucking good the present and past stories have been showed in a very good waythe scripwriters should be credited the mostthey wrote such a fantastic seriesthe directionproduction are also fucking goodthe cast has been very goodtheir acting skills specially barcodehe is portraying every situation so welldff is indeed a very very good seriesmaking me fall in love with thailand more hard
my favorite series
i think the series is very good although there are still some bad points to say its perfect but they have good ideas i very much respect the daring thinking of the film crew and really love the actors who have devoted their best the way of working in a film crew is very fastpaced so i respect and admire these beautiful guys they dare to show bold scenes according to the script but its very artistic thanks to the love scenes the series is very attractive to viewers my bias is copper the most beautiful guy ive ever seen every moment hes on screen i pay full attention not just because of his beauty but also his charisma and reallife personality oh im in love with this man
definitely creepy in a good way tho
firstly i would like to start with the story it is fucking spooky my legs went completely numb as i kept watching it was super scary until like episode 4
after episode 4 i started to really get whats going on with the storyline
so definitely a great story its creepy spooky and they also have good ass dialogues there
the cast definitely was my favourite part
i dont know if im kinda doing favouritism but the cast stole my attention on first sight
i got even more excited when i saw barcode and copper on the cast
im not joking i jumped 25 ft in the air out of happiness
i mean the music is not really there but the little spooky melody at the intro always gets my legs shaking
i mean its kinda scary paired with the background of the masked murder chasing after the boys
i feel like rewatching this series over and over again until i would have enough of seeing it
also the story is not that easy and a dumbass like me needs explanation so i guess rewatching could help me understand better
overall fly run and flip in the air to watch this series because its so damn good
also great for people that get along well with horror
the series has thailands best and first mindwork
first of all i like the actors faces theyre all really charming i usually dont like either one of them but im impressed with the whole cast my bias is copper and i really love him there are some people like jjay mio who dont act well thats the truth i think you should learn more  in general the series is much better than the normal bl movie market dff is more advanced that anyone who is a fan of boy love movies should watch i really respect boc for their willingness to spend on the movie oh i really hope the dff cast is famous i only like the actors in dff who can make me write 5000 words they are very talented
the plot and ending
im satisfied with the ending if this series ended with an happy ending then i would have really been disappointed but glad it ended with an open book the acting was superb especially non he portrayed the innocence the pain the betrayal and the character of psycho very smoothly the others cast acting was also good as for white he didnt deserved to die like that he suffered all those just cause he fell in love with a wrong person at a wrong time
there is really no reasons to not watch it
the reason this series caugh my attention was because barcode is acting in this and the trailer seemed really good im glad that my expectations for this series didnt disappoint at first lets talk about the actors
this was my first series from be on cloud i have seen barcode instagram and youtube and i was truly amazed by his acting i have never seen the other actors but i think i just fell in love with them their acting is so good they made me cry smile and made me think im going crazy you could also feel the characters emotions very well
this plot deserves an award i could never predict what would happen well maybe some parts the story seemed very original to me if you love thriller and action watch this asap
this series is a 1010 for me well produced amazing actors and original plot there is really no reason to not watch it
this review may contain spoilers
be on cloud never disappoint
okay first of all can we congratulate taa for such amazing acting like damnnnn his acting is such an eye opener of his presence in this industry i mean i could barely notice him in kinnporsche and now hello new bias hahaha anyway lets talk about the plot first i really love the bl thriller series it makes me all focus and i did not skip of certain part at all which i find it damn interesting except that i wish there is more to it the plot is already beautiful by its own but i wish they could do more elaboration of what happened at the end like how can they never left the house did phee inhale a different drug so thats why it is too strong that they did not realize they are still stuck in the house and also i wish they would elaborate the plot to be each episodes one by one of the cast died and i feel like the ending seems rushed like the realization scene is quite weak it looks like phee already know that everything is just hallucination and just informing that to jin which again realization scene is weak if they wish to have a better plot it would be awesome if at the end of the series non suddenly appeared like phee jin how did you know each other like it turns out that he is still alive and he just went for hiding
they have such good potential plot twist plot but seems rushed ending i love behind the scenes episodes though hahaha im crying that they are too goofy xd xd xd
i have no issues with the character i love everything about them and twisted revenge relationship though just that i wish there is more for the plot will definitely rewatch them again and taa im coming for your fine ass 3 hahaha
an excellent series miscellaneous episode
usually i write reviews after episodes four or five but i wanted to give this series its full rundown first so im writing this after episode eleven and will revisit after the end a piece of art is dead friend forever mystery shows often upset me since it seems like everyone is handing you the solutions but this one not only avoided doing that but also didnt entice me to make any guesses i found myself wanting to see the story to continue since it kept me entertained
the characters are annoying especially non included which usually makes me lose my cool yet they in order to achieve a good watchable balance make sure the viewer has enough contempt for the others and enough sympathy for non i cared a great deal about non receiving justice regardless of my feelings for him or rather my opinions regarding nons ability to make decisions i simply felt in my gut that almost every other character need to die i didnt care how it is a remarkable achievement in and of itself to create a character that elicits such strong empathy for the other characters that it renders them unredeemable but it is truly miraculous that nons presence does not eventually consume me this writing is amazing horrible people seize an opportunity to take full advantage of a weakness and while each has a valid motive none of them
game changer in bl
i cannot recommend this series enough it just ended and i will be thinking about it for weeks to come
classic thriller with a really compelling story these young actors did a great job i see so much potential with jjay and am very excited to see what he does in the future all the actors did well but jjay really stood out to me
this series was confusing in the best way the ending was wonderful its openended and you need to come to your own conclusions
im hoping this genre appears more in bl i will be rewatching how can you not
this review may contain spoilers
played with my mind
its been a rollercoaster watching this series i cannot just put out any of my reasoning ability  to describe define or defend any of the character in this series
the acting of the cast was freaking good i salute to that
the story is also complex as it gave me chills and surely played with my mind
me not being fan of horror was a bit hesitant to watch this series but after i started it  damn i was hinged
some highlights
1 in the beginning the characters felt soo dumb but then i was convinced that usually in horror characters are usually dumb so we can cancel this out
2 i will never forgive the writers for killing white that poor soul his only fault was that he loved the wrong guy
3 not even one character of the series is likeable except white  but thats also the the best part as well as everyone is flawed
4 cliffhanger after cliffhanger never fully completes some plots i still have many questions maybe there will be a s2
5 wtf was the ending it was already weird that phee and jin were living a normal life after all thats happened but the plot twist and then sudden ending  
6 a lot of people liked to be the jin apologists but sorry not me  i absolutely disliked the character also felt coppers acting a bit stiff than others  but thats still okay as its his first acting project would like to see him more
8 ta barcode chemistry is electrifying
9 ta copper chemistry  jawdrop
10 top class acting from the entire class
waiting to get a final closure otherwise i wouldnt be at peace

twists all the way to the end
i liked this a lot if you prefer fluffy this isnt for you not as spicy as bocs kinnporsche but it does have the ass slap heard round the world thanksta the only part that was hard to watch was the backstory of nons disappearance there was 1 episode where i had to just hope barcodes character would kill them all in a later episode because the bullying was so bad i liked the whole cast and it was nice to see some familiar faces again we got to see how the characters changed over time there were things woven into the story that led viewers down wring paths for solving what was happening i know some viewers didnt like white dying because yes he was totally innocent but then life isnt always fair a lot of twists and turns that you wouldnt be able to figure out on your own eg the drugs even the last 10 minutes surprised me and i like that
this series was so insane i cant say i was pleased with the ending but it was so insane every episode you thought you had theories that could be true but they just outdid you the cast is next level genuinely the acting was insane each and every person in that show should be so proud because of felt like i was watching grammy winning actors the show i was so excited to watch every week it really was so so interesting i dont have many words after that last ep but i would recommend this to everyone
dff better than expected
before i write this review ill be honest i didnt expect much ive watched thc and to be honest some of their acting was so so but i gave dff a try because the plot was so interesting and its better than expected i judged the boys too soon because oh wow their acting improved so much yes of course some scenes had lack of expression but its barely noticeable this show makes you anxious since episode 1 and im only in episode 3 and it keeps getting better and better it has so much suspense and build up im excited to see what actually happened now on the editing side lets not forget to give credit to boc and their amazing cinematography if theres one thing boc is amazing at is definitely their editing colour and cinematography skills everything was well shot and edited overall kudos to everyone involved
respectfully how this series even get like 80 rating 
seriously why are you guys giving this series like rating more than 5 are you guys ok
i honestly doesnt find a joy even a bit in the first episode it was a mess
nonsense storyline unrealistic story meh acting i was tried to watch this with no expectation but yet i still dont get over how terrible this series is i sense there would be very bad story in this series so i will just keep going to watch some interaction but it didnt help
judge me because i only watch like 2 episodes but again it wasnt my fault either ep 12 was huge turn off to begin with i guess my standart is way too high  which is i think its good for me
i really loved this unique series in thai industry
why this rating is lowi dont f care about ratingsthis is a revolution in thai industryi dont really understand what to hate about this storyits not a stereotype lovey dovey fluffy bl its not even focused on blbut this show is definitely not everyones cup of teaif anyone into just bl they shouldnt watch this
i started liking it from the ep 1this series carried many emotions of mine and obviously it was a rollercoaster of many theoriesi didnt expect this much since it was bl and on the top thaibut it really exceeded my expectations
at first i loved it for the perfect castbut one after another i was really into storyand then the music got meevery character portrayed perfectly  thats the prove from how mauch hateloveadmire confusion they got from usspeciallly bracode and miobarcode in only 19 but how he was into his character really deserve enough appreciationand for mio it never felt like its his first time or he is not a professionalthen comes my favourite jjay and fuaizthey nailed it wonderfullyta was successful to show his character properlyeveryone did great despite being new or old
the ending was really mind blowingno need of season 2 or special episodeif anyone cant handle the ending i said before its not everyones cup of tea
overall its really a fine product that i needed
i was totally into dffit deserve 1010but we all can see good things never get proper appreciation
more horror than bl but fabulous
to be sure this series was far from perfect but it so grabbed my attention from the beginning and never lost it of course the story got a little wonky way too unnecessarily complicated and so deep into the weeds in detail that i thought i would love my mind trying to figure out who was doing what to whom but overall what a ride this story is a classic story of haves against havenots the privileged against the disadvantaged it is a story about a group of friends who take advantage of one particular individual whose skills are something they lack but want they bully cajole and manipulate him into thinking he could become one of them but of course he never will the ending is stunningly creative and unexpected and had a feel that we were watching a version of a grand guignol theater perhaps that is why i loved it so much this is wellcrafted remarkably wellacted with a bit too much detail in places exceptionally dark perhaps too much so yet overall so fascinating gripping and captivating one of the best bls for 2024 with a frightfully deep doleful story

triedd
so thai bl acting has this thing yk where its not good so this doesnt deviate i got into bl almost 2 years now and i think its really the only tv genre where people exuse im not sure for what i watch ep 1 which wasnt bad this is defiently a mystry which i was intriguied about i started ep 2 and understanding the dire of a sitution these boys were in i cant possibly exucse their acting if i love tv dramas as much as i do yes most bls have iffy acting sometimes its noticable when cringy but you move on cause it doesnt hurt the plot this was the opposite i wanted to continue to see barcode cause i believe everyone when they say he steals the show but a show cannot be good with one good actor i dont speak thai but i cant help but feel like i am being pissed on when people praise the show will i see shit on my screen also i felt they were dragging things and its more admirable if a write can stretch a mystery but you dont have to be bored
about dff
wow this is really got me from the 1st episode im so happy to see familiar faces that we used to love in kinnporsche era
anyways if we talk about this series its a group of 8 friends went on a vacation in a mountain house in the middle of a forest and other tan the 8 friends there is another friend of them that only a few people know its supposed to be jins farewell party before hes going abroad to study but it turns out that they have to face many mysterious incidents which occurs by something or someone
the story plot is very interesting and its based on the thailands mythological urban legend about the actors overall i like their acting but still it need to be improved usnttr is doing a great job with his character i must say that the music choices are great
im still a little bit confused about what happened to non  barcode anyways lets find out
if youre searching for a horror bl based story then i think you should watch this overall i like it even its the 1st episode still
lets see whats going to happen to this 8 friends
it was meh for me i would add this to my list of what i casually dropped
i would add this to my list of what i casually dropped why 
months before the series air i was already excited and thrilled to watch from both the summary and the concepttrailers but when the episodes started being released i didnt start watching it right away until there was enough episodes released to bingewatch instead of waiting to watch once a week
so on this day there are 9 episodes out of the 12 annoounced that are already out so i decided to watch it
the first minutes were interesting lets say the 5 first minutes then they started to get into the plot what should be good right  well no because first the group of friends that from what i understood were supposed to know each other for some time now  two years or plus were just so awkward to each other even sideeyeing some so i was like wtf then the acting and the way it was filmed felt really cheap im sorry if im being ruthless but thats how i felt
i wouldve loved to have the nerves to go further in this first episode and more generally in the series but they didnt managed to got me hooked i dont think i would even give it another chance later
just for those who want to know i watched 17 minutes into the series
