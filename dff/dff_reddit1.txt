The Director (Ma-Deaw) of the historic and award winning "first" Thai BL (Love of Siam, 2007) who also Directed Ohm in Ma-Deaw's also award winning Dew The Movie and then icons of the Thai BL Series Industry MaxTul in their last Series together which was the First Thai BL to break into the mystery and crime genre, which was groundbreaking (Manner of Death). And Manner of Death written by Sammon now coming back with Dead Friend Forever as a screenwriter (authors of novels being involved in the screenwriting is so crucial)...these are ALL good indicators.

Yes BOC had issues and they were rookies but regardless the production of KinnPorsche was also groundbreaking.

So now these same people breaking BL into a new Genre (Horror, Suspence, Gore) yet again with actual BL and intimacy (given the press release about the parents of the actors having approved the sex scenes, makes me assume there will be intimacy. It is a copy/paste of the press release they put out when KP aired minus the line about the parents) ... I mean this has got to be entertaining at the very least but IMPORTANT TO THE GENRE OF BL for sure, so I am excited 😊

Helps that it's streaming in IQ as well, I'm expecting all out gore and NC-17 in true horror fashion...Barcode's photo placement leads me to think perhaps he will be our final girl, but I hope they surprise me.

One episode in and I am obsessed! We're getting an actual HORROR series, and it's got the gore and the sex. They are hitting all the horror beats and I'm honestly here for it; group of partying friends, cabin in the woods, communication cut off, some dark secret from the past...I'm not even mad, let's go.

I'm digging the killer design too, hard to give us a slasher with a good visual concept but I'm into this one, less is more but this is effect. And I'm into the practical effect, yess!

The premise is straight forward, the stage is set, and I'm in!

Episode 1 - Timestamps 

*so I don’t ruin anything 🔥 = sexy time 💀 = scary/gore time

1:50 - animal death 💀

19:00 - sexy time with Tee/White 🔥

21:30 - EXPLICIT sexy time with Jin/Phi 🔥

26:10 - graphic impalement 💀

29:00 to about 31:00 - more of our impaled friend, they show it a fair few times in that scene. 💀

37:00 to 39:00 - more of the impaled 💀

If it was a movie 💯 that would have been the case, but we got 15 episodes to go so we can’t be knocking them off too soon… my guess is they’re maybe a little infidelity hinted at as well

I feel like they were cursed by the first movie since the ones that were there before were the ones that were seeing the ghost, and Phee, White, and I believe Tan were the ones that weren't there last time, and didn't see anything. So maybe the ones that were cursed were bringing back new people to the place for a sacrifice (to Non who is possessed by the spirit now??), like the story Por was telling on the car ride up to the cabin. We'll probably see more in the flashbacks, since we know that the characters are acting creepy in a school setting.

At least, that's just my guess as to where it might be going.

I love that this his horror first and BL second. The location is gorgeous which is par for the course for Be On Cloud. I want to live in this cabin (ghosts and all! The creepy shrines all around are just the icing on the cake). I also like the practical effects. It feels very old-school horror. As a true horror fan, I was watching the background during that entire BJ scene expecting something to pop out. They left negative space around Ta's head, which was excellent on the DP - the original Friday The 13th did that a lot to great effect - when you leave negative space in a movie where you expect something to pop out all the time, it creates tension with the audience, especially when it doesn't happen, but the tension isn't popped by a jump scare.

I also like that the dynamics aren't typically BL relationships where it's meet and flirt and fall in love. We already have an established couple and a couple with a messy history. Give me more BLs (and GLs!!) with established couples!

Right? It’s hitting all the traditional horror tropes and I’m here for it. I’m seeing it going a couple of ways in terms of plot but I’m gonna let them cook. Even if it’s predictable I’m just happy it’s an actual HORROR series.

Really liked your background info on framing and horror. Alot of people just think horror is a bunch of jump scares and opening medicine cabinets. But, done right, horror can be absolutely haunting and beautiful.

The last Thai horror/BL-ish series I watched was Shadow, which was a major letdown. Then I ended up rewatching Remember 15, which was better but not blow your socks off.

Really REALLY hoping this series takes the charge forward and blows expectations out of the water.

Jump scares can be effective if used right, but most of the time they are used really wrong because they kill any mounted tension by making the audience laugh at themselves for getting 'caught'. If you use a jump scare and don't let it ramp down the tension, but just as an extra layer of the ramp-up, it puts you really on edge as an audience. Unfortunately repeated jump scares are the hallmark of bad horror movies.

I think they used jump scares effectively here because the quick pop of the 'ghost' or whatever didn't have any moment of relief where the character (and viewer) could go 'haha I'm just being stupid' and go back to a normal heartrate.

I'm also just glad to see a horror BL that's NOT vampires. I mean, I like vampires, but I'm kinda sick of romantic vampires. I want my vamps to be evil predators, dammit.

Here for it. SO HERE for it. Just to bring peace to some people, the characters in the present day are in their 2nd year of Uni. So the NC scenes are among "adults". The cinematography is excellent as BOC is wont to have and the kisses... THE KISSES!!!! TOP TIER. I have the worst headache but I had to watch. 🙌🏻

Also I'm so down with Phi and Jin having already a backstory which will speed out the kisses and everything else. 👀

So the characters are in Uni in episode 1. Fuaiz, the actor who plays White who has an NC scene was 17 while filming. But his scene is really well crafted. So yeah, you arr gonna see a 17-year old actor kissing as a Uni student.

I've watched a lot of horror flicks and have to say this is the most generous killer I've ever seen... lending a helping hand to the young lovers and leaving an injured and totally helpless victim for someone to come and rescue. By the time he showed up on the road with the scooter boys I thought he was going to pop out with a spare tire like "Ya'll need a little help there?"

I didn't expect THAT intro at all. I actually didn't expect anything but the kids had really natural acting expressions. I really laughed at the random funny lines istg. I'm defo hooked at the story now and will be following ✨

Love how we got right into the story in episode 1 with tons of things already happening!! Wow, both couples are 🔥🔥🔥. That tension between Phee and Jin and the looks they were giving each other were 😳. I was definitely a little perplexed at the abrupt ending with the next episode preview playing right away.. also with the after credits with the deleted scene and behind-the-scenes clips.. I was wondering if I needed to watch to see any extra scenes lol..

I am glad that they are not shying away at all from the horror aspect. I can't wait to see how it will build every episode. It's interesting how the group is a mix of people who were present during the past incident and also people who have no idea who "Non" is at all. I'm looking forward to the flashbacks. There are a lot of relationships to uncover. I wonder if we'll get some more info on Phee and Tan since Jin commented on those two having some kind of relationship.

Watch process of a scaredy cat

Watch without sound, subtitles only, distractedly on the phone. Tilting the phone allows to see general shapes without being scared. Able to see steam and characters.

Watch without sound but with direct visuals. Just put sound for non scary scenes (which we know about because first watch). Steamy steamy.

Watch completely and hide when you know what is coming so that only sound may be scary.

You aren’t wrong, but you pretty much just summed up the horror genre, characters are pretty one dimensional and we get right into the slashing.

You could start digging into the psychology of horror and how ultimately the audience often roots for the slasher, but I think in this instance they’re just pulling on the traditional slasher tropes. Episode one reel them in, and the background will start unfolding over the next episodes

horror movies usually lay the groundwork at the beginning, usually with a killing or at least letting the audience have a peek at the upcoming…shenanigans (couldn’t find a better word lol), and then gives the audience time to know the characters. this had lots of characters to introduce and was too fast-paced to really work as the introduction to a 12-episode series. i’m sure we’re gonna get to know everyone better eventually, and hopefully they won’t be one dimensional, but my main issue is: where do we go from here exactly when everyone already knows there’s something creepy going on? will EVERYONE spend the rest of the show on fight-or-flight mode? this was too much too soon imo. but idk, guess we gotta wait and see!

I think they started off this way because they're going to do flashbacks etc and things may be 'calmer' there, so they wanted things fast and furious, so to speak, in this episode to get people hooked.

That's one episode down and 10/12/15, depending on your source, to go. Not sure I can stand all the hysterics each week. Gets tedious very quickly. At least Friday the 13th and all the other horror movies are over in two hours or less. This feels like we will get all the sequels to them at once.

So, in my opinion, Thai horror is a hit or miss. They either do real good at it (Ghost Lab, Shutter) or real bad (most of the other "horror" things). I'm holding out for this one, though.

I was /real/ nervous about Tee and Top when they were on the moped, that's for sure. I'm really sad about Us' character, not because I'm particularly fond of Por (he's real stupid) but because I love Us. However, he kinda got what he deserved for making stupid decisions lololol

All in all, I'm so looking forward to this tbh. I can't wait for the next episode!

One thing I cannot stop thinking about is that Phi (Ta), White (Fuaiz) and Tan (Mio) are all confirmed to have only transferred to the school in 12th grade + have not been there the last time the gang came to the house with Non (Barcode). We got plenty of scenes with Phi & Jin - Tee kissing White in highschool uniforms though so I'm guessing it's /after/ the 1st cabin in the forest shenanigan? So there will be at least 03 periods of time to be unraveled since that's the only way the story's gonna last for 12 eps imo.

Grade 10-11 (-ish) with Non - Meuk (isn't Meuk & Non the same person? He was the one in the mask choking Top & was single out for being "weird" right?) + 1st visit to the house to film the movie. Tee wore the killer's costume here too? Jin seems close & protective of Non kinda. I'm curious about their dynamic here aside from their shared love of film making plus the way Jin looked at Non too lol there was some interest there definitively. Also some notable tension between Tee & Non ???

Grade 12 - bloody toilet & haunted highschool halls? Non disappeared. Phi-White-Tan transferred to the school & befriended w/ the gang. Tee & White dating + Phi & Jin hooking up - Tan is hinted to have been involved somewhat so he might have had a crush on Phi? Idk. Jin being obsessed with filming everything including him & Phi hooking up at the school ??? I NEED to know how the scene w/ blood splattering on Jin's face while he slowly smiles like a maniac plays out !!! Also I'm guessing Perth's character will play a part here.

Present days where the gang is in their 2nd year of uni. It's kinda suspicious that if so much bloody gory haunted shit has happened for the last 4 years of their life howwww are they so calm going back to where it all begined lol ??? It doesn't seem like their memories are altered since they still remember Non? Will they start killing e/o (Fluke w/ the gun - White slamming ? a possessed ? Por ??? Tee acting suspicious).

I don't know the specifics of DFF, but some possibilities I can think of:

- use of double-sided tape

- guard/modesty garment (e.g. "sock")

- one-sided underwear/thong
