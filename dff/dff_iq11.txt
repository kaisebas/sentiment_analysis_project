Tik tok had me so worried that this series was gonna be so bad. They were so wrong tho. It's amazing. The storyline, the characters. Everything was just perfect and the ending too! I absolutely love the way the series ended. I need another Season to this ASAP cuz what.

I think the ending is implying that everyone died in the house the only thing I found disappointing is that poor white died he was so innocent on in all of this. I have to say I don’t blame new if someone destroyed my family like they did I would want revenge as well

Questo BL Thai totalmente diverso dagli altri mi ha entusiasmato vederlo, mi è dispiaciuto tanto per NON voleva solo essere amico di quei ragazzi ma loro l'hanno ingannato ed è morto, gli attori molto bravi soprattutto il personaggio di NON fantastico. lo consiglio💖💖💖💖💖💖

Wow! Props to the whole team. The actors did a fantastic job. I knew not everyone would like the ending. But I did. I love a mystery. Maybe a season 2. Please BOC, make it happen =)

Loved most of it. The actors and all the crew did fabulous. It was a bit too gruesomely bloody for my taste in episodes 12. I’m severely disappointed in the ending! Where’s the happy ending???

You know the biggest surprise for me is that Tee actually had a conscience but it kicked in wayyyyyyyy too late. But I do feel bad for Tee’s situation however, still doesn’t justify anything he did to Non.

Yessss, exactly! I would’ve given up on trying to please the Por and the rest a LONG time ago. He kept on trying and it led to this. Not that I put a tenth of the blame on him, there’s still a little. It was Tee, Top, and Fluke who chose to be horrible people to begin with.
