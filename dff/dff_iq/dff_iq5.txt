this was genuinely the most heartbreaking episode so far. seeing non constantly manipulated and bullied was so hard to watch. not to mention fluke being complicit in the bullying.. ughh makes my skin itch. let’s just hope there’s a silver lining in the form of jin :(

Love how everyone in the comments is saying that they feel so bad for Non, which I do too. Like this poor man just wanted friends and ended up getting taken advantage of so much. Then there’s also me, an actual writer saying “yeah, that’s that’s the writing process”

Also, genuinely think that only the ones who hurt Non should be killed, like leave White alone, Leave Phee and Jin and Tan alone. It should only be the original guys who die. Like Tee, Top, Fluke all them should die, not the others

Does anyone else think the guy that plays tee looks a bit like mew? I'm really enjoying this so far, I love non and white, jin seems ok at the moment and so does phee.

นาทีที่ 26 เป็นต้นไป ฉากที่ชอบ สุดท้ายแล้วอีพีนี้ก็ทำให้ทุกคนเห็นด้านมืดของแต่ละคน ทุกคนล้วนโกหก มีทั้งโกหกเอาตัวรอด โกหกเพื่อนสืบหาความจริง แล้วสุดท้ายความจริงก็ทำให้ทุกคนรู้ว่าทุกคนล้วนเป็นต้นเหตุเรื่องแย่ๆพวกนี้ด้วยกันทั้งหมด

ชอบ ep5 มากๆ เพราะเป็นจุดเริ่มต้นที่ได้เห็นเนื้อในของตัวละครแต่ละคน ท็อปที่เห็นแก่ตัว ตี๋ฉลาดแบบชั่ว ฟลุ๊คเป็นอิกนอแร้น ปอกลัวการไม่เป็นที่รักอยากให้พ่อยอมรับ จินที่รักตัวเอง นนท์ที่ถูกกดดัน เป็นตอนที่หนักหน่วงอย่างกลมกล่อมค่ะ แถมน้องบาร์โค้ดแสดงดีมากด้วย ดูซ้ำบ่อยมากๆคับ ;—;

They've done an excellent job of creating a whole bunch of pretty despicable characters for this story. Yikes! I'm sure there are a bunch of plot twists to come but it's startling how many bad decisions can be made by a small group of people.

See I completely understand why Non is haunting them, they don’t even have to fully explain the backstory anymore, I would haunt them too. The only decent person is Jin. The reason to hate Non? He’s introverted? Wants friends? The lack of AT LEAST impartial treatment astounds me.

I have a theory that the person Non is texting with the heart emoji is someone in the group and they are helping him get revenge. I think maybe Tan because we didn't see Tan and Top get separated after the motorcycle accident, so I think Tan did something to Top. Just a theory.

This episode was hard and I felt so bad for Non. And worst one was Top, Tee and Por. Even if Tee is suffering it doesn't excuse his actions. I hope Jin's kindness is just kindness and he doesn't have an ulterior motive behind his actions. All in all it remains exciting

I'm more inclined to believe that Jin's "kindness" is fake and that he has an ulterior motive. He somehow tolerated his friends' crappy treatment of Non by not holding his ground and not being firm in condemning their actions.

His family life isn't that great. The only one who didn't treat him badly was the one who was communicating honestly with him. At this point, the only ones I don't want dead are White (Fruiaz), Mio, Ta, and Cooper. I don't want no more hurt to come Non.

I commented twice and didn't know where they went. However, this is the Thai male version of Mean Girls. Por and the other treated Non, like he was a piece of trash. Taking credit for work, they had no hand they were bullying him. You can see he has no friends, low esteem.
