epนี้ชอบตอนที่ฟลุ้คหลอนเห็นผีหน้ากากปรากฎตัวซ้ายทีขวาที บั๊มแสดงให้คนดูเชื่อได้ว่าเค้ากำลังหลอนและกลัวจนไม่สามารถแยกแยะได้ ทั้งสีหน้าเสียงภาษากายมันสื่อให้เห็นชัดเจนเลย ส่วนของมุมกล้องและภาพที่สั่นๆทำให้คนดูรู้สึกตามไปได้เลยว่าตัวละครกำลังหลอนมากๆอยู่

Barcode is a really great actor.💗 Also the character Non is a very sexual character he’s acting out of lust because he thinks he can get true love in return from his partner and side pieces.

Why would Non decide to write a script for people who call him greasy? Why would be Tee would ever want to help him? Non’s Common sense is out of the window. The only person i feel bad about is Phee; he had tears in his eyes and had a gut feeling that Non was lying.

Also, I want all of the bully crew to get what's coming to them. I want White to know the real Tee, Por, Fluke etc. It makes me sad and livid with how they treated Non. That's why you can't treat people any kind of way. Now you're going to pay for it.

"i want white to know the real tee." THIS PART. white is a sweetheart (from what we've seen) and he is with that ahole!? like how much has he really changed? remember when him and top almost left everyone until he looked on his phone and remembered he had a man to protect?

Why did y'all erase my comments??? I feel so bad for Non. Everyone was taking advantage of him in every way possible. The teacher and his so-called friends did him wrong. I was definitely on the side of Jin until he did what he did. I don't know what he was thinking.

I never understood why ppl thought Jinn was a good friend. I always thought something was a little off. Plus I always noticed Non seemed uncomfortable when Jinn would touch him.🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤔🤔🤔

I couldn’t have prepared myself for the content in this episode. I just hope protection was used on Non.
