Why is Non's nicknameEnglish- translated "Sticky Bug" in this version while in the actual episodes it's "Greasy"?

It's actually wild that most of these guys are in this show because they won an acting competition

just like Kinnporsche the shock factor is amazing! the amount of twists in the show are crazy there is so much unexpected stuff that happends. this is now in my top 10 BLs BOC definitely makes great shows, that was proven yet again!

ชอบตอนนี้นะ มันมีความกุ๊กกิ๊ก กรุบกริบของพีจิน ความน่ากลัวไปอยู่ที่ฟลุ๊คด้วยที่ดูหลอนๆ แบบตอนพูดกับไวท์ที่เปิดคลิปอ่ะ แล้วยังเห็นหน้ากากกันทั้งหมด สนุกมากกกกกกก

The fact that they left without caring anyone else one has a boyfriend and the other has best friends apparently. I understand they are scared but I you so called care for the others then actually help 😒

I started watching for Barcode...when will he get more screen time? But now I'm watching for TaCopper as well. Also, Fluke needs to chill. He's scary!

I’ve stopped watching this series, the acting is not good and the story line is to far fetched, was looking forward to this series, but was disappointed in it, after KinnPorche series being so good, was expecting better, but hey other ppl may enjoy, just not me 🥲

Is It Just Me Or Does Anyone Else Feel Like Tan Has An Ulterior Motive.? Like Maybe He’s There To Find Out What Happened To Non Specifically. Or Maybe He’s Helping Him…🤷🏾‍♀️

I’m Enjoying This But I Think They All Still Have A Lot Of Learning To Do. So Far The Only Naturalish Actors Are Ta, Fuaiz, Mío & Us. Fuaiz Is Pretty Good In This Episode. & If Ta Could Loosen Up A Bit He’d Appear More Natural But He’s Still Good.

Acting is a little…hmmmmm. Many weird plot holes. Coming from the same company that made KinnPorsche I had high hopes. But I will keep going cus I’m still intrigued. Not many horror y series out there at all.

I think in the end, it’s just going to be all an act. They improved on their past mistakes this time around. We shall see.

Oh, how I love BL series that have a bigger idea for a plot than just a love story 💗 Like ones that have boys love in it while not being the central idea of the plot, aka Horror BL or BL with special abilities in it🤞
