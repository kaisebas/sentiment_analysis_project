My heart broke for Phee, especially when he was crying silently during the first confrontation about Non and Keng. Phee would have walked through fire for Non if only he knew about what was going on. I really wanted Phee to understand that Non was basically groomed by Keng but it would be unrealistic to expect teenager to think that far.

At the same time I felt so sad for Non. He is back to being alone now that the only person who loved him is left. I don’t see what Non did as cheating per se because I think Non was overwhelmed but didn’t want to burden Phee with his problems so he basically fell into Keng’s arms when Keng showed him the slightest bit of concern.

I was also rooting for Jin to stand up to his asshole “friends” but nah bro has no spine. Oh well I guess its realistic for teens to succumb to peer pressure and bully others or be a bystander.

Now I’ll just wait for Phee to enact whatever master plan he has to yeet all these mofos off the face of Earth.

And seriously Jin? Your first reaction upon seeing your teacher and your underage crush doing the bam bam in the ham ham is to film it rather than call the popo? Teenagers aren’t the best decision makers especially when emotional but this takes the cake.

It's very age-typical, though. Hell, even a lot of adults would look at this and label it 'just sex' and that Keng isn't doing anything wrong. Jin was wrong to record it but as an angry, heartbroken teen in love I can kind of understand he wasn't thinking clearly.

Not me pausing every 2 mins 💀 absolutely losing my mind. Phee has been my favorite character from the start and this ep really solidified that.

I feel bad for Non, he was going through so many things at once and on top of that some creep ass teacher just had to come and groom him.

I’m excited to watch how exactly Phee plays into everything in the present day, and how exactly his complicated relationship with Jin started 🤨 next week can’t come fast enough

The PheeJin relationship is sort of twisted if you think about it. Phee seems like he’s trying to find out what happened to Non and it seems like during the process he falls for Jin. Meanwhile Jin was sort of the catalyst for the non/Phee break up.  It could be a sad ending for them.  Because I’m assuming Non is dead.

Unless Phee already knows about Jin posting that clip when they reunite. I'm kinda digging all these plot twists because it seems they were really well thought of since the beginning and they weren't just writing thinking what next? I''m so here for this series TBH.

It was left vague if Jin posted the clip or not. It seemed like he didn’t and it may be one of the other boys.  I have doubts that Phee and Jin knew about each other prior to Non’s disappearance/death. They kept having near misses this episode probably on purpose. When they finally tell each other the truth it’s gonna be a big moment in the show.

Definitely they didn't know each other before Non disappeared. But I do believe that things might still happen before we go back to the future.

But it's true that he uploaded the clip to that drive and that anyone might have got to it and posted it. Anyways, he did record it and he was responsible of leaving it to the other's mercy.

It took me two hours to finish watching because I had to keep pausing to process what I was seeing… Non should be happy and it sucks sooooooo many things keep pushing him in the direction he’s going.

I wish Jin had a backbone when it comes to his friends. Ultimately, I’m here for Phee and idc what happens to everyone else.

This is honestly one of the best BL I've seen in a while. I was turned off by the horror premise, but stuck with it, and now, it's definitely in the running for one of my favorite BL ever. The one thing I really appreciate about this show is how intricately written it is. Every single character has good, believable motivations for their actions that range across the morality spectrum, and you find yourself vacillating between how you feel about characters from one episode to the next. I love it! Sammon and the rest of the writing team did that! Also, as spineless as he is, Fluke is the only character I'm really behind, excluding Non and Phee, of course.

Upon re-evaluation though, it doesn't seem like he sent it before the laptop died. I wonder if this was a misdirect. If he put it on a shared drive or something that the other group members could see, it's super plausible that one of them was the one that did it.

Honestly though, even if Jin wasn't the one to send it, Non's life was basically ruined by Jin having a crush on him. Jin brought him into the group, which set off the money problems, is convincing him to stay to finish the film, etc.

Poor Phee :(. Also, I had to pause about 1 minute in because EXCUSE ME Papa Phee? Who is he, he is an absolute snack.

The tutor is the worst and I'm glad he will apparently die painfully based on the bloody ghost vision they saw in the previous episode.

Non has been made so desperate by everything around him that he's making bad decisions ie: lying to Phee about the money and about Keng preying on him. Phee would have moved the world to help Non, which is the saddest part.

He is manipulating whom????? His life is a misery one after another. Did he force the teacher to rape him????? The only reason he lied to Phee was a mixture of shame and not wanting to get him involved in his miserable situation.

This show has me so good with the way I was ready to abandon it last week and got sucked back in anyway 😭

I feel terrible for what's happening but at the same time I'm also thrilled at execution of some character development that I had been hoping and waiting for.

We finally got two things: Non shifting from being purely an innocent character who has done and can do no wrong (particularly in audience perception) to someone who is more nuanced than that, and insight into Phee.

I think it's very likely that Non has been abused or had something happen to him in the past. Or perhaps it's just the family dynamics and what he's facing at home, but either way it's clear that he has a few things going on: he's desperate for physical affection, he's depression, he's anxious, he feels the need to take care of himself and not be a burden to anyone. All of these drive his behaviour and make him make TERRIBLE decisions that are also completely understandable and human.

Also I just want to state this clearly: Non is not 'cheating', he is being sexually coerced by his teacher. There is a difference! Where he goes wrong is in lying to Phee and manipulating him into second guessing his thoughts, etc, and it seems that he's cheated in the past and that's obviously wrong. But when it comes to what's going on with Keng, he is clearly being manipulated and coerced.

I feel so badly for Phee after this episode. Right from the start I felt like there was more to what was going on there and that there'd be an explanation for him having Jin at arm's length etc and I got it. I feel so badly for him. Also I'm more sure than ever (unless BOC really does go down the 'stone-cold killer' route) that his involvement with Jin isn't just revenge. We saw how upset he was about Non and how he feels about cheating, I just can't see him using sex as a weapon. Like okay if he used it to get close to Jin in the past, but again in the forest...? It just doesn't click for me.

And my poor baby boy Jin. I wondered what changed him from the fairly happy-go-lucky boy in the past to how he seems in the present and I got the answer... Personally I don't think that he's the one who released the recording. We saw his laptop short out so at the least we know that he didn't do it deliberately. There's also a scene earlier in the show where Fluke talks to White, Tee and Tan about a video being released and since we know that White and Tan aren't involved, my money is on Tee, Top or Por having been the ones who did it. There's a screenshot floating around that shows icloud drive in the sidebar so I'm guessing Jin saved it somewhere the others could access it.

Also I'm amazed at how many layers we have going on here!

We have:

Phee/Jin/Non

Non/Keng

Non vs the bullies

the money laundering

Keng's sidebar with the investigative reporter

the mystery in the past & the mystery in the present

how do White & Tan fit in?

who does Perth play? lol

And there are still so many questions we need answers to: what happened to Non? What happened to Keng? How did Tee's uncle end up dead?

Is it next Saturday yet?

So they really looked at barcode and were like « so you did not kiss anyone during KP ? Yeah that’s sad. Let’s have you kiss people now. »

I mean he only misses Us and he pinned the whole ex-KP cast 🥲

Oh god these KengNon had me so uncomfortable I had to walk back and forth in my homeroom to try to disperse some awkwardness. While TaBarcode was unexpectedly excellent and cathartic, 2JBarcode was close to incest in my brain 🥲🥲

Also I am now going to go watch the start of the episode over and over and act as if that’s the only part that aired. Thank you.

For real now that serie is truly incredible. That whole episode was great. And… still did not answer half the questions we have about current time. I am barely coherent.

Shit’s about to go down next week !

Also Ta your the MVP. We talk about Barcode’s acting (and boy is our Code excellent and brilliant again and again) but TA’s acting is brilliant too. He was getting there but he just entered with burnished letters my BL actors hall of fame.

Yeah the entire scene for me was like 'no...nuh uh...no way they'll show that...NO...NOOOO...NONONONO!!!! 😩😩😩'

Ta is definitely coming into his own in this series. I actually thought his acting was a bit weak in the first couple eps since there were some scenes where I could tell he was reciting his lines vs acting them and pausing between words for dramatic effect (it was more noticeable for me since I understand Thai). Though after this ep I am a firm Ta/Phee believer and would follow him to any other series he lands!!

When I tell you I screamed!!!! This show is blowing my mind. It's going where we haven't gone before with a young cast like this. I'm shocked!!!

Like They've been selling TaCopper but boy, those of us that were shipping TaBarcode in KP?? We WERE SERVED those first minutes of this episode. Then creepy teacher got real creepy and I SCREAMED so loud, my dog went outside thinking I was scolding him. My husband came to check on me and everything. Non is really going the TSTL path going back to those "friends". They bully him, he knows they are only taking advantage of him... I need to know what's in it for him. It must not be only the movie. Jin??? What were you thinking??? He was all jealous and he had only a lousy attempt at kissing Non. What in the entitlement was that??

Now, Phee. I remember we wanted him to suffer a little bit after what he seemed to have done to Jin but boy I get it. I totally get it. He gave his heart to Non and he was crushed and I suppose he's gonna learn about Jin posting that clip and I... Ugh. Those are gonna be the last words he's gonna say to Non, right? Ominous.

My heart. This episode was EVERYTHING!!! And now we are getting Non embracing wholeheartedly his villain era. Bring it on.

God, poor Non.

Part of me wants to say “why doesn’t he just get away from those bullies” or “why doesn’t he just tell the teacher no” but I also understand why it isn’t that simple. Why should he let them make the film without him and take all the credit when he’s the one who wrote it? And obviously when it comes to the teacher I can’t blame him for that. He feels obligated because of the money. And of course the fault should always fall with the creepy ass teacher in this situation because of the power imbalance.

But I still feel very bad for Non. He can’t catch a break. I do not feel sympathy for Jin, talking about “waaah I didn’t mean to upload the video” but like you drafted the tweet. If you were a good friend you wouldn’t have ever even done that. Taking the video I understand, I thought he would use it to help Non report the teacher. But that wasn’t the case.

I wish Non would just tell his “friends” that Tee is the one behind the shady bank accounts. Also I’m curious how Phee ends up getting involved with the rest of the group. I appreciate these flashback episodes of course but I am also eager to get back to the present to see what will happen next! In conclusion, fuck all those people except Non and Phee. Poor babies :(

This is exactly why in the future Phee could not commit to Jin. Non ruined him and this is how good men turn bad!

Okay it makes a lot of sense that barcode had to stress so much that he was an adult making his own decisions, this role is getting more and more complex! And there’s still more to go! Though I feel like next episode will be climax of his arc after which we will return to the present.

The beginning montage was everything! Ta and barcode have consistently given us top notch aesthetics, the way they fit together is unreal. They were cute yet sexy, truly the sweetheart romance anyone would ever want.

The way it contrasts with the badwrong aesthetic of barcode and jj is a whiplash! Ngl I need to put a genuine apology, I did think jj would be a nice wholesome teacher who just happened to be super hot. But I guess no such thing!

Still can’t believe such a show actually exists and got made! And next Saturday is too far away!

I’m loving how this show is structured in three acts. (Just an educated guess this is how it’s going to unfold) Act 1 (eps 1-4): The Present. Setting the scene. Act 2(eps 5-8): The Backstory Act 3 (eps 9-12): Back to the present with the new info. Resolution/Revenge

Also, with the newbie gang of Phee, Tan, and White - supernatural stuff happened in front of Phee and Tan but they didn’t see it. But White saw himself with boils all over him, which has nothing to do with any of the other supernatural stuff thus far. Is he tied with Kent and the cult?

Godddddd the first scene absolutely SERVED in the TaBarcode department, now I feel spoiled and want an actual TaCode series to happen!!! 😩😩😩 They were so soft, so warm together, UGH just makes me want to ignore what happened throughout the rest of the episode 🫤 BOC was READY to drop Barcode into ALL the mature scenes once he turned 18 lol.

2J you are hot and I love you as a person but wow you play the creeper teacher SO well. I couldn't even enjoy your shirtlessness because the scene with Non made me SO uncomfortable. Non looked absolutely anxious/scared during those scenes like ugh I'm so sad Non got groomed by this man and probably thinks he has to repay him with his body to feel like he doesn't owe him anything. Also side note I wonder if the 'ghost' of Keng that we see earlier in the series is because Keng was investigating the boys at their set and got caught and killed by a hitman sent by Tee's boss based on the ep preview 🤔

AND JIN I TRUSTED YOU!! He had so many opportunities to actually HELP Non but didn't act on them :( and when he finally did something it ended up ruining Non and Phee. He might've not been the one to actually leak the sex tape but he was def complicit for filming it in the first place. Gah there better be a redemption arc for him if they want me to get behind PheeJin when we're back in the present 😔

Regardless of all the drama and feelings I'm sooooooo pumped for the next episode, this show keeps on GIVING. In the meantime you can find me replaying the first couple of scenes over and over again pretending that it's an extension of my happy MacauChay fantasies 💁🏻‍♀️

Holy fuck, what an episode.

- These people are all so fucking punchable. Por and Top especially. Us and Jet are doing a great job with just LOOKING like smug pieces of shit. I'm so glad that Por died in agony LOL

- Even though Tee sucks massive shits, I still kinda like him??? Where Por and Top are just absolutely selfish narcissists and Fluke is so fucking spineless and only caring about being a doctor, Tee has some dimensions to him. He's obviously in his life to help his father, and in the present we see that while Top and Fluke are only out for themselves, Tee at least cared about White so he has the capacity to care about others, and also the capacity to be a complete asshole.

- Well, we all knew that Keng was a giant predator.

- Jin, Jin, Jin.... holy fuck I did NOT expect that to happen. It makes sense though - he is the 'nicest' one of this group, but he still hangs out with them, so he definitely had the capacity to be shitty. He immediately knew that he'd done bad though. He fucking RUINED Non's life with one click because he was jealous and upset (which... he's a teenager so it does make sense)

- Phee is so in love with Non. He would (or at least would have) gone through hell for him, and is currently going through hell for him. The way Ta and Barcode acted the first confrontation was so good. And the way Non crumpled just a little in Phee's arms when they hugged - if only you'd just been up front about everything, Non. Phee would have helped you. But now this paints Phee and Jin so differently than even we thought last week. From week to week, the perspectives are changing. I can't wait to rewatch this show afterwards with all the new perspectives.

- Damn, next week looks like Non is going to lose it. I can't wait to see it.

This show is so goddamn good.

Yes, yes, yes! Exactly! Everything makes sense - they are acting like very realistic teenagers with dumb decision making that isn't just for plot, but feels like what would really happen with these mentally flawed characters. When teenagers like these who have stripes of shittiness in their personality are met with emotional situations and have zero critical thinking skills, this kind of stuff happens.

This show is so good. It's so much more than just a horror show or a BL show or a psychological thriller show. It's everything and more.

Honeslty as much as I try to hate Tee, he just keeps serving!!! I mean the dimesionality of him is honestly incredible, easily one of the best thought out characters I've ever seen. The way that his bullying of non caused like literally EVERYTHING, but still doesn't do petty things like shove non is so psychopath I love it but hate him. I still wanna believe that white doesn't like him at all, but BRO IS SO HOT LIKE DO I BLAME HIM IF HE ACTUALLY DOES???

idk I'm going through it rn especially after that one smirk haha. i wanna know all the white theories tho! The two characters who get in my brain the most XD

I just want to say one thing - BOC really have gold on their hands with their actors. The emotions I felt while watching this episode - from sadness, to frustration, to feeling sick to my stomach, it all felt so raw, as if I was there experiencing whatever the characters were. I hardly get to feel so connected and emotionally affected by a BL series but this one is doing it for me.

I don't understand why this series is so underrated - although it's been gaining popularity, I still think it's one of those gems that deserves to be appreciated more. Maybe people are put off by the horror aspect of it and this is why they're not giving it a chance but anyways, I hope more and more will get to appreciate DFF in the future.

Now about the episode.. I am so curious to find out exactly what the friend group did to Non and I think that we'll be getting the answer to that question next week. Also, I am excited for when the flashbacks are over and we are back to the present because now I'll be watching with a so much more different perspective and will be seeing all the characters from different lenses. The mystery is so good and this whole "is there something supernatural or not" thing keeps me on my toes too.

Another thing I can't wait to find out is whether the theories about Tan being Non's older brother are true or if not, how did he get involved with those shitty ass friends.. Same as White, I'm so curious about how he ended up with all of them too. I can't wait to see if Phee and Jin are working together and exactly how much do they know of each other. And of course, the main mystery - is Non alive and who is the murderer.

Speaking of Jin.. I am so disappointed in him. First of all, his first reaction when seeing Non with the teacher was to pull out the phone and record? Then he posted said video? Sorry but with this he hurt Non so much more than Tee, Por and the others ever did. I've been cheering for him even if it always rubbed me the wrong way how he knew how much his friends hurt Non, how he knows what they did for him to disappear and decides to stay with them despite it but in this ep he reached a different low.. Unless it turns out he wasn't the one who posted the video I won't be rooting for him and Phee.

I can't stop thinking about this episode. If the quality keeps up like this, it's going to be my fave BL EVER along with Moonlight Chicken.

One thing I've been wondering though - did we see the suicide attempt out of order chronologically? Did Phee come back to help him after the breakup because after he cooled down, he started connecting dots, and couldn't reach Non and got worried? I mean, he wouldn't have been so furious if he didn't deeply care for and love Non.

This episode woke up and choose violence, lot of people are not going to be happy. There is so much to like about this series, I quite like the complexity of Non's character, and this episode is absolutely his villian origin story. It's be nice if we could get some more horror but looks like next week Non is going to come unhinged.

32:52 - surprise kiss

42:04 - oh boy we finally got some spice but probably not the one you want.

Phee is like the best thing that happened to Non, and because of a bunch of insecure loosers Non ended up lying and hurting Phee!!! 😭😭😭🤧💔💔💔 I'm shaking ffs! 

What did Non ever do to anyone for them to bully him so much, to take advantage of him so much?! And I was freaking having hopes that Jin was a good person, but God damn what the heck?!! When he did that I was screaming into my pillow for 10 minutes straight! 

I wanna take them all, put them in a bag, and throw them to the sharks along with those stupid scammers!!!"

And to know Phee end up with Jin later on not knowing what Jin did... 💀☠️⚰️💔

In light of this episode I went back to watch from the beginning and sooo many dropped hints are making sense. But there’s still so much to figure out. The show opens with Jin and Non being hunted by the masked figure, but where does that land in the timeline? Is there more than one killer? As I type I can only come up with more questions…

There’s also the aspect of how do Tan and White fit into this group. We know they come into play in 12th grade so how do they (and Phee) become key parts of the group?? This show is going to do my head in lol a week is too long for the next episode.

Well I wanted TaBarcode scenes, and boy did I get them 😆. What a rollercoaster.

Don’t come for me, but there’s only so much of the constant pile on of a character that I can take before I just get annoyed with the story. I’m ready for a break from Non, it’s just too much all the time. I get they’re showing us how he gets to his breaking point, but I’ve been over it. And I do considering it cheating, in a really disgusting manner, and he lied to his boyfriend’s face. He digs his holes deeper and doesn’t use the brain he’s got.

Phee’s the ❤️ for me, this episode only confirmed what I knew. I couldn’t help but feel he was being manipulated this whole time by Non. I thought Ta was wonderful, esp. when he sees Non/Pedophile Teacher coming down the escalator together.

I’m ready to jump forward in the flashback, to Tan/White/Phee/Jin parts.

I don't see it as cheating so much as the lying part. Keng groomed Non when he was at his most emotionally vulnerable, but the fact that he didn't tell Phee about the money in the first place and then about having sex with Keng, when Phee asked him OUTRIGHT twice if there was anything he was hiding... that was the part that broke Phee. If Non had asked for help with the money or with help with Keng, Phee would have given it to him. I mean, he already got a police investigation fixed for him.

It's not cheating, he's being sexually coerced by his teacher. It seems possible to me that he may have been abused in the past would explain a whole lot about his characterization and mental health.

Like fault him for lying to Phee, sure, 100% - but don't call him being preyed on by his teacher 'cheating'.

Sorry if my post triggered or pissed anyone off, I’ll admit I posted this right after it aired, so I was irritable, venting, and typing 😆.

Of course, this is way more nuanced, way more complex than cheating. And I know it’s all being ripped away from him, but I still view Non as still having his own agency, at least at this point. So, the choice he made to lie, not be honest is what burns the worst. And the escalator scene just came off so casual on his part.

I’m ride or die for Phee at this point, I just always want him to have the upper hand, but that wouldn’t be interesting at all, so I’ll just have to deal with it, cause I can’t quit the show now that it’s gotten good.

I thought his story was a revenge story, but now I’m really not sure anymore. He might reluctantly get pulled back in by someone else, like New.

Glad I’m rewatching Last Twilight to offset this show😆😆😆, Mhok/Day definitely help with the feels.

The characters I despite are Tee his so horrible, Fluke just goes with the crowd, Top blames everything he does on someone else or gets his friends to fix his problems, Por is horrible hes very arrogant and superficial he thinks having money gives him status. Jin is such a bystander he literally watching his get bullied rather than to help him no back bone he should grow one. Non is literally just a victim whos just succumbing to peer pressure. Non literally is naive and believes that those group of people are his friends when in reality just using him to escape from their own problems when Non has his own problems. Phee is literally such a sweetheart... hes so in love with Non that he would go to the end of the world with him, literally do anything for him and Mr Kang that teacher is a groomer who just using Non for his sexual pleasures which is disgusting since Non is literally underaged..

Oh man, what an episode. This might be an unpopular opinion but Non certainly just keeps digging his own hole deeper and deeper. Making a bunch of shitty decisions, even if desperate. At this point I’m kind of done with him (i’m sorry🫣).

Also Phee is such a champ, I’m very curious how this situation with him and Jin will work out, since Jin leaked that video and all🥶. Phee better be alive by the end of this🥲.

Also damn, Jin, I did not see that one coming😬.

I need to go back and rewatch the series so far because there’s so many different truths coming out. But also I get Jin liked Non but he never tried saying anything?? And his attempts to “save” Non from his friends felt weak?? Idk idk idk it’s so much to work through.

Probably you won't believe me but I swear I was having anxiety watching the episode and I was not wrong.

Oh Non, my poor child, you were so obsessed with not needing help that you ended up hitting rock bottom.

I'm so glad that the teacher ends up dead in the present. He R***D a teenager using money and Non's despair.

Jin didn't leak the video but he clearly shared it with his shitty friends and one of them (probably Tee, Top Or Por) leaked it just for the laughs. Stupid Jin you were the last nail in Non's coffin.

Non probably will go apeshit and end up murdered by the b******s or taking his own life in the forest.

Poor Phee, he (and Non actually) were the real victims of all this shit, Phee telling Non to "get lost and die" were probably his last words and it took a toll on him and it's probably the reason of the revenge.

At this time I want Phee killing all of them in the forest. Nobody of these trash deserve to live.

I finally was able to see the last two episodes, and OMG, so much stuff is going on!!

As some of you mentioned already, I am not sure that Jin is the one who released the video (he didn't press the button and the computer crashed because of the beer and not the keyboard getting pressured to post the video), and it may be one of the other a**** since apparently the video has been saved on the cloud. I am not justifying the fact he took the video; that was an a** move of his part, but he's heartbroken and he saw that Non was with a guys in clearly a romantic way ( I don't think he saw Phee face), so for him, I think the logic is "Non = cheater and liar, I need to confront him or something."

Poor Phee, he deserves so much love for how supportive he is...

Speaking of Phee and Non, yes, Non is so much in his mess that he will do anything to get out ( that explain the teacher thing) but - it is a controversial idea - It seems that he used to have a certain behavior (according to Phee) and is under a load of medication so maybe—and again, it is a controversial idea- it is not the first time he cheated on Phee (I doubt that) or he used to have more than 1 FWB. Also he's still lying to Phee, not about the money but about the movie too. The scene when he talked to Phee about continuing filming even though they were bullying him make me think that he may have a bit of a feeling for Jin and that what make Phee worried about. Also maybe Non have some emotional issues ( go back to the pills, I'll say depression) and a kind of imprintment disorder. OR I'm totally wrong and just overanalyse everything.

Waah I'm mindblown.. Tbh i was getting bored with the show in the beginning (no offense to the actors but it was full of unnecessary jumpscares and blood..i was not feeling it...it felt slow)...

But entrance of non changed this show.... And wow boc really did good job hiring barcode he really is so talented I'm impressed with his acting... Out of those frnds i only can forgive (fluke that med student with glasses)... He was a silent bystander which is a bad thing still he didn't directly hurt non yet so i think he needs to be exempted...

Others all can got to hell even that tee guy screw him i know ur father's health matters and he's stuck with his uncle still he really messed up non's life terribly (just bcoz ur miserable doesn't mean u can drag ppl to hell nd nxt week preview seems like he'll help his uncle to kill Non🙄😒)

And non I might sound like a sadist 🤡 but i support him... He's spiralling like crazy in next ep and is about to die..but I'm curious🤡.....he lost Phee and is all alone... I know the Tutor will ness up everything.. So with no support no wonder he goes crazy

😕now Phee/his cop father is involved too... I know it's going to end badly🤡

Jin too like waah he's the wolf in sheep's clothing screw him... Idc abt pheejin now (eventho phee forgives jin etc etc whatever) I'll never forgive him for what he did to Non.. It's horrible to be viewed when doing stuff nd sharing in twitter😒 disgusting

And 🤡 i always thought Jj was hot in kinnporsche ... Nd he's still hot aaaaaahhh... Boc will survive if they continue making unique shows👍 and also if they don't let go of the writer especially writer Sammon (she wrote Triage ofc i know she's talented love her❤)

I can't imagine how a teen like Non will handle all this shit... I pity him poor soul😕

Waah love this series ... It has all the elements i like... Waah I'm enjoying it❤they gave tabarcode.... Jjbarcode🤡still against grooming tho 🙄 ... But barcode really is that hidden card in the series

These flashback episodes have been so heartbreaking, I was literally bawling at the end of the last one. But they are also an absolute masterclass at constructing a person’s downward spiral and it would be completely understandable if Non did snap and is the killer. Or if he killed himself, tbh. If the latter did happen though, my heart would break for Phee, he probably blames himself the most for not being able to protect the guy he loved. And telling Non to go and die probably haunts him.

Also in present day, it has got to be Phee and Tan in this revenge plot together. I remember Jin having mentioned that they were particularly close, even to the point that Jin thought they were sleeping together too. If Tan was the brother - New - it would make complete sense that they infiltrated this friend group together. White though, I feel like he may have been a victim of bullying in the past. It would be a huge conflict with Tee, once all his previous actions get revealed, and maybe help Tee realize the gravity of his actions. Not a redemption because let’s be honest he doesn’t deserve one, but an interesting arc for sure.

Originally posted this on the wrong ep, but I figured it out!

I honestly wondered if BOC would be "saving" Barcode's first on-screen kiss for Jeff in Wuju Bakery, but LORD.


THAT YOUNG MAN GOT SOME THIS WEEK.


Like, I genuinely gasped at the sneaky kiss, and then my brain me l t e d with what followed.


So so so proud of Barcode and Ta this week! Acting was INCREDIBLE!

Jin didn’t do well even he wanted phee he could have done it in a nice way than taking that video of them so he was the cus of the break up but no matter what he did when phee took Jin to the river side you guys remember what he said to Jin he will never forget Non
